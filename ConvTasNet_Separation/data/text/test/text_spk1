121-127105-0026_4446-2273-0033 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN

121-127105-0026_7127-75946-0017 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
121-127105-0028_4507-16021-0025 THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0029_5142-33396-0065 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0029_8455-210777-0048 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0031_260-123288-0009 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0031_5142-33396-0046 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0032_7127-75947-0037 YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
121-127105-0034_2830-3980-0000 IT SOUNDED DULL IT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
121-127105-0035_1995-1826-0013 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0035_2961-961-0004 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0036_2961-960-0012 BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
121-127105-0036_5683-32865-0005 BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
1221-135766-0000_1580-141083-0013 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0002_121-127105-0005 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003_1320-122617-0009 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0003_908-31957-0002 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004_237-126133-0022 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0004_5105-28240-0011 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0006_7176-92135-0040 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007_121-121726-0005 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008_7127-75946-0003 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009_5142-33396-0058 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0012_6930-76324-0003 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013_121-127105-0028 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0013_1284-1181-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD

1221-135766-0014_7127-75946-0004 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135767-0001_7127-75947-0008 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0005_61-70970-0020 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE

1221-135767-0009_237-134500-0033 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010_1995-1837-0021 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0010_2830-3980-0039 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0013_5683-32865-0007 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014_1089-134691-0023 YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH

1221-135767-0016_4970-29093-0012 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0020_61-70968-0009 IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0022_7176-92135-0032 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0024_2094-142345-0028 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1221-135767-0024_8555-284449-0015 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1284-1180-0001_1580-141083-0003 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED

1284-1180-0004_8455-210777-0031 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005_6829-68771-0000 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006_121-127105-0022 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED

2830-3979-0006_237-126133-0014 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0007_3575-170457-0045 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008_672-122797-0026 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROERER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009_1580-141083-0026 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE

2830-3980-0005_5142-33396-0003 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006_7127-75946-0014 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007_5142-33396-0026 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN

2830-3980-0008_121-127105-0013 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009_260-123286-0015 PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0011_2300-131720-0027 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN

2830-3980-0019_7021-79730-0009 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0022_8555-292519-0010 THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0024_1188-133604-0000 IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025_1995-1826-0001 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0028_6829-68771-0000 THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0031_1089-134686-0025 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032_237-134500-0010 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN

2830-3980-0047_1284-1181-0013 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY

2830-3980-0054_237-134500-0034 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE

2830-3980-0070_3570-5694-0005 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071_5142-33396-0024 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
2830-3980-0072_3575-170457-0021 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0072_6930-81414-0008 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0073_2300-131720-0015 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0075_4507-16021-0002 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0075_8463-294825-0003 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076_237-126133-0009 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2830-3980-0076_8463-287645-0002 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0005_6829-68771-0003 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006_5683-32866-0028 THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007_3729-6852-0002 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0007_4446-2271-0020 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0007_672-122797-0017 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008_7176-92135-0015 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009_1995-1826-0023 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0009_6829-68769-0027 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0012_6829-68771-0015 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
2961-960-0013_1089-134686-0035 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014_2830-3980-0010 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0014_5105-28240-0002 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0014_7176-92135-0000 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0015_8555-284449-0001 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016_4992-41806-0004 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0016_6829-68769-0005 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0017_6829-68769-0004 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0017_7729-102255-0014 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018_6930-76324-0020 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019_1320-122612-0007 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020_2094-142345-0006 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0020_237-134493-0005 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0022_4970-29095-0027 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
2961-961-0000_1320-122617-0014 SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0000_237-134500-0013 SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001_61-70968-0016 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0001_7127-75947-0013 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0004_7729-102255-0040 LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLON'S WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROPIDAS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME

2961-961-0006_8555-292519-0005 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007_6930-76324-0016 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0007_7127-75947-0023 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008_4992-23283-0002 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAS PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS

2961-961-0010_4992-41797-0015 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0010_7127-75946-0007 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES

2961-961-0012_4992-41797-0016 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013_4077-13751-0007 SOLON MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS

2961-961-0014_237-126133-0008 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD
2961-961-0015_5683-32865-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016_237-134500-0012 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0018_8555-284447-0004 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
2961-961-0020_4446-2275-0012 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0020_5142-33396-0003 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
3570-5694-0000_7176-88083-0002 BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALISED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001_1089-134691-0022 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0001_908-31957-0012 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002_61-70968-0032 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0004_4992-23283-0020 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0007_2300-131720-0027 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0007_5142-36377-0003 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0007_672-122797-0059 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008_237-126133-0023 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0008_7021-79740-0002 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0010_5142-33396-0011 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0010_7176-92135-0002 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL

3570-5694-0011_672-122797-0074 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0013_3575-170457-0017 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0013_3575-170457-0030 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014_4507-16021-0052 MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
3570-5694-0015_6829-68771-0010 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0015_8463-294828-0028 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0017_1221-135766-0013 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0017_4970-29095-0012 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0017_61-70970-0016 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018_1188-133604-0041 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0018_121-127105-0036 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0018_8555-284447-0010 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019_5105-28240-0024 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0019_6930-75918-0006 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0020_4446-2273-0000 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021_237-134500-0014 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5695-0000_5105-28233-0006 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
3570-5695-0001_672-122797-0050 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002_8230-279154-0000 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003_3575-170457-0032 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0003_8455-210777-0024 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004_237-126133-0015 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
3570-5695-0004_8455-210777-0010 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
3570-5695-0006_1284-1181-0015 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0006_3575-170457-0053 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007_5105-28233-0001 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008_7021-79759-0003 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
3570-5695-0009_237-134500-0032 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0009_2961-961-0017 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0009_4970-29095-0008 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010_5105-28240-0015 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0010_672-122797-0058 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011_4507-16021-0056 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0011_6829-68771-0009 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0011_8455-210777-0058 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012_5142-33396-0022 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0015_1580-141084-0000 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5695-0015_6829-68771-0036 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5695-0015_8463-294828-0037 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0002_237-134500-0016 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0002_5105-28240-0004 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0004_1320-122617-0023 THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0006_260-123286-0006 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0006_4507-16021-0021 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0006_8555-284449-0008 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007_1995-1837-0003 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0007_260-123286-0016 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0007_5639-40744-0024 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008_4446-2271-0005 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009_7729-102255-0016 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3575-170457-0000_672-122797-0005 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0003_7021-85628-0019 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0003_7127-75947-0025 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004_8463-294825-0008 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION
3575-170457-0005_6829-68769-0006 SHE A TORY AND CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DISSENT AND RADICALISM
