3081-166546-0081_5694-64029-0014 THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
3081-166546-0082_174-50561-0008 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0082_3536-23268-0026 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER

3081-166546-0085_1462-170142-0022 BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086_1673-143397-0004 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
3081-166546-0086_8842-302201-0005 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
3081-166546-0088_7850-286674-0011 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089_251-137823-0003 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
3170-137482-0002_3576-138058-0017 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
3170-137482-0003_5536-43359-0002 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
3170-137482-0004_3576-138058-0040 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER

3170-137482-0005_2078-142845-0035 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES

3170-137482-0007_422-122949-0015 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
3170-137482-0008_5694-64029-0024 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS

3170-137482-0014_2412-153954-0002 NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
3170-137482-0016_1462-170142-0021 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
3170-137482-0016_5895-34622-0001 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
3170-137482-0017_6313-66129-0025 IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
3170-137482-0018_1272-141231-0023 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
3170-137482-0019_2428-83699-0005 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
3170-137482-0019_3000-15664-0040 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
3170-137482-0020_6241-61943-0003 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
3170-137482-0021_1673-143396-0005 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
3170-137482-0021_3081-166546-0061 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
3170-137482-0022_6241-61943-0018 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
3170-137482-0024_7850-73752-0008 THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
3170-137482-0024_7976-110523-0011 THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
3170-137482-0027_251-136532-0015 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION

3170-137482-0034_1462-170138-0006 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
3170-137482-0036_1993-147966-0006 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
3170-137482-0037_2902-9008-0013 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS

3170-137482-0040_2428-83699-0025 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
3170-137482-0040_3536-8226-0011 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
