19-198-0001_27-123349-0024.wav,this little work was finished in the year eighteen o three and intended for immediate publication it was disposed of to a bookseller it was even advertised
19-198-0002_6078-54013-0002.wav,neither the author nor the public have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete
19-198-0004_7078-271888-0077.wav,chapter one no one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine her situation in life
19-198-0009_3526-176653-0031.wav,dark lank hair and strong features so much for her person and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind she was fond of all boy's plays and greatly preferred cricket
19-198-0011_2391-145015-0032.wav,and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take such were her propensities
19-198-0014_5456-24741-0021.wav,she learnt the fable of the hare and many friends as quickly as any girl in england her mother wished her to learn music and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet
19-198-0015_426-122822-0017.wav,so at eight years old she began she learnt a year and could not bear it and missus morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her to leave off
19-198-0019_5022-29405-0010.wav,her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement
19-198-0020_8770-295462-0022.wav,catherine grows quite a good looking girl she is almost pretty today were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds to look almost pretty
19-198-0022_1594-135914-0080.wav,that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback
19-198-0024_7800-283478-0017.wav,she had never any objection to books at all but from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable
19-198-0025_254-127705-0002.wav,many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air from thompson that it is a delightful task to teach the young idea how to shoot
19-198-0026_7511-102419-0017.wav,and from shakespeare she gained a great store of information amongst the rest that trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ
19-198-0029_2136-5140-0023.wav,she brought herself to read them and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte of her own composition she could listen to other people's performance with very little fatigue
19-198-0033_3723-171115-0054.wav,this was strange indeed but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out there was not one lord in the neighbourhood no not even a baronet
19-198-0034_1081-125237-0079.wav,there was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door not one young man whose origin was unknown her father had no ward and the squire of the parish no children
19-198-0036_6818-68772-0039.wav,who owned the chief of the property about fullerton the village in wiltshire where the morlands lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution and his lady a good humoured woman fond of miss morland and probably aware that if
19-227-0001_8095-274346-0026.wav,her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased she could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together walking round the garden and orchard again and again as if nothing but motion was voluntary
19-227-0003_4160-11549-0017.wav,but when a third night's rest had neither restored her cheerfulness improved her in useful activity nor given her a greater inclination for needlework she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of
19-227-0004_226-122538-0014.wav,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard's cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath
19-227-0007_8975-270782-0068.wav,that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast
19-227-0008_8419-286667-0025.wav,to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject
19-227-0013_426-122822-0013.wav,she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes till on entering the room the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before
19-227-0014_4788-94904-0026.wav,with a look of much respect he immediately rose and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as mister henry tilney with the embarrassment of real sensibility
19-227-0016_8051-119902-0005.wav,as the cause of his intrusion he did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart far from comprehending him or his sister in their father's misconduct
19-227-0019_118-47824-0076.wav,but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of the mirror for a future hour
19-227-0021_322-124147-0009.wav,missus morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him but mister morland was from home and being thus without any support at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say
19-227-0022_2843-152918-0060.wav,after a couple of minutes unbroken silence henry turning to catherine for the first time since her mother's entrance asked her with sudden alacrity if mister and missus allen were now at fullerton
19-227-0025_6147-34605-0021.wav,for missus morland thinking it probable as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours that he might have some explanation to give of his father's behaviour
19-227-0027_8108-274318-0044.wav,some explanation on his father's account he had to give but his first purpose was to explain himself and before they reached mister allen's grounds he had done it so well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often
19-227-0030_2817-142380-0027.wav,the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own a very short visit to missus allen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine
19-227-0031_5688-41232-0052.wav,scarcely opened her lips dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tete a tete and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application
19-227-0033_8629-261140-0000.wav,such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand the affrighted catherine amidst all the terrors of expectation as she listened to this account
19-227-0034_5390-30102-0013.wav,could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject
19-227-0039_669-129061-0038.wav,and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morland's engaging isabella but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself
19-227-0040_1363-139304-0010.wav,his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected
19-227-0048_374-180299-0003.wav,of miss morland's being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their treating her with parental kindness his resolution was soon formed
19-227-0050_8630-305212-0030.wav,catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children henry and eleanor perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father's particular respect
19-227-0051_5049-25947-0041.wav,had seen with astonishment the suddenness continuance and extent of his attention and though latterly from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her
19-227-0052_8465-246940-0025.wav,henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the late explanation at northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on
19-227-0055_4788-94904-0005.wav,and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the morlands confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character
19-227-0057_6019-3185-0001.wav,for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families with the most liberal proposals he had on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator
19-227-0058_460-172359-0014.wav,been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support they were in fact a necessitous family numerous too almost beyond example by no means respected in their own neighbourhood
19-227-0059_3879-173592-0026.wav,as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections a forward bragging scheming race
19-227-0061_302-123516-0035.wav,and he knew the young man on whom the fullerton estate must devolve the general needed no more enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself he set out the next day for the abbey where his performances have been seen
19-227-0062_2910-131096-0085.wav,i leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for henry to communicate at this time to catherine how much of it he could have learnt from his father
19-227-0064_83-9960-0012.wav,catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in suspecting general tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned against his character or magnified his cruelty
19-227-0066_5867-48852-0076.wav,the conversation between them at northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind henry's indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his father's views and being ordered to acquiesce in them
19-227-0067_150-126107-0027.wav,had been open and bold the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family prepared for no reluctance but of feeling
19-227-0068_8629-261140-0004.wav,no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words could ill brook the opposition of his son steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it but in such a cause his anger
19-227-0069_248-130652-0007.wav,though it must shock could not intimidate henry who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice he felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to miss morland
19-227-0072_5390-30096-0009.wav,the general was furious in his anger and they parted in dreadful disagreement henry in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose
26-495-0000_1034-121119-0014.wav,in sixteen sixty five written by a citizen who continued all the while in london never made public before
26-495-0004_3947-13260-0017.wav,and from them was handed about by word of mouth only so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation as they do now but it seems that the government had a true account of it
26-495-0013_441-130108-0036.wav,this possessed the heads of the people very much and few cared to go through drury lane or the other streets suspected unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it
26-495-0014_8312-279790-0007.wav,the usual number of burials in a week in the parishes of saint giles in the fields and saint andrew's holborn were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each few more or less
26-495-0017_229-130880-0061.wav,saint bride's zero saint james's eight
26-495-0023_2989-138035-0042.wav,still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over
26-495-0024_7059-77900-0037.wav,from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the eighteenth to the twenty fifth
26-495-0025_6476-96661-0022.wav,there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes
26-495-0027_4788-94904-0018.wav,there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and saint andrew's buried but fifteen which was very low
26-495-0028_1447-130552-0010.wav,but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but three hundred forty seven
26-495-0029_3440-171009-0017.wav,so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of saint giles
26-495-0030_412-126975-0046.wav,but this was all knavery and collusion
26-495-0033_198-126831-0029.wav,a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor's request
26-495-0035_2817-142371-0070.wav,our neighbourhood continued very easy but at the other end of the town their consternation was very great and the richer sort of people especially the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city
26-495-0036_6880-216547-0112.wav,in an unusual manner and this was more particularly seen in whitechappel that is to say the broad street where i lived indeed nothing was to be seen but waggons and carts with goods
26-495-0037_7302-86815-0028.wav,coaches filled with people of the better sort and horsemen attending them and all hurrying away then empty waggons and carts appeared and spare horses with servants who it was apparent
26-495-0038_5561-41616-0026.wav,were returning or sent from the countries to fetch more people besides innumerable numbers of men on horseback some alone others with servants and generally speaking
26-495-0039_1334-135589-0069.wav,as anyone might perceive by their appearance this was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see and as it was a sight which i could not but look on from morning to night
26-495-0040_1743-142912-0013.wav,this hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no getting at the lord mayor's door without exceeding difficulty there were such pressing and crowding there
26-495-0042_1502-122619-0059.wav,now as there had none died in the city for all this time my lord mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all those who lived in the ninety seven parishes and to those within the liberties too
26-495-0043_8580-287363-0009.wav,this hurry i say continued some weeks that is to say all the month of may and june and the more because it was rumoured that an order of the government was to be issued out
26-495-0045_5703-47198-0046.wav,concerning my own case and how i should dispose of myself that is to say whether i should resolve to stay in london or shut up my house and flee as many of my neighbours did i have set this particular down
26-495-0047_307-127539-0027.wav,to note what became of me i had two important things before me
26-495-0051_2159-179157-0024.wav,but i had a family of servants whom i kept at my business had a house shop and warehouses filled with goods and in short to leave them all as things in such a case must be left that is to say
26-495-0052_4680-16041-0040.wav,without any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them had been to hazard the loss not only of my trade but of my goods and indeed of all i had in the world i had an elder brother
26-495-0053_1898-145715-0018.wav,at the same time in london and not many years before come over from portugal and advising with him his answer was in three words
26-495-0054_2092-145706-0076.wav,that the best preparation for the plague was to run away from it as to my argument of losing my trade my goods or debts he quite confuted me he told me the same thing which
26-495-0056_27-124992-0053.wav,i say as many did because several did so at last especially those who had been in the armies in the war which had not been many years past and i must needs say that speaking of second causes
26-495-0059_3214-167606-0007.wav,so i was put off for that time and one way or other i always found that to appoint to go away was always crossed by some accident or other so as to disappoint and put it off again
26-495-0065_5463-39173-0013.wav,flying from god and that he could cause his justice to overtake me when and where he thought fit these thoughts quite turned my resolutions again and when i came to discourse with my brother again
26-495-0067_8609-262281-0016.wav,my brother though a very religious man himself laughed at all i had suggested about its being an intimation from heaven and told me several stories of such foolhardy people as he called them
26-495-0069_311-124404-0024.wav,i ought to acquiesce in the direction of him who having been my maker had an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me and that then there had been
26-495-0070_196-122159-0012.wav,only because i could not hire a horse to go or my fellow was run away that was to attend me was ridiculous since at the time i had my health and limbs and other servants and might
26-495-0075_2384-152900-0003.wav,and as i had already prepared everything as well as i could as to my business and whom to entrust my affairs with i had little to do but to resolve i went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind
26-495-0077_730-359-0035.wav,what was my duty to do and i stated the arguments with which my brother had pressed me to go into the country and i set against them the strong impressions which i had on my mind for staying the visible call i seemed to have
26-495-0082_374-180299-0042.wav,in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust
26-495-0083_3168-173565-0040.wav,because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
26-495-0086_8630-305213-0044.wav,the woman being taken ill with whom i had intended to entrust my house and all my affairs
26-495-0090_3526-176653-0050.wav,sweated a little and was much refreshed the apprehensions of its being the infection went also quite away with my illness and i went about my business as usual
26-496-0001_4014-186176-0008.wav,for the city that is to say within the walls was indifferently healthy still nor was it got then very much over the water into southwark
26-496-0002_6454-120342-0021.wav,of all distempers whereof it might be supposed above six hundred died of the plague yet there was but twenty eight in the whole city within the walls and but nineteen in southwark
26-496-0003_3112-9555-0025.wav,but we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out parishes which being very populous and fuller also of poor the distemper found more to prey upon than in the city
26-496-0004_198-126831-0009.wav,yet there died no more of the plague on the whole southwark side of the water than sixteen but this face of things soon changed
26-496-0005_2893-139322-0031.wav,and it began to thicken in cripplegate parish especially and in clarkenwell so that by the second week in august cripplegate parish alone buried eight hundred eighty six and clarkenwell
26-496-0008_3699-47246-0016.wav,that any should have hearts so hardened in the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal yet certain it is that all sorts of villainies and even levities and debaucheries
26-496-0009_4088-158077-0009.wav,were then practised in the town as openly as ever i will not say quite as frequently because the numbers of people were many ways lessened but the city itself began now to be visited too
26-496-0015_3879-173592-0014.wav,because as i suppose they would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses or
26-496-0023_6147-34607-0030.wav,all the ruined families of the royal party flocked hither all the old soldiers set up trades here and abundance of families settled here again
26-496-0024_2391-145015-0113.wav,to london i often thought that as jerusalem was besieged by the romans when the jews were assembled together to celebrate the passover by which means an incredible number of people were surprised there
26-496-0025_1363-135842-0048.wav,as this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay court made a great trade in the city especially in everything that belonged to fashion and finery
27-123349-0003_3436-172162-0032.wav,and he was forced to promise that even in the field except in the case of a surprise he would do nothing without the assent of a council of war monmouth was to command in england his soft mind had as usual
27-123349-0006_4680-16042-0008.wav,encouraging messages reached him in quick succession from london he was assured that the violence and injustice with which the elections had been carried on had driven the nation mad
27-123349-0007_8629-261139-0036.wav,that the prudence of the leading whigs had with difficulty prevented a sanguinary outbreak on the day of the coronation and that all the great lords who had supported the exclusion bill were impatient to rally round him
27-123349-0011_4406-16883-0037.wav,should accompany argyle to scotland and that fletcher should go with monmouth to england fletcher from the beginning had augured ill of the enterprise but his chivalrous spirit would not suffer him to decline a risk which his friends seemed eager to encounter
27-123349-0012_6880-216547-0031.wav,when grey repeated with approbation what wildman had said about richmond and richard the well read and thoughtful scot justly remarked that there was a great difference between the fifteenth century and the seventeenth
27-123349-0013_1455-134435-0047.wav,richmond was assured of the support of barons each of whom could bring an army of feudal retainers into the field
27-123349-0015_1081-125237-0015.wav,but his intellect and his temper preserved him from the violence of a partisan he had lived on confidential terms with shaftesbury and had thus incurred the displeasure of the court locke's prudence had however
27-123349-0016_4160-11549-0035.wav,been such that it would have been to little purpose to bring him even before the corrupt and partial tribunals of that age in one point however he was vulnerable he was a student of christ church in the university of oxford
27-123349-0019_5049-25947-0021.wav,that never man was so complete a master of his tongue and of his passions when it was found that treachery could do nothing arbitrary power was used after vainly trying to inveigle locke into a fault
27-123349-0023_374-180298-0027.wav,but it was apprehended that argyle would shortly appear in arms among his clansmen a proclamation was accordingly issued directing that scotland should be put into a state of defence the militia was ordered to be in readiness
27-123349-0025_1737-148989-0036.wav,and at the head of a great body of his followers
27-123349-0027_4640-19189-0033.wav,the king said that he had received from unquestionable sources intelligence of designs which were forming against the throne by his banished subjects in holland some of the exiles were cutthroats
27-123349-0030_5561-39621-0022.wav,were at this time most desirous that the hospitality of their country

307-127540-0017_1898-145724-0010.wav,and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for god's sake
307-127540-0019_1116-132851-0023.wav,after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance that was at least the end of that
307-127540-0020_1235-135883-0030.wav,and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand
307-127540-0025_4481-17499-0026.wav,silver was gone the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago
307-127540-0026_6563-285357-0006.wav,that man with the one leg had stayed aboard but this was not all the sea cook had not gone empty handed he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin
307-127540-0028_254-12312-0008.wav,well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mister blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort five men only of those who had sailed returned with her

311-124404-0002_1737-142397-0010.wav,i have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which i have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of god and of the soul
311-124404-0004_8465-246940-0031.wav,to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner
311-124404-0006_7517-100442-0024.wav,but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade
311-124404-0008_248-130652-0022.wav,to take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed stars since light almost wholly proceeds from them on the heavens since they transmit it on the planets comets and earth since they reflect it and particularly
311-124404-0010_8095-274346-0050.wav,further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned
311-124404-0013_5104-33407-0026.wav,and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established on this supposition i in the first place described this matter
311-124404-0015_3168-173564-0019.wav,for i even expressly supposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are so debated in the schools nor in general anything the knowledge of which is not so natural to our minds
311-124404-0017_5339-14134-0074.wav,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way
311-124404-0020_3983-5371-0058.wav,and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth to this i likewise added much respecting the substance the situation the motions
311-124404-0021_8051-118101-0000.wav,and all the different qualities of these heavens and stars so that i thought i had said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in the heavens or stars of our system that must not or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which i described
311-124404-0025_3436-172162-0007.wav,i knew nothing except fire which produces light i spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature the manner of its production and support and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light and light without heat
311-124404-0030_87-121553-0039.wav,but this is certain and an opinion commonly received among theologians that the action by which he now sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it
311-124404-0032_6476-57446-0048.wav,it may be believed without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone things purely material might in course of time
311-124404-0036_7367-86737-0086.wav,of the same matter with that i had described and at first placed in it no rational soul nor any other principle in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light
311-124404-0038_125-121124-0052.wav,as consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently
311-124404-0043_5867-48852-0014.wav,and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tubes viz the hollow vein vena cava
311-124404-0044_8630-305213-0040.wav,which is the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately so denominated
311-124404-0046_3235-28452-0013.wav,two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs
311-124404-0050_328-129766-0046.wav,which arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former readily permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity and in like manner
311-124404-0051_4859-22176-0013.wav,two others at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but preclude its return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart
311-124404-0053_1034-121119-0037.wav,whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture
311-124404-0054_8975-270782-0063.wav,and there form as it were two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body
311-124404-0056_2289-152254-0004.wav,for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood
311-124404-0060_7059-77897-0002.wav,of the two vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels through which they pass out
311-124404-0062_8088-284756-0107.wav,and the six small valves close and the five of the hollow

311-124404-0065_6880-216547-0005.wav,it thence happens that their motion is the contrary of that of the heart and that when it expands they contract but lest those who are ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish
311-124404-0066_3879-174923-0032.wav,true reasons from mere verisimilitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily
311-124404-0069_6181-216552-0102.wav,and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins
311-124404-0074_3436-172162-0051.wav,to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins there must of necessity
311-124404-0075_3214-167606-0004.wav,which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut
311-124404-0079_3436-172162-0038.wav,and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart
311-124404-0080_909-131045-0026.wav,in parts more remote from it in the next place
311-124404-0081_1334-135589-0028.wav,sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins and why should the left cavity of the heart
311-124404-0082_125-121124-0011.wav,and the arterial vein were it not that the blood of the venous artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and rarefies more readily and in a higher degree
311-124404-0084_229-130880-0011.wav,and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb
311-124404-0085_8051-119902-0021.wav,when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times in a day
311-124404-0086_5688-41232-0051.wav,and the production of the different humors of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being rarefied passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive
311-124404-0089_8238-274553-0065.wav,is the generation of the animal spirits which are like a very subtle wind or rather a very pure and vivid flame which
311-124404-0090_1970-26100-0030.wav,ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain thence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles and gives motion to all the members so that to account for other parts of the blood which as most agitated and penetrating
311-124404-0091_374-180298-0032.wav,proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart
311-124404-0092_1898-145724-0033.wav,in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point
311-124404-0096_198-209-0029.wav,waking sleep and dreams how light sounds odors tastes heat and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means of the senses how hunger
311-124404-0099_3879-174923-0048.wav,to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata or moving machines fabricated by human industry and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones
311-124404-0100_3947-13260-0044.wav,muscles nerves arteries veins and other parts that are found in the body of each animal such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of god which is incomparably better arranged
311-124404-0105_32-21631-0017.wav,appositely to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us
311-124404-0106_3983-5371-0021.wav,these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient
311-124404-0109_27-123349-0008.wav,and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak
311-124404-0111_5463-39174-0034.wav,should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack brained unless the soul of brutes
311-124404-0112_4137-11701-0013.wav,and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brutes speak although we do not understand their language
311-124404-0113_2007-132570-0043.wav,since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows
311-124404-0116_7226-86965-0040.wav,can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter
311-124404-0117_8609-283227-0018.wav,as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members
311-124404-0118_289-121665-0036.wav,but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man

322-124146-0028_7190-90542-0060.wav,elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte
322-124146-0034_481-123719-0035.wav,without having paid yourself and mister bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf
322-124146-0036_4898-20016-0007.wav,i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself
322-124147-0004_27-123349-0035.wav,after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mister wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town
322-124147-0005_4214-7146-0041.wav,and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody
322-124147-0006_1926-147987-0012.wav,to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed i found said he as the time drew near
322-124147-0011_4898-20016-0040.wav,but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs
322-124147-0013_1898-145720-0003.wav,to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mister bingley will not be detained in london by them

322-124147-0016_8088-284756-0028.wav,as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter
322-124147-0019_8629-261140-0010.wav,and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself
322-124147-0020_2911-15045-0019.wav,is heightened into something still more interesting
322-124147-0021_307-127539-0014.wav,he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister's partiality is not misleading me i think
322-124147-0022_226-131533-0003.wav,when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane

322-124147-0026_7178-34644-0044.wav,for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy
322-124147-0028_7635-105409-0006.wav,no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mister darcy for herself
322-124147-0030_441-130108-0038.wav,in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine

322-124147-0033_1088-129236-0028.wav,is that she is deceiving herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means
322-124147-0034_8419-293473-0013.wav,even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth
322-124147-0035_2391-145015-0096.wav,and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him
322-124147-0039_3857-182315-0030.wav,and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that missus bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern
322-124147-0040_7078-271888-0100.wav,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length
322-124147-0042_198-126831-0005.wav,the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mister collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her
322-124147-0043_2910-131096-0024.wav,it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful
322-124147-0044_4297-13006-0012.wav,and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of
322-124147-0046_7178-34644-0043.wav,but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet
322-124147-0047_118-47824-0044.wav,he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design
322-124147-0050_2182-150130-0029.wav,in as short a time as mister collins's long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house
322-124147-0052_7067-76047-0042.wav,who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent
322-124147-0054_4397-15678-0015.wav,and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mister collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at saint james's
322-124147-0056_3983-5331-0024.wav,and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it
322-124147-0057_6415-100596-0007.wav,her reflections were in general satisfactory mister collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary
322-124147-0060_4051-11218-0053.wav,without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet
322-124147-0061_1235-135883-0017.wav,whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt
322-124147-0062_2952-410-0001.wav,she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mister collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family

322-124147-0072_8238-274553-0000.wav,not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew
322-124147-0074_200-124139-0005.wav,related the event of the day before the possibility of mister collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him
322-124147-0078_2289-152254-0024.wav,she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza
322-124147-0079_8419-293469-0010.wav,and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mister collins was wishing to marry you
322-124147-0081_6925-80680-0052.wav,i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause
322-124147-0082_2416-152139-0038.wav,the strangeness of mister collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own
328-129766-0004_5778-12761-0015.wav,got some refreshment on shore and put to sea again though we met with very bad weather again in which the ship sprung her mainmast as they called it for i knew not what they meant but we got at last into milford haven in wales
328-129766-0012_6925-80680-0037.wav,i took the diversion of going to the bath for as i was still far from being old so my humour which was always gay continued so to an extreme and being now as it were a woman of fortune though i was a woman without a fortune
328-129766-0020_4853-29413-0026.wav,for though i had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the bath for his diversion
328-129766-0021_6563-63821-0027.wav,as it might be called i had resisted some casual offers of gallantry and had managed that way well enough i was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it and i had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which i wanted
328-129766-0027_5456-62043-0037.wav,here i say i passed the winter as heavily as i had passed the autumn cheerfully
328-129766-0028_3857-180923-0002.wav,of what lay hardest upon my mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea i told her also that i had a mother and a brother in virginia in good circumstances
328-129766-0029_3242-8112-0037.wav,and as i had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition and the great loss i had received
328-129766-0030_5808-48608-0022.wav,so i did not fail to let my new friend know that i expected a supply from thence and so indeed i did and as the ships went from bristol to york river in virginia and back again generally in less time from london
328-129766-0032_4051-11218-0051.wav,and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for lodging during the winter i paid nothing at all
328-129766-0034_311-124404-0070.wav,the winter before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house
328-129766-0035_8098-278252-0033.wav,letting him know that i was still with her but she denied it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same in a word this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation
328-129766-0038_441-130108-0025.wav,and that i waited at bath till the next virginia fleet should arrive by which i expected considerable effects i understood by him and by others of him that he had a wife but that the lady was distempered in her head and was under the conduct
328-129766-0040_696-93314-0020.wav,from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was my landlady who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions gave me an advantageous character of him
328-129766-0047_6078-54007-0003.wav,which he was sorry for assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity but merely to assist me if there was any occasion but since i
328-129766-0049_200-126784-0003.wav,adding that i should always find i had a true friend though perhaps i was afraid to trust him i omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged to let him know that i had a due sense of his kindness
328-129766-0050_1088-129236-0003.wav,and indeed from that time i did not appear so much reserved to him as i had done before though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides but how free soever our conversation was i could not arrive to that sort of freedom
328-129766-0053_3723-171631-0010.wav,oh widow says she i have bad news to tell you this morning what is that said i are the virginia ships taken by the french for that was my fear no no says she
328-129766-0054_2092-145706-0047.wav,but the man you sent to bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he has brought none now i could by no means like her project
328-129766-0055_2910-131096-0082.wav,which indeed he did not want and i clearly saw that i should lose nothing by being backward to ask so i took her up short
328-129766-0057_1502-122619-0091.wav,as she did at first as well as i taking it as i fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself again the next morning we talked of it again when i found he was fully satisfied
328-129766-0058_5808-48608-0007.wav,and smiling said he hoped i would not want money and not tell him of it and that i had promised him otherwise i told him i had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady's talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with
328-129766-0059_254-145458-0021.wav,but i supposed she wanted what i owed her which was about eight guineas which i had resolved to give her and had accordingly
328-129766-0060_460-172357-0017.wav,he was in a might good humour when he heard me say i had paid her and it went off into some other discourse at that time but the next morning he having heard me up about my room before him he called to me and i answering he asked me to come into his chamber
328-129766-0061_2764-36616-0035.wav,for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment after some very kind expressions he asked me if i would be very honest to him and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me
328-129766-0065_150-126112-0017.wav,where i had about six guineas more and some silver and threw it all down upon the bed and told him there was all my wealth honestly to a shilling he looked a little at it but did not tell it
328-129766-0066_3879-174923-0043.wav,and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key and bade me open a little walnut tree box he had upon the table and bring him such a drawer which i did in which drawer there was a great deal of money in gold i believe near two hundred guineas
328-129766-0067_5789-57195-0024.wav,but i knew not how much he took the drawer and taking my hand made me put it in and take a whole handful i was backward at that but he held my hand hard in his hand
328-129766-0069_2391-145015-0049.wav,and carry it all home into my own chamber i relate this story the more particularly because of the good humour there was in it and to show the temper with which we conversed
328-129766-0071_4406-16882-0038.wav,for i loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes i told him i must housewife the money he had lent me or else i should not be able to pay him again he then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me and knew my circumstances
328-129766-0072_87-121553-0081.wav,and that he thought i had merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as i had done after this he made me take a maid and keep house
328-129766-0073_8975-270782-0083.wav,which i did very willingly believing as it appeared that i should lose nothing by it nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too we had lived thus near three months when
328-129766-0075_4788-91208-0001.wav,i was not very easy in that proposal not knowing what posture i was to live in there or how he might use me but while this was in debate
328-129766-0077_2182-150130-0034.wav,he had left all his money and other things of value with me and what to do with them i did not know but i secured them as well as i could and locked up the lodgings and went to him where i found him very ill indeed however i persuaded him to be carried
328-129766-0084_5339-14134-0064.wav,of attending him night and day when he was sick there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us oh that it had been so to the last after some time he gathered strength and grew well apace
328-129766-0085_4267-78186-0001.wav,and i would have removed my pallet bed but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him and then i removed to my own chamber
328-129766-0086_125-121124-0029.wav,and when he grew quite well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care and as he called it for hazarding my life to save his and now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection for me
328-129766-0088_2092-145706-0000.wav,as he would defend it if i was assaulted by a ravisher i believed him and told him i did so but this did not satisfy him he would he said
328-129766-0091_1246-124548-0000.wav,and coming into that room said very frankly to him sir it is none of my business to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no
328-129766-0092_1040-133433-0004.wav,which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds well says my friend very readily these beds will do and as for the rest we are too near akin to lie together though we may lodge near one another
328-129766-0093_1867-148436-0030.wav,he decently went out of the room till i was in bed and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room but lay there talking to me a great while at last repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me and not offer me the least injury
328-129766-0095_1970-26100-0003.wav,if he had not made those promises at all so after a little struggle as i said i lay still and let him come to bed when he was there he took me in his arms and so i lay all night with him but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me
328-129766-0098_1578-140045-0003.wav,that though i was to him to most agreeable woman in the world yet because he loved me he could not injure me
332-128985-0000_1088-134315-0032.wav,we will pass to the consideration of a regular out and out pirate one from whose mast head would have floated the black flag with its skull and cross bones if that emblematic piece of bunting had been in use by the pirates of the period
332-128985-0001_8088-284756-0010.wav,and his own was unknown and the brazilian because he was born in brazil though of dutch parents unlike most of his fellow practitioners he did not gradually become a pirate from his early youth
332-128985-0002_89-218-0007.wav,he never had an intention of being anything else as soon as he grew to be a man he became a bloody buccaneer and at the first opportunity he joined a pirate crew and had made but a few voyages when it was perceived by his companions
332-128985-0003_6531-61334-0072.wav,that he was destined to become a most remarkable sea robber he was offered the command of a ship with a well armed crew of marine savages
332-128985-0004_118-124588-0018.wav,he fell in with a spanish ship loaded with silver bullion having captured this he sailed with his prize to jamaica which was one of the great resorts of the english buccaneers there his success delighted the community
332-128985-0005_6476-57446-0007.wav,his talents for the conduct of great piratical operations soon became apparent and he was generally acknowledged as the head pirate of the west indies he was now looked upon as a hero even by those colonists
332-128985-0006_7859-102519-0007.wav,who had no sympathy with pirates and as for esquemeling he simply worshipped the great brazilian desperado if he had been writing the life and times of alexander the great julius caesar or mister gladstone
332-128985-0007_5652-39938-0054.wav,he could not have been more enthusiastic in his praises and as in the arabian nights the roc is described as the greatest of birds so in the eyes of the buccaneer biographer this roc was the greatest of pirates
332-128985-0008_1098-133695-0006.wav,that roc now became famous the better he became known the more general was the fear and respect felt for him and we are told that the mothers of the islands used to put their children to sleep by threatening them with the terrible roc if they did not close their eyes
332-128985-0012_8312-279791-0022.wav,his eyebrows were enormously large and bushy and from under them he glared at his mundane surroundings he was not a man whose spirit could be quelled by looking him steadfastly in the eye it was his custom in the daytime to walk about
332-128985-0013_89-218-0056.wav,carrying a drawn cutlass resting easily upon his arm edge up very much as a fine gentleman carries his high silk hat and any one who should impertinently stare or endeavor to quell his high spirits in any other way
332-128985-0014_7302-86815-0002.wav,would probably have felt the edge of that cutlass descending rapidly through his physical organism he was a man who insisted upon being obeyed and if any one of his crew behaved improperly or was even found idle
332-128985-0018_6064-56168-0027.wav,that his visits to jamaica were looked forward to with any eager anticipations roc it may be said was not only a bloody pirate but a blooded one he was thoroughbred
332-128985-0019_32-21625-0009.wav,from the time he had been able to assert his individuality he had been a pirate and there was no reason to suppose that he would ever reform himself into anything else there were no extenuating circumstances in his case
332-128985-0020_1926-143879-0041.wav,in his nature there was no alloy nor moderation nor forbearance the appreciative esquemeling who might be called the boswell of the buccaneers could never have met his hero roc
332-128985-0021_8312-279790-0030.wav,when that bushy bearded pirate was running amuck in the streets but if he had it is not probable that his book would have been written he assures us that when roc was not drunk he was esteemed but at the same time feared
332-128985-0023_1992-141719-0044.wav,but in all the instances of ferocious enmity toward the spaniards there has been nothing to equal the feelings of roc the brazilian upon that subject his dislike to everything spanish arose he declared
332-128985-0027_26-495-0081.wav,he was cruising about campeachy without seeing any craft that was worth capturing
332-128985-0028_2989-138028-0054.wav,and find out whether or not there were any spanish vessels in the bay which were well laden and which were likely soon to come out so with a small boat filled with some of his trusty men he rowed quietly into the port to see what he could discover
332-128985-0029_3879-174923-0049.wav,and had sent that mild mannered observer into the harbor to investigate into the state of affairs
332-128985-0030_4397-15666-0020.wav,but he chose to go himself and he came to grief no sooner did the people on the ships lying in the harbor behold a boat approaching with a big browed broad jawed mariner sitting in the stern
332-128985-0031_426-122822-0014.wav,and with a good many more broad backed hairy mariners than were necessary pulling at the oars than they gave the alarm
332-128985-0035_118-47824-0055.wav,during the time that preparations were going on for making examples of these impertinent pirates
332-128985-0036_4014-186179-0035.wav,this was a branch of the business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient if he could not get himself out of scrapes he could not expect to be successful in this case there was no chance of cutting down sentinels
332-128985-0037_7148-59157-0005.wav,or jumping overboard with a couple of wine jars for a life preserver or of doing any of those ordinary things which pirates were in the habit of doing when escaping from their captors
332-128985-0038_4680-16041-0001.wav,inside of a fortress and if they escaped from this they would find themselves unarmed in the midst of a body of spanish soldiers their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them now
332-128985-0039_4267-72637-0015.wav,and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any roc had plenty of wit and he used it well there was a slave probably not a negro nor a native
332-128985-0041_201-127786-0067.wav,he would give him money enough to buy his freedom and to return to his friends and this of course was a great inducement to the poor fellow who may have been an englishman or a frenchman in good circumstances at home the slave agreed to the proposals
332-128985-0043_8226-274369-0028.wav,when he was coming into the bay roc had noticed a large french vessel that was lying at some distance from the town
332-128985-0046_5456-62014-0009.wav,or upon the town of campeachy should be taken as soon as possible after he should hear of any injury that might be inflicted upon the unfortunate men who were then lying imprisoned in the fortress when the slave came back to roc
332-128985-0050_8747-293952-0032.wav,having fulfilled his mission he departed and when seen again he was the same servant whose business it was to carry food to the prisoners the governor read the letter with a disquieted mind
332-128985-0055_5789-57195-0018.wav,to throw away the cub and walk off as though he had no idea there were any bears in that forest would be the inclination of a man so situated and to get rid of the great pirate without provoking the vengeance of his friends
332-128985-0059_2843-152918-0079.wav,there is no doubt that our buccaneers would have much preferred to have been put on board the french vessel but as the spanish governor had started his prisoners on the road to reform he did not wish to throw them into the way of temptation
332-128985-0060_6385-34669-0017.wav,by allowing them to associate with such wicked companions as frenchmen and roc made no suggestion of the kind knowing very well how greatly astonished the french captain would be if the governor were to communicate with him on the subject
332-128985-0061_6848-252323-0011.wav,on the voyage to spain roc was on his good behavior and he was a man who knew how to behave very well when it was absolutely necessary no doubt there must have been many dull days on board ship
332-128985-0064_6836-76549-0027.wav,how to shoot fish with bow and arrows and on this voyage across the atlantic he occupied all his spare time in sitting in the rigging and shooting the fish which disported themselves about the vessel
332-128985-0068_1183-133255-0003.wav,but as soon as they could manage it they sailed back to the west indies and eventually found themselves in jamaica
332-128985-0070_8609-262281-0034.wav,and with a large company of buccaneers he actually set out to take a town having lost everything he possessed and having passed such a long time without any employment more profitable than that of shooting fish with a bow and arrows
332-128985-0071_3526-176651-0012.wav,our doughty pirate now desired to make a grand strike and if he could take a town and pillage it of everything valuable it contained he would make a very good fortune in a very short time and might retire if he chose
332-128985-0073_6529-62556-0007.wav,in yucatan and although this was a bold and rash undertaking the two pirates were bold and rash enough for anything roc had been a prisoner in merida and on account of his knowledge of the town he believed that he and his followers could land upon the coast
332-128985-0077_426-122822-0009.wav,in a marine combat it is seldom that a party of boarders is attacked in the rear by the enemy although on land such methods of warfare may always be expected
332-128985-0079_201-127786-0017.wav,tributor and a great many of the pirates were killed or taken and roc the brazilian had a terrible fall this most memorable fall occurred in the estimation of john esquemeling

332-128985-0087_226-131532-0021.wav,but which are necessary to make up the true character of a pirate the historian john seems to have been very much cut up by the manner in which his favorite hero had rounded off his piratical career
332-128985-0088_233-134440-0041.wav,and after that he entirely dropped roc from his chronicles

374-180298-0012_587-41619-0023.wav,and all the simplicity of its developments i realized then that as nothing in the world would make me forget my mistress it was needful for me to find some way of meeting the expenses into which she drew me then too

887-123289-0012_8014-280382-0012.wav,i feel pleased at the thought that it is sure not to be shut against us but then we shall have to refit the raft of course then as to provisions have we enough to last
887-123289-0015_5703-47198-0005.wav,on my arrival on the shore i found hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good order my uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude this man with almost superhuman devotion
887-123289-0016_196-122152-0010.wav,and had saved the most precious of the articles at the risk of his life not that we had suffered no losses for instance our firearms but we might do without them our stock of powder had remained uninjured
887-123289-0019_4859-22176-0008.wav,such high spirits as these were rather too strong but where is the compass i asked here it is upon this rock in perfect condition as well as the thermometers and the chronometer the hunter is a splendid fellow
887-123289-0020_3112-9554-0021.wav,there was no denying it we had all our instruments as for tools and appliances there they all lay on the ground ladders ropes picks spades et cetera still there was the question of provisions to be settled and i asked
887-123289-0021_8051-295385-0028.wav,how are we off for provisions the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore in a perfect state of preservation for the most part the sea had spared them and what with biscuits salt meat spirits and salt fish
887-123289-0023_1116-137572-0015.wav,i ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's ways yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me now said he
887-123289-0026_3830-12535-0009.wav,i followed him to a headland after he had given his instructions to the hunter there preserved meat biscuit and tea made us an excellent meal one of the best i ever remember hunger the fresh air the calm quiet weather
887-123289-0028_8108-274318-0034.wav,yes it is difficult he said to calculate exactly perhaps even impossible since during these three stormy days i have been unable to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft but still we may get an approximation
887-123289-0030_2092-145706-0060.wav,let it be axel island then we had cleared two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were six hundred leagues from iceland very well answered my uncle let us start from that point and count four days storm
887-123289-0032_4788-294466-0003.wav,that is a good long way my friend but whether we are under turkey or the atlantic depends very much upon the question
887-123289-0033_8095-274346-0045.wav,perhaps we have deviated no i think not
887-123289-0034_2911-7601-0038.wav,well replied my uncle we may easily ascertain this by consulting the compass let us go and see what it says the professor moved towards the rock upon which hans had laid down the instruments
887-123289-0037_5808-54425-0042.wav,and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery what is the matter i asked
887-123289-0038_625-132112-0037.wav,an exclamation of astonishment burst from me the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea i shook the box examined it again
887-123290-0001_19-227-0020.wav,shall fire air and water make a combined attack against me well they shall know what a determined man can do i will not yield i will not stir a single foot backwards and it will be seen whether man or nature is to have the upper hand
887-123290-0002_78-369-0017.wav,erect upon the rock angry and threatening otto liedenbrock was a rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce achilles defying the lightning but i thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism
887-123290-0003_211-122425-0009.wav,just listen to me i said firmly ambition must have a limit somewhere we cannot perform impossibilities we are not at all fit for another sea voyage who would dream of undertaking a voyage of five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks
887-123290-0004_89-219-0027.wav,with a blanket in rags for a sail a stick for a mast and fierce winds in our teeth we cannot steer we shall be buffeted by the tempests and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time
887-123290-0006_730-358-0058.wav,to the raft he shouted such was his only reply it was no use for me to entreat supplicate get angry or do anything else in the way of opposition
887-123290-0007_8088-284756-0101.wav,hans was finishing the repairs of the raft one would have thought that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions with a few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel
887-123290-0008_150-126107-0009.wav,a sail already hung from the new mast and the wind was playing in its waving folds the professor said a few words to the guide and immediately he put everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure
887-123290-0010_3879-174923-0026.wav,the icelander seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget and deny himself i could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised as it were to his master my only course was to proceed
887-123290-0011_289-121665-0034.wav,i was therefore going with as much resignation as i could find to resume my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle laid his hand upon my shoulder we shall not sail until to morrow he said
887-123290-0012_302-123504-0009.wav,i will not leave it until i have examined it to understand what followed it must be borne in mind that
887-123290-0015_1502-122619-0034.wav,i also saw immense carapaces more than fifteen feet in diameter
887-123290-0017_730-358-0006.wav,the waves had left manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone this might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe but in my opinion
887-123290-0018_7302-86814-0017.wav,this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within the interior of the earth and it certainly had its origin in the waters of the ocean overhead which had made their way hither through some fissure yet
887-123290-0022_6836-61804-0002.wav,wherever he saw a hole he always wanted to know the depth of it to him this was important we had traversed the shores of the liedenbrock sea for a mile when we observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil it seemed upset contorted

887-123291-0005_3830-12531-0029.wav,therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent
887-123291-0006_8468-294887-0023.wav,and agreeing in that with cuvier he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period my uncle liedenbrock along with the great body of the geologists had maintained his ground disputed and argued until

887-123291-0029_6000-55211-0041.wav,it is not a mere skeleton it is an entire body
887-123291-0035_3982-182255-0008.wav,it is nearly ninety degrees but i will go further in my deductions and i will affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the japhetic race which has since spread from the indies to the atlantic don't smile gentlemen nobody was smiling
887-123291-0036_3723-171631-0030.wav,but the learned professor was frequently disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities yes he pursued with animation this is a fossil man the contemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre
887-123291-0038_8609-283227-0015.wav,considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth the long continued cooling of the globe produced chasms fissures clefts and faults into which very probably portions of the upper earth may have fallen

887-123291-0041_1963-147036-0016.wav,in fact it was a wonderful spectacle that of these generations of men and animals commingled in a common cemetery then one very serious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest
909-131041-0000_6437-66173-0038.wav,the mode of appointment of the chief magistrate of the united states is almost the only part of the system of any consequence which has escaped without severe censure or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents
909-131041-0002_32-21631-0007.wav,and hesitate not to affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect it is at least excellent
909-131041-0003_226-131532-0029.wav,but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose and at the particular conjuncture it was equally desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station
909-131041-0004_5456-58161-0020.wav,and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice a small number of persons
909-131041-0006_322-124146-0037.wav,but the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration promise an effectual security against this mischief the choice of several to form an intermediate body of electors
909-131041-0011_3440-171009-0002.wav,how could they better gratify this than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union but the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention

909-131041-0016_8629-261140-0020.wav,the business of corruption when it is to embrace so considerable a number of men requires time as well as means nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them dispersed as they would be over thirteen states
909-131041-0017_1867-148436-0020.wav,in any combinations founded upon motives which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt might yet be of a nature to mislead them from their duty
909-131041-0019_1081-125237-0074.wav,this advantage will also be secured by making his re election to depend on a special body of representatives deputed by the society for the single purpose of making the important choice all these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the convention
909-131041-0020_8108-280354-0030.wav,which is that the people of each state shall choose a number of persons as electors equal to the number of senators and representatives of such state in the national government who shall assemble within the state and vote for some fit person as president
909-131041-0021_3168-173565-0005.wav,and the person who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the president but as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre in one man and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive
909-131041-0023_302-123516-0016.wav,the process of election affords a moral certainty that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications talents for low intrigue
909-131041-0024_5049-25947-0084.wav,and the little arts of popularity may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single state but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole union

909-131044-0001_3857-182315-0002.wav,and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his auspices with regard to the first it must be evident that the longer the duration in office the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an advantage
909-131044-0002_3947-13260-0035.wav,it is a general principle of human nature that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it
909-131044-0004_4014-186175-0000.wav,the inference from it is that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate under a consciousness that in a very short time he must lay down his office will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity
909-131044-0005_7113-86041-0069.wav,from the independent exertion of his powers or from encountering the ill humors however transient which may happen to prevail either in a considerable part of the society itself or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body

909-131044-0014_78-369-0046.wav,but however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the people we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the legislature
909-131044-0021_4481-17499-0044.wav,they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the constitution it may perhaps be asked how the shortness of the duration in office
909-131044-0022_1034-121119-0076.wav,can affect the independence of the executive on the legislature unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other one answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked
909-131044-0025_460-172359-0092.wav,would not for that reason be preferable to a longer period which was at the same time too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the magistrate it cannot be affirmed that a duration of four years or any other limited duration

909-131045-0036_1898-145715-0012.wav,but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other

911-128684-0007_298-126791-0014.wav,because i had to be so brief i now return to the subject because i believe that so far from invalidating my general thesis these phenomena when properly analyzed afford it powerful support
911-128684-0008_3374-298032-0003.wav,the central point of the pure experience theory is that outer and inner are names for two groups into which we sort experiences according to the way in which they act upon their neighbors
911-128684-0009_1970-10594-0042.wav,any one content such as hard let us say can be assigned to either group in the outer group it is strong it acts energetically and aggressively
911-128684-0011_2196-170151-0014.wav,in the mind on the contrary the hard thing is nowhere in particular it dents nothing it suffuses through its mental neighbors as it were and interpenetrates them
911-128684-0014_5867-48852-0043.wav,is a natural consequence of the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come to her offspring a tigress is tender but cruel to every other living thing
911-128684-0017_229-130880-0092.wav,it is only towards certain specific groups of associates that the physical energies as we call them of a content are put forth in another group it may be quite inert
911-128684-0018_298-126791-0032.wav,it is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only alternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or complete inertness
911-128684-0020_103-1241-0025.wav,but the universe we live in is more chaotic than this and there is room in it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences of our emotions and appreciative perceptions
911-128684-0022_1263-141777-0026.wav,that their ambiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that subjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is aboriginally made of but of its classification
911-128684-0023_6019-3185-0045.wav,classifications depend on our temporary purposes for certain purposes it is convenient to take things in one set of relations
911-128684-0026_6209-34601-0025.wav,thus would these experiences so far from being an obstacle to the pure experience philosophy serve as an excellent corroboration of its truth first of all then it is a mistake to say
911-128684-0027_7190-90542-0064.wav,with the objectors whom i began by citing that anger love and fear are affections purely of the mind
911-128684-0029_446-123501-0024.wav,and we are always free to speak of them in objective as well as in subjective terms we can say that we are aware of a painful place filling a certain bigness in our organism
911-128684-0030_6078-54013-0050.wav,or we can say that we are inwardly in a state of pain all our adjectives of worth are similarly ambiguous
911-128684-0034_4088-158077-0093.wav,we discover beauty just as we discover the physical properties of things training is needed to make us expert in either line single sensations also may be ambiguous shall we say
911-128684-0036_8609-283227-0041.wav,were we forbidden to project words primarily connoting our affections upon the objects by which the affections are aroused the man is really hateful the action really mean the situation really tragic
911-128684-0037_5867-48852-0070.wav,all in themselves and quite apart from our opinion we even go so far as to talk of a weary road a giddy height a jocund morning or a sullen sky
911-128684-0038_6880-216547-0054.wav,and the term indefinite while usually applied only to our apprehensions functions as a fundamental physical qualification of things in spencer's law of evolution

911-128684-0049_426-122819-0010.wav,or as rigorously physical facts so they remain equivocal and as the world goes their equivocality is one of their great conveniences

911-128684-0057_2817-142371-0028.wav,are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena of our own consciousness there are no activities or effects in nature for the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation
911-128684-0058_6925-80680-0080.wav,nature exhibits only changes which habitually coincide with one another
911-128684-0062_481-123720-0055.wav,turn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us we soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our interests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another
911-128684-0067_302-123523-0035.wav,the whole collection of our appreciative attributes has to be treated as falling outside of it if we mean by physical nature whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies
911-128684-0069_4362-15663-0080.wav,they are not inert as regards that part of physical nature which our own skin covers it is those very appreciative attributes of things their dangerousness beauty rarity utility et cetera
911-128684-0072_7517-100437-0033.wav,the interesting aspects of things are thus not wholly inert physically though they be active only in these small corners of physical nature which our bodies occupy
911-128684-0073_5688-41232-0002.wav,that however is enough to save them from being classed as absolutely non objective the attempt if any one should make it to sort experiences into two absolutely discrete groups
911-128684-0074_7067-76047-0005.wav,with nothing but inertness in one of them and nothing but activities in the other would thus receive one check it would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively mental group
911-128684-0077_2843-152918-0043.wav,and the purposes they subserve by their affective values in short that their consecution in our several conscious streams as thoughts of ours is mainly ruled desire introduces them interest holds them
911-128684-0079_6848-252322-0001.wav,is the most natural thing in the world it would however be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which i cited at the outset were correct if physical and mental meant two different kinds of intrinsic nature
911-128684-0080_5867-48852-0019.wav,immediately intuitively and infallibly discernible and each fixed forever in whatever bit of experience it qualified one does not see how there could ever have arisen any room for doubt or ambiguity
911-128684-0081_2384-152900-0070.wav,but if on the contrary these words are words of sorting ambiguity is natural for then as soon as the relations of a thing are sufficiently various it can be sorted variously
911-128684-0083_163-121908-0006.wav,the sun caresses it and the zephyr wooes it as if it were a bed of roses so the disgustingness fails to operate within the realm of suns and breezes
911-128684-0085_4406-16882-0042.wav,and conversely of course we must treat it as non mental or as mental our body itself is the palmary instance of the ambiguous sometimes i treat my body purely as a part of outer nature
911-128684-0086_6078-54013-0075.wav,sometimes again i think of it as mine i sort it with the me and then certain local changes and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings its breathing is my thinking
911-128684-0090_5463-39174-0005.wav,it is their way of behaving towards each other their system of relations their function and all these things vary with the context in which we find it opportune to consider them i think i may conclude then
911-128684-0091_5049-25947-0078.wav,and i hope that my readers are now ready to conclude with me that the pretended spirituality of our emotions and of our attributes of value so far from proving an objection to the philosophy of pure experience does when rightly discussed and accounted for
911-130578-0000_3947-13260-0000.wav,and for this the village boys with whom he played used to quarrel with him saying fatherless orphan why do you cheat so one day he asked his mother why they called him that name and whether his father was really dead

911-130578-0009_6147-34605-0029.wav,but this only broke her teeth and made her mouth bleed so that the pain was worse than before then the boy jeered at her and said did you think grannie that you could bite my iron bow and arrows so saying he left her
911-130578-0014_150-126112-0008.wav,and they drank and went away then various kinds of birds came
911-130578-0016_669-129061-0061.wav,he put an arrow through it and it turned a somersault and fell over dead
911-130578-0019_6818-68772-0024.wav,and then whip the body with a meral twig and he will come to life so saying the stranger suddenly disappeared and the boy obeyed his instructions and behold his father sat up alive and rubbing his eyes said

1034-121119-0007_4160-11549-0032.wav,not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it

1355-39947-0003_1334-135589-0016.wav,one which is perhaps most often heard in popular circles results from an entire misunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed study of the processes involved it is claimed that suggestive power especially in the form of
1355-39947-0004_3112-9555-0030.wav,hypnotization may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent often this is coupled with telepathic fancies
1355-39947-0006_103-1240-0056.wav,the presuppositions of such a view are as we know now entirely absurd we know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism
1355-39947-0007_4788-294466-0029.wav,the imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will the story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public
1355-39947-0009_7402-90848-0032.wav,whole pamphlets have been written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations and requests to legislatures have been made in that spirit but the physician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the well known phenomena of the mental disease
1355-39947-0010_4853-27670-0007.wav,to be sure while no one can be hypnotized against his will many a person is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out the wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without willing that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own motives
1355-39947-0011_4406-16883-0017.wav,but if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life we should give up social life itself suggestion is given wherever men come in contact in itself it is neither good nor bad the good resolution and the bad one can be suggested
1355-39947-0012_7402-59171-0033.wav,the good example and the bad can be effective both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique certainly there are some persons who have a stronger influence than others on the imagination of those with whom they come in contact
1355-39947-0013_8629-261140-0039.wav,their expression awakens confidence their voice and their words reach deeper layers of the mind their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the antagonistic ideas
1355-39947-0014_4195-186236-0027.wav,but the chief difference lies after all in the different degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such impressions the easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict he may catch suggestions everywhere
1355-39947-0015_4397-15666-0021.wav,any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions what he needs is training in firmness the application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him
1355-39947-0018_8098-275181-0009.wav,no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question as soon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community it becomes our duty to bring the causal and the purposive view into harmony and it would be narrow and short sighted simply to
1355-39947-0019_8797-294123-0007.wav,draw the practical consequences of a naturalistic view of the mind without inquiring whether or not serious interests in the purposive sphere are injured if there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy it is the duty of the community to consider it
1355-39947-0020_6064-56168-0025.wav,this opposition argues as follows hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom whatever the patient may reach in the altered states is reached without his own effort while he is the passive receiver
1355-39947-0021_2764-36617-0025.wav,his achievement has therefore no moral value and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent it would be better
1355-39947-0022_5104-33407-0003.wav,if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined no one ought to take such arguments lightly the spirit which directs them is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for superficial goods
1355-39947-0023_5778-12761-0003.wav,no one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the
1355-39947-0027_8226-274371-0035.wav,you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend in proportion as you deprive him of the free control and exercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend
1355-39947-0029_5339-14133-0035.wav,but because it is in error as to the facts such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy
1355-39947-0032_5339-14133-0038.wav,but after a long experience i have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts on the contrary
1355-39947-0034_1363-139304-0007.wav,if again and again i hesitate to undertake new cases it is just because i have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses the joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients
1355-39947-0035_4088-158077-0061.wav,is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments to make a man fight where despair is inevitable and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers can certainly not be the moral demand
1355-39947-0038_405-130895-0001.wav,when that man left my laboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness you might well have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and pleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the dangerous desire for morphine
1355-39947-0040_39-121914-0034.wav,that is coming to anyone who is the user of opium or any of its alkaloids for the first few months i found great relief after every injection of morphine but soon i could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep i got was in the daytime
1355-39947-0043_8226-274371-0024.wav,three doses of three grains a day i took my hypodermic as directed but on the following day i lay on the bed too exhausted to get up even to get around the room and i could not eat

2514-149482-0049_6563-63821-0044.wav,it might move american nerves he had only heard of them before but in his recent tour he had caught them in the remarkable fact and there was now a moment or two when it came to him that he had perhaps and not in the way of an escape
2514-149482-0050_5789-70653-0015.wav,taken a lesson from them they quivered clearly they hummed and drummed they leaped and bounded in missus stringham's typical organism this lady striking him as before all things excited as in the native phrase keyed up
2514-149482-0056_39-121914-0025.wav,for all that was said much further than in the states it wouldn't be the first time he urged that they had taught the americans to appreciate especially when it was funny some native product
2514-149482-0057_6272-70168-0013.wav,but it might very well be that new york in having her to show hadn't been aware of its luck there were plenty of people who were nothing over there and yet were awfully taken up in england just as to make the balance right thank goodness
2514-149482-0058_3374-298025-0012.wav,they sometimes sent out beauties and celebrities who left the briton cold the briton's temperature in truth wasn't to be calculated a formulation of the matter that was not reached

2514-149482-0061_1235-135887-0022.wav,the weirdness in which milly's absence had left them deficient she made it indeed effective for him by suddenly addressing him you know nothing sir but not the least little bit about my friend
2514-149482-0063_6000-55211-0036.wav,but while doing so he defended himself i certainly don't know enormously much beyond her having been most kind to me in new york as a poor bewildered and newly landed alien
2514-149482-0064_1963-142776-0006.wav,and my having tremendously appreciated it to which he added he scarce knew why what had an immediate success remember missus stringham that you weren't then present ah there you are said kate with much gay expression
2514-149482-0066_2518-154826-0026.wav,it made the little woman he could see really lose her head she had more things in that head than any of them in any other unless perhaps it were kate whom he felt as indirectly watching him during this foolish passage
2514-149482-0068_1040-133433-0057.wav,really the beginning as the event was to show of something extraordinary it was even already a little the effect of this communion that missus stringham perceptibly faltered in her retort to missus lowder's joke
2514-149482-0069_412-126975-0028.wav,oh it's precisely my point that mister densher can't have had vast opportunities and then she smiled at him i wasn't away you know long it made everything in the oddest way in the world immediately right for him
2514-149482-0070_254-27760-0006.wav,and i wasn't there long either he positively saw with it that nothing for him so far as she was concerned would again be wrong she's beautiful but i don't say she's easy to know
2514-149482-0071_8770-295463-0003.wav,as if now to keep well with him he asked nothing better she was off with you to these parts before i knew it i myself was off too away off to wonderful parts where i had endlessly more to see

2514-149482-0076_248-130697-0011.wav,that that isn't knowing her and that one may know better a person whom one doesn't see as i say half so much the discrimination was interesting but it brought them back to the fact of her success and it was at that comparatively gross circumstance
2514-149482-0077_6064-300880-0008.wav,now so fully placed before them that milly's anxious companion sat and looked looked very much as some spectator in an old time circus might have watched the oddity of a christian maiden in the arena mildly caressingly martyred
2514-149482-0079_7402-90848-0041.wav,he wondered afterwards if kate had made this out though it was not indeed till much later on that he found himself in thought dividing the things she might have been conscious of from the things she must have missed
2514-149482-0080_4018-107312-0005.wav,if she actually missed at any rate missus stringham's discomfort that but showed how her own idea held her her own idea was by insisting on the fact of the girl's prominence as a feature of the season's end
2514-149482-0082_27-124992-0050.wav,we've a little been of it the great thing for him at this as kate gave it was in fact quite irresistibly that the case was a real one the kind of thing that when one's patience was shorter than one's curiosity
2514-149482-0085_1235-135887-0010.wav,as ocean currents the huddled herd had drifted to her blindly it might as blindly have drifted away
2514-149482-0087_1723-141149-0017.wav,and what was of the essence of it was grist to his scribbling mill matter for his journalising hand that hand already in intention played over it the motive as a sign of the season a feature of the time of the purely expeditious
2514-149482-0088_6563-285357-0009.wav,and rough and tumble nature of the social boom the boom as in itself required that would be the note the subject of the process a comparatively minor question anything was boomable enough when nothing else was more so

2514-149482-0091_8051-295385-0025.wav,and the tone of society went so far as to make him take up again his sense of independence he had supposed himself civilised but if this was civilisation one could smoke one's pipe outside when twaddle was within
2514-149482-0094_7517-100429-0025.wav,not the least little bit only a poor silly though quite harmless imitation what she might have passed for saying however was practically merged in what she did say for she came overtly to his aid very much as if guessing some of his thoughts
2514-149482-0095_4362-15663-0017.wav,she enunciated to relieve his bewilderment the obvious truth that you couldn't leave london for three months at that time of the year and come back to find your friends just where they were as they had of course been jigging away
2514-149482-0097_4441-76262-0027.wav,but it was they all of them together who had developed her she was always a charmer one of the greatest ever seen but she wasn't the person he had backed
2514-149482-0098_7190-90542-0054.wav,densher was to feel sure afterwards that kate had had in these pleasantries no conscious above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor susan shepherd's property in their young friend which property by such remarks
2514-149482-0100_7278-104730-0017.wav,that it was true would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passion the rare passion of friendship the sole passion of her little life save the one other more imperturbably cerebral
2514-149482-0101_254-12312-0019.wav,she slipped in the observation that her milly was incapable of change was just exactly on the contrary
2514-149482-0102_6529-62554-0008.wav,she was perfectly kind to susie it was as if she positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she kate had type and by being committed to admiration of type
2514-149482-0103_8419-293473-0019.wav,kate had occasion subsequently she found it somehow to mention to our young man milly's having spoken to her of this view on the good lady's part she would like milly had had it from her to put kate croy in a book and see what she could so do with her
2514-149482-0104_730-359-0019.wav,chop me up fine or serve me whole it was a way of being got at that kate professed she dreaded it would be missus stringham's however she understood because missus stringham oddly felt
2514-149482-0106_4088-158077-0031.wav,yet densher might even then have felt them in the air they were practically in it already when kate waiving the question of her friend's chemical change wound up with the comparatively unobjectionable proposition that he must now having missed so much

2518-154825-0006_3723-171631-0033.wav,but i will put a kerchief round and while i wrap it listen to how we lie and then choose what we shall do i nodded biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me and he went on
2518-154825-0009_6454-93938-0006.wav,and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a charge in air so one thing we can do is to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg
2518-154825-0010_3947-13262-0049.wav,and they will take thee alive and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end
2518-154825-0013_5703-47212-0019.wav,just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle path leads down but not a hundred yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts
2518-154825-0017_7067-76048-0036.wav,it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall
2518-154825-0018_211-122425-0013.wav,tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg
2518-154825-0022_4898-20016-0022.wav,faugh said elzevir tis a poor beast has lost his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag

2518-154825-0026_4160-14187-0024.wav,so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
2518-154825-0030_3607-29116-0034.wav,and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop
2518-154825-0034_7264-92316-0042.wav,but spent much time that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he
2518-154825-0036_5322-7679-0023.wav,but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
2518-154825-0037_307-127539-0024.wav,and then while he knelt down upon the path
2518-154825-0038_6454-107462-0007.wav,putting my arms round his neck and so he bore me pickaback i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
2518-154825-0040_8425-287387-0008.wav,i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
2518-154825-0041_5778-54535-0024.wav,felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff
2518-154825-0046_460-172357-0016.wav,like sitting guillemots against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
2518-154825-0049_211-122442-0007.wav,i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gulls seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said
2518-154825-0054_27-123349-0009.wav,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright of falling left me in a moment
2518-154825-0056_5750-35690-0027.wav,thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us
2518-154826-0000_839-130898-0095.wav,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver grey film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
2518-154826-0005_2391-145015-0101.wav,there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of sleep
2518-154826-0006_460-172359-0018.wav,and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
2518-154826-0007_5688-15787-0005.wav,this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbeck which they call joseph's pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there
2518-154826-0009_2002-139469-0086.wav,that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
2518-154826-0010_2514-149482-0089.wav,it was after noon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
2518-154826-0011_4088-158077-0008.wav,the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
2518-154826-0015_2952-410-0045.wav,so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up
2518-154826-0020_2893-139322-0021.wav,then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
2518-154826-0021_78-369-0011.wav,that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones then i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty
2518-154826-0022_1502-122619-0073.wav,but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
2518-154826-0023_3259-158083-0098.wav,and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
2518-154826-0028_1447-17506-0018.wav,no time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy
2518-154826-0029_1334-135589-0035.wav,and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
2518-154826-0030_7078-271888-0113.wav,but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more says elzevir the tempter
2518-154826-0031_8098-275181-0023.wav,the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion
2518-154826-0032_4051-11218-0060.wav,for while he spoke i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied round my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the firelock
2518-154826-0033_8580-287364-0024.wav,these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hill side come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb

2518-154826-0038_481-123720-0034.wav,and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again
2518-154826-0040_8838-298546-0020.wav,although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbeck marble which you see in old churches in our country
2518-154826-0041_911-130578-0004.wav,and i am told in other parts of england as well and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned askew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then
2518-154826-0046_2289-152258-0013.wav,on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of the shafts
2518-154826-0047_8098-278252-0000.wav,for if it were not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low
2518-154826-0051_1841-159771-0021.wav,and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
2518-154826-0054_302-123516-0009.wav,and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and lit a match

2836-5354-0053_2092-145706-0074.wav,the girl departed closing the door and lady isabel sat looking at it schooling her patience another moment and it was flung open sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in she waved him off begging him
2836-5355-0005_5393-19219-0044.wav,what fancies you do take up uttered francis levison some time subsequent to your departure she quietly went on one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets
2836-5355-0009_7067-76047-0020.wav,would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it you deem that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time
2836-5355-0011_4441-76250-0002.wav,when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed
2836-5355-0012_6078-54007-0026.wav,and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed he did not take the trouble to look at it i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy he resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words
2836-5355-0016_7067-76048-0031.wav,she shook her head all the reparation in your power to make all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin it and the effects must lie upon me forever oh sin was the derisive exclamation
2836-5355-0018_2196-170379-0016.wav,whose fits of ill temper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger toward your husband
2836-5355-0027_4853-29413-0021.wav,over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle what have you named that young article there the name which ought to have been his by inheritance
2836-5355-0029_7059-77897-0010.wav,who is he like isabel my handsome self were he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided
2836-5355-0031_3830-12530-0006.wav,she made no reply sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child returned to the fire and stood a few moments with his back to it is my room prepared for me do you know he presently asked no it is not she quietly rejoined
2836-5355-0033_7800-283493-0013.wav,which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writing case from it gave it to her she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow unlocked the case and took from it some bank notes
2836-5355-0034_3112-9555-0066.wav,i received these from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so
2836-5355-0035_1183-128659-0016.wav,allow me to return them to you count them return them to me for what inquired sir francis in amazement i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long take them
2836-5355-0038_5561-39621-0017.wav,i beg of you to cease she passionately interrupted what do you take me for take you for why how can you live you have no fortune you must receive assistance from some one i will not receive it from you if the whole world denied me
2836-5355-0039_8419-286676-0011.wav,sarcastically rejoined sir francis generous man a flush deep and painful dyed her cheeks i should have said my late husband you need not have reminded me of the mistake
2836-5355-0040_4297-13009-0055.wav,if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child he at any rate falls to my share i shall give you a few hundred a year with him she beat her hands before her as if beating off the man and his words
2836-5355-0042_2893-139322-0006.wav,don't i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it
2836-5355-0043_4018-107338-0004.wav,resumed sir francis in a little time you may probably wish to recall it in which case a line addressed to me at my banker's will lady isabel drew herself up put away those notes if you please she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence
2836-5355-0045_250-142276-0016.wav,you will have the goodness to order pierre to take away this afternoon and now sir francis i believe that is all we will part to remain mortal enemies from henceforth is that to be it to be strangers she replied correcting him
2836-5355-0047_198-129977-0016.wav,and calling the servants before him there were but two gave them each a year's wages in advance
2836-5355-0049_1235-135883-0005.wav,sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks
2836-5355-0051_7780-274562-0062.wav,but that she seemed never to have gone away from it walking in the flower garden with mister carlyle while the three children played on the lawn her arm was within her husband's and he was relating something to her what the news was she could not remember afterward
2836-5355-0052_2007-149877-0037.wav,excepting that it was connected with the office and old mister dill and that mister carlyle laughed when he told it they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter she awoke
2836-5355-0053_911-128684-0053.wav,alas it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her this last child the ill fated little being in the cradle beside her
2843-152918-0000_6848-76049-0027.wav,they had undergone a remarkable change since our arrival at the butcher's shop they now wandered about fat sleek and contented and their former voracity had completely disappeared
2843-152918-0002_311-124404-0114.wav,there was thus no great sign of depression to be noticed when we came back into the tent after finishing our work and had to while away the time as i went in i could descry wisting a little way off kneeling on the ground
2843-152918-0003_233-155990-0002.wav,and engaged in the manufacture of cutlets the dogs stood in a ring round him and looked on with interest the north east wind whistled and howled the air was thick with driving snow and wisting was not to be envied
2843-152918-0004_3947-13260-0030.wav,to whatever age i may live in the course of the night the wind had gone back to the north and increased to a gale it was blowing and snowing so that when we came out in the morning we could not see the sledges they were half snowed under
2843-152918-0006_3526-176653-0003.wav,we had all taken a turn outside to look at the weather and were sitting on our sleeping bags discussing the poor prospect it's the devil's own weather here at the butcher's said one it looks to me as if it would never get any better
2843-152918-0007_7302-86815-0070.wav,this is the fifth day and it's blowing worse than ever we all agreed there's nothing so bad as lying weather bound like this continued another it takes more out of you than going from morning to night personally i was of the same opinion
2843-152918-0010_458-126305-0006.wav,it is the memory of that morning that comes first to my mind all the qualities that i most admire in a man were clearly shown at that juncture courage and dauntlessness without boasting or big words
2843-152918-0012_4813-248641-0018.wav,the dogs were not much inclined to start and it took time to get them into their harness but at last we were ready one more glance over the camping ground to see that nothing we ought to have with us had been forgotten
2843-152918-0013_200-124139-0013.wav,which we now thought would not be required were left behind the last thing to be done was planting a broken ski upright by the side of the depot it was wisting who did this thinking presumably that an extra mark would do no harm
2843-152918-0014_7800-283478-0010.wav,that it was a happy thought the future will show and then we were off it was a hard pull to begin with both for men and beasts as the high sastrugi continued towards the south
2843-152918-0017_5778-54535-0039.wav,it was like dragging oneself through sand meanwhile the sastrugi grew smaller and smaller and finally they disappeared altogether and the surface became quite flat the going also improved by degrees
2843-152918-0018_6454-93938-0026.wav,for what reason it is difficult to say as the storm continued unabated and the drift now combined with falling snow was thicker than ever it was all the driver could do to see his own dogs the surface
2843-152918-0020_8324-286682-0002.wav,but it alone could not account for the change i did not like this tendency of the ground to fall away in my opinion we ought to have done with anything of that sort after reaching the height at which we were a slight slope upward
2843-152918-0021_2817-142371-0062.wav,possibly but down no that did not agree with my reckoning so far the incline had not been so great as to cause uneasiness but if it seriously began to go downhill we should have to stop and camp
2843-152918-0023_3699-19401-0022.wav,and the rapid pace afterwards had made it impossible to walk as fast the dogs could pull i was therefore following by the side of wisting's sledge and chatting with him suddenly i saw hanssen's dogs shoot ahead
2843-152918-0024_4018-107338-0000.wav,and downhill they went at the wildest pace wisting after them i shouted to hanssen to stop
2843-152918-0025_3259-158083-0069.wav,by twisting his sledge the others who were following stopped when they came up to him we were in the middle of a fairly steep descent what there might be below was not easy to decide nor would we try to find out in that weather
2843-152918-0026_2910-131096-0063.wav,we trampled down a place for the tent in the loose snow and soon got it up it was not a long day's march that we had done eleven and three quarter miles but we had put an end to our stay at the butcher's shop and that was a great thing
2843-152918-0027_211-122442-0045.wav,the boiling point test that evening showed that we were ten thousand three hundred feet above the sea and that we had thus gone down six hundred twenty feet from the butcher's we turned in and went to sleep as soon as it brightened
2843-152918-0030_1088-129236-0016.wav,the sun showed as yet like a pat of butter and had not succeeded in dispersing the thick mists the wind had dropped somewhat but was still fairly strong this is after all the worst part of one's job
2843-152918-0032_3983-5331-0040.wav,the gleam came it did not last long but long enough we lay on the side of a ridge that fell away pretty steeply the descent on the south was too abrupt but on the south east it was better and more gradual
2843-152918-0035_2182-181183-0035.wav,since we had discovered the nature of our immediate surroundings if we once got down to the plain we knew that we could always feel our way on after putting ample brakes on the sledge runners
2843-152918-0036_3947-13262-0003.wav,we started off downhill in a south easterly direction the slight idea of the position that we had been able to get in the morning proved correct the descent was easy and smooth and we reached the plain without any adventure
2843-152918-0040_307-127539-0009.wav,which was real torture to all of us a sledge journey through the sahara could not have offered a worse surface to move over
2843-152918-0044_150-132655-0020.wav,instead of rising gradually we were going slowly down
2843-152918-0045_1363-135842-0017.wav,but what according to dead reckoning our latitude that evening
2843-152918-0046_5652-39938-0062.wav,the night was filled with sharp gusts from the north the morning came with a slack wind but accompanied by mist and snowfall this was abominable here we were advancing over absolutely virgin ground and able to see nothing
2843-152918-0048_1963-142393-0035.wav,luckily for us the snowfall of the last few days had filled these up so as to present a level surface it was heavy going though better than on the previous day as we were advancing still blindly
2843-152918-0049_2952-407-0020.wav,and fretting at the persistently thick weather one of us suddenly called out hullo look there a wild dark summit rose high out of the mass of fog to the east south east it was not far away
2843-152918-0050_405-130894-0060.wav,on the contrary it seemed threateningly near and right over us we stopped and looked at the imposing sight but nature did not expose her objects of interest for long the fog rolled over again thick heavy and dark
2843-152918-0052_4160-11549-0019.wav,two long narrow mountain ridges to the west of us running north and south and completely covered with snow these
2843-152918-0055_5390-30096-0033.wav,we continued our course in the constant expectation of finding some surprise or other in our line of route the air ahead of us was as black as pitch as though it concealed something
2843-152918-0057_2391-145015-0056.wav,does not begin very promisingly fog fog and again fog also fine falling snow which makes the going impossible poor beasts they have toiled hard to get the sledges forward to day
2843-152918-0066_5456-62014-0013.wav,as hard as glass in a short time an immense erection of adamantine blocks of snow rose into the air containing provisions for five men for six days and for eighteen dogs for five days
2843-152918-0067_4195-186237-0006.wav,a number of small articles were also left behind while we were thus occupied the fog had been coming and going some of the intervals had been quite clear and had given me a good view of the nearest part of the range
2843-152918-0069_6848-76049-0007.wav,and olav bjaaland lay closer together behind this group the air had been heavy and black the whole time showing that more land must be concealed there suddenly
2843-152918-0070_87-121553-0030.wav,and the summits of a colossal mountain mass appeared our first impression was that this mountain mount thorvald nilsen must be something over twenty thousand feet high it positively took our breath away
2843-152918-0071_4018-103416-0017.wav,so formidable did it appear but it was only a glimpse that we had and then the fog enclosed it once more we had succeeded in taking a few meagre bearings of the different summits of the nearest group
2843-152918-0074_27-124992-0008.wav,so as to be able to see it still more easily on the way back an observation we had contrived to take while the work was in progress
2843-152918-0075_6836-76549-0013.wav,this did not agree very well with the latitude of our dead reckoning
2843-152918-0083_2911-12359-0025.wav,and a lightning like movement some would call it luck he managed to save himself in this way we worked up about two hundred feet but then we came upon such a labyrinth of yawning chasms and open abysses
2843-152918-0084_2989-138028-0000.wav,that we could not move there was nothing to be done but to find the least disturbed spot and set the tent there as soon as this was done hanssen and i set out to explore we were roped and therefore safe enough
2843-152918-0086_2196-170379-0032.wav,in all directions and evoked a picture of violent confusion thank god we were not here while this was going on i thought to myself as i stood looking out over this battlefield it must have been a spectacle like doomsday
2843-152918-0087_5778-12761-0021.wav,and not on a small scale either to advance in that direction then was hopeless but that was no great matter since our way was to the south on the south we could see nothing the fog lay thick and heavy there
2843-152918-0088_328-129766-0094.wav,this ridge led us on to an icewave about twenty five feet high a formation which was due to the pressure having ceased before the wave had been forced to break and form hummocks
2843-152918-0089_4859-29340-0039.wav,we saw well enough that this would be a difficult place to pass with sledges and dogs but in default of anything better it would have to be done from the top of this wave formation we could see down on the other side
2843-152918-0092_4859-29340-0030.wav,a fissure had opened making a gateway about six feet wide this formation like every thing else on the glacier was obviously very old and for the most part filled with snow
2843-152918-0093_2989-138028-0023.wav,from this point the glacier as far as our view extended to the south looked better and better
2843-152918-0094_298-126791-0050.wav,our companions were no less pleased with the news we brought of our prospects our altitude that evening was eight thousand six hundred fifty feet above the sea that is to say at the foot of the glacier
2843-152918-0101_2196-174172-0042.wav,and allowed us a very good survey of our position we could now see that the two mountain ranges
2843-152918-0105_5703-47212-0003.wav,we were at hell's gate bjaaland took an excellent photograph here which gives a very good idea of the difficulties this part of the journey presented in the foreground
2843-152918-0106_8468-286673-0013.wav,below the high snow ridge that forms one side of a very wide but partly filled up crevasse the marks of ski can be seen in the snow this was the photographer who in passing over this snow bridge
2843-152918-0107_311-124404-0076.wav,struck his ski into it to try the strength of the support close to the tracks can be seen an open piece of the crevasse it is a pale blue at the top but ends in the deepest black in a bottomless abyss
2843-152918-0110_3947-13262-0050.wav,the altitude was eight thousand nine hundred sixty feet above the sea the sun was now in the west and shining directly upon the huge mountain masses it was a fairy landscape in blue and white
2843-152918-0111_1743-142913-0024.wav,clear as it now appeared to be one could understand that the weather was not all that could be wished for the south eastern end of mount thorvald nilsen lost itself in a dark impenetrable cloud
2843-152918-0112_1970-28415-0006.wav,which led one to suspect a continuation in that direction though one could not be certain mount nilsen ah anything more beautiful taking it altogether i have never seen
2843-152918-0113_3664-178355-0033.wav,peaks of the most varied forms rose high into the air partly covered with driving clouds some were sharp but most were long and rounded here and there one saw bright shining glaciers
2843-152918-0114_4018-107338-0005.wav,plunging wildly down the steep sides and merging into the underlying ground in fearful confusion but the most remarkable of them all was mount helmer hanssen its top was as round as the bottom of a bowl
2893-139310-0001_4267-78186-0007.wav,a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre
2893-139310-0002_7312-92432-0010.wav,behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
2893-139310-0003_3242-67168-0002.wav,a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch
2893-139310-0004_4640-19187-0007.wav,and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly
2893-139310-0008_332-128985-0076.wav,it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me
2893-139310-0009_426-122821-0026.wav,councillors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference
2893-139310-0015_8609-262281-0023.wav,why is he not here he has deputed us i am his brother his half brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent
2893-139310-0016_4362-15663-0079.wav,he is at the wind vane offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannised at last even in my name my name master
2893-139310-0017_5703-47212-0008.wav,the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder
2893-139310-0018_3982-178459-0019.wav,no one expected you to wake they were cunning damned tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotise you kill you again the hall dominated everything ostrog is at the wind vane offices ready
2893-139310-0023_2989-138035-0059.wav,on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
2893-139310-0024_446-123502-0037.wav,monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him
2893-139310-0025_3879-174923-0031.wav,but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him
2893-139310-0027_332-128985-0044.wav,a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth
2893-139310-0028_2836-5355-0013.wav,he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed
2893-139310-0030_2764-36619-0012.wav,lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song
2893-139310-0032_39-121914-0041.wav,full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating time tramp tramp he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically
2893-139310-0034_4898-28461-0042.wav,wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtly folding mantle hung from his shoulders
2893-139310-0037_5678-43302-0019.wav,the hall was a vast and intricate space galleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity
2893-139310-0038_302-123504-0029.wav,the whole multitude was swaying in congested masses individual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him momentarily and lost definition again close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by three men

3214-167607-0000_1455-134435-0018.wav,why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result for the russians was and was bound to be
3214-167607-0001_1447-130550-0027.wav,that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the world and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared more than anything in the world
3214-167607-0002_3947-13262-0011.wav,what the result must be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon
3214-167607-0005_4397-15678-0017.wav,he will be three times as strong as i am before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than one to two previously
3214-167607-0006_5808-54425-0008.wav,we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle while napoleon
3214-167607-0007_7635-105409-0009.wav,as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleon's historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop
3214-167607-0009_887-123291-0032.wav,the historians provided cunningly devised evidence
3214-167607-0011_6209-34600-0033.wav,and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question how the battle of borodino and the preceding battle of shevardino were fought
3214-167607-0013_8063-274116-0038.wav,at the very place where the battle was fought in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the twenty fourth we are told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it
3214-167607-0015_458-126305-0029.wav,the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position
3214-167607-0016_1963-142393-0050.wav,he had not himself chosen because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other reasons
3214-167607-0017_233-134440-0042.wav,the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire
3214-167607-0019_3235-28433-0004.wav,that is the position on which the battle took place but never till the twenty fifth of august eighteen twelve did they think that a battle might be fought there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth

3214-167607-0025_163-122947-0063.wav,protected by the river kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow napoleon
3214-167607-0028_226-122538-0010.wav,and the russians not having time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified
3214-167607-0029_4859-22176-0007.wav,by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa
3214-167607-0030_3242-67153-0028.wav,semenovsk and borodino a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia and there the whole battle of the twenty sixth of august took place
3214-167607-0034_7178-34644-0035.wav,at gridneva and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty fourth the first and chief action of the battle of borodino
3214-167607-0037_3699-47246-0011.wav,namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left
3214-167607-0038_7780-274562-0005.wav,and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men
3214-167607-0039_32-4137-0034.wav,poniatowski's action against utitsa and uvarov's on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as

3235-11599-0017_6531-61334-0034.wav,or whether it is a variety compounded out of two beat measures either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats as is often necessary in slow tempi

3240-131232-0022_5322-7678-0022.wav,in such quantities that they were shoveled up it is said that the snails may be considered as a local species
3240-131232-0023_4788-294466-0016.wav,and that in his opinion they had been upon the ground in the first place but that there had been some unusual condition aloft comes out in his observation upon the curious azure blue appearance of the sun at the time
3240-131232-0024_289-121652-0024.wav,that according to das wetter december eighteen ninety two upon august ninth eighteen ninety two a yellow cloud appeared over paderborn germany from this cloud fell a torrential rain in which were hundreds of mussels
3240-131232-0025_4680-16026-0037.wav,there is no mention of whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place nor of a whirlwind lizards
3240-131232-0026_3112-9555-0067.wav,that during a heavy shower july third eighteen sixty he heard a peculiar sound at his feet and looking down saw a snake lying as if stunned by a fall it then came to life gray snake about a foot long
3240-131232-0028_5049-25947-0094.wav,our quasi reasoning upon this subject applies to all segregations so far considered monthly weather review january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven that
3240-131232-0029_8468-294887-0038.wav,rather strictly localized or in a space of two blocks and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found they were crawling on sidewalks in yards and in streets and in masses
3240-131232-0031_7367-86737-0016.wav,in the streets of memphis january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven why that's sensible that's the common sense that has been against us from the first it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not
3240-131232-0032_4813-248641-0052.wav,and had not been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses in the first place if we try to accept that these snakes had been raised from some other part of this earth's surface in a whirlwind if we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them
3240-131232-0034_39-121915-0023.wav,again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes
3240-131232-0035_8226-274371-0033.wav,i don't know how many to a den hundreds maybe but according to the account of this occurrence in the new york times there were thousands of them alive from one foot to eighteen inches in length
3240-131232-0037_19-198-0037.wav,suggests to me something of a migratory nature but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january if ever as to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough
3240-131232-0038_6531-61334-0110.wav,fall of fishes june thirteenth eighteen eighty nine in holland ants august first eighteen eighty nine strasbourg little toads august second eighteen eighty nine savoy

3242-8112-0000_3699-47246-0028.wav,mantelish excused himself and went off with the messenger the door closed quillan came back to his chair we're moving the outfit later tonight the commissioner explained
3242-8112-0001_6019-3185-0070.wav,eight tons of his lab equipment plus his special u league guards oh trigger picked up the puya glass she looked into it it was empty moving where she asked manon said the commissioner tell you about that later
3242-8112-0002_250-142276-0031.wav,every last muscle in trigger's body seemed to go limp simultaneously she settled back slightly in the chair surprised by the force of the reaction she hadn't realized by now how keyed up she was she sighed a small sigh
3242-8112-0003_8468-286673-0036.wav,then she smiled at quillan major she said how about a tiny little refill on that puya about half quillan took care of the tiny little refill commissioner tate said by the way
3242-8112-0005_307-127535-0019.wav,and now said the commissioner we'll talk more freely we tell mantelish just as little as we can to tell you the truth trigger the professor is a terrible handicap on an operation like this i understand he was a great friend of your father's yes she said
3242-8112-0006_4640-19188-0024.wav,going over for visits to mantelish's garden with my father is one of the earliest things i remember i can imagine he's a problem she shifted her gaze curiously from one to the other of the two men what are you people doing
3242-8112-0007_6415-100596-0006.wav,looking for gess fayle and the key unit holati tate said that's about it we're one of a few thousand federation groups assigned to the same general job each group works at its specialties and the information gets correlated
3242-8112-0008_2843-152918-0034.wav,in what way trigger asked well suppose that key unit is lost and stays lost suppose all the other plasmoids put together don't contain enough information to show how the old galactics produced the things and got them to operate
3242-8112-0012_89-218-0004.wav,and the number of planetary confederacies subplanetary governments industrial financial and commercial combines assorted power groups et cetera and so on is something i'd hate to have to calculate what are you driving at she asked
3242-8112-0013_87-121553-0065.wav,they've all been told we're heading for a new golden age courtesy of the plasmoid science practically everybody has believed it now there's considerable doubt
3242-8112-0014_2691-156755-0002.wav,of course practically everybody is going to get very unhappy eh that said commissioner tate is only a little of it yes the thing isn't just lost somebody's got it very likely trigger nodded
3242-8112-0015_8797-294123-0044.wav,so any one of umpteen thousands of organizations in the hub might be the one that has that plasmoid now including said holati any one of the two hundred and fourteen restricted worlds
3242-8112-0016_3723-171115-0011.wav,their treaties of limitation wouldn't have let them get into the plasmoid pie until the others had been at it a decade or so they would have been quite eager there was a little pause then trigger said lordy
3242-8112-0017_8312-279790-0004.wav,the thing could even set off another string of wars that's a point the council is nervous about he said well it certainly is a mess you would have thought the federation might have had a security chief in on that first operation
3242-8112-0019_1841-159771-0010.wav,holati could those things ever become as valuable as people keep saying it's all sounded a little exaggerated to me the commissioner said he'd wondered about it too
3242-8112-0020_4088-158077-0073.wav,i'm not enough of a biologist to make an educated guess what it seems to boil down to is that they might which would be enough to tempt a lot of people to gamble very high for a chance to get control of the plasmoid process
3242-8112-0021_307-127540-0029.wav,and we know definitely that some people are gambling for it how do you know we've been working a couple of leads here pretty short leads so far but you work with what you can get he nodded at the table
3242-8112-0023_6081-42010-0020.wav,i was watching it major quillan said reassuringly from the end of the table
3242-8112-0025_7635-105661-0014.wav,he was curious because he couldn't even guess at what its function was it was just lying there in a cubicle so he did considerable experimenting with it while he waited for gess fayle to show up
3242-8112-0026_1034-121119-0026.wav,and league headquarters fidgeted around hoping to get the kind of report from mantelish and fayle that mantelish thought they'd already received they were wondering where fayle was too but they knew fayle was security so they didn't like to get too nosy
3242-8112-0027_7635-105409-0020.wav,trigger shook her head wonderful so
3242-8112-0031_831-130739-0033.wav,the two lab plasmoids stopped moving while he was there they haven't moved since
3242-8112-0033_7067-76047-0036.wav,the big one induces plasmoid activity the little one modifies it
3242-8112-0034_5561-41616-0006.wav,but his two lab guards and one of the raiders were killed the others got away gess fayle's defection was a certainty by then and everybody was very nervous the feds got there fast and dead brained the raider they learned just two things
3242-8112-0035_6476-57446-0087.wav,one he'd been mind blocked and couldn't have spilled any significant information even if they had got him alive the other item they drew from his brain was a clear impression of the target of the raid the professor's pal here uh huh trigger said lost in thought
3242-8112-0036_1040-133433-0013.wav,she poked repulsive lightly that would be fayle and his associates then or somebody who knew about them did they want to kill it or grab it the commissioner looked at her grab it was the dead brain report why
3242-8112-0039_7226-86965-0025.wav,so trigger said they might have two thirds of what everybody wants and you might have one third right here on the table how many of the later raiders did you catch all of them said the commissioner around forty
3242-8112-0040_445-123860-0024.wav,we got them dead we got them alive it didn't make much difference they were hired hands very expensive hired hands but still just that most of them didn't know a thing we could use the ones that did know something were mind blocked again
3242-8112-0041_311-124404-0040.wav,i thought trigger said reflectively you could un block someone like that you can sometimes if you're very good at it and if you have time enough we couldn't afford to wait a year they died before they could tell us anything
3242-8112-0042_1737-142397-0027.wav,there was a pause then trigger asked how did you get involved in this personally more or less by accident the commissioner said it was in connection with our second lead that's me huh she said unhappily yes
3242-67153-0000_5789-57158-0036.wav,and finds a fair margin of profit in shoving it there's a chance for everything you have learned from latin to poetry in the packing business though we don't use much poetry here except in our street car ads

3242-67153-0005_3879-174923-0010.wav,and there're just as many chances for a fellow as ever but they're a little gun shy and you can't catch them by any such coarse method as putting salt on their tails thirty years ago you could take an old muzzle loader and knock over plenty of ducks in the city limits

3242-67153-0020_3374-298032-0019.wav,jim kept at this for three or four months until his feet began to hurt him i guess and then he was out of a job again it seems he had heard something of a new machine for registering the men that did away with most of the timekeepers except the fellows who watched the machines
3242-67153-0022_8226-274369-0040.wav,i was beginning to take an interest in jim so i brought him up into the office and set him to copying circular letters we used to send out a raft of them to the trade that was just before the general adoption of typewriters when they were still in the experimental stage
3242-67153-0023_311-124404-0052.wav,but jim hadn't been in the office plugging away at the letters for a month before he had the writer's cramp and began nosing around again the first thing i knew he was sicking the agents for the new typewriting machine on to me
3242-67153-0024_1963-142393-0029.wav,and he kept them pounding away until they had made me give them a trial then it was all up with mister jim's job again
3242-67153-0027_2002-139469-0006.wav,at last he had got into something that he took an interest in spending money and he just fairly wallowed in it used to lay awake nights thinking up new ways of getting rid of the old man's profits

3242-67168-0008_7226-86964-0050.wav,of course there was nothing in that to get our pastor or the police after me so i told her to go ahead she went off happy but about a week later she dropped in again looking sort of dissatisfied to find out if i wouldn't build the creche itself

4160-11550-0011_4441-76262-0006.wav,this was a curious consolation the two spent hours together sometimes in the tiny parlor stumbling over berlin wool difficulties and now and then wandering to and fro conversationally from priscilla to the octagon stitch and from the octagon stitch to denis
4160-11550-0013_7059-77897-0005.wav,was when she first heard pamela's love story mentioned she was sitting at work near them when theo chanced to mention arthur brunwalde and to her surprise priscilla looked up from her desk immediately he was your sister's lover was he not she said with an abrupt interest in the subject
4160-11550-0015_6925-80680-0082.wav,no she replied almost timidly pamela is fairer than i am and not so tall we are not alike at all i was not thinking of that said priscilla i was wondering if you were alike in disposition i think i was wondering most whether you would be as faithful as pamela

4160-11550-0021_198-126831-0039.wav,that fairly melted tender hearted old miss elizabeth to tears and caused her to confide afterward to theo the fact that she herself had felt the influence of the tender passion in consequence of the blandishments of a single gentleman of uncertain age
4160-11550-0024_831-130746-0046.wav,he was the only lover i ever had my dear theodora and his name was elderberry a very singular name by the way but he was a very talented man when theo went into the little back bedroom that evening to put on her hat priscilla gower went with her
4160-11550-0025_8425-246962-0025.wav,and as she stood before the dressing table buttoning her sacque she was somewhat puzzled by the expression on her companion's face priscilla had taken up her muff and was stroking the white fur her eyes downcast upon her hand as it moved to and fro the ring upon its forefinger shining in the gaslight
4160-11550-0028_6563-285357-0042.wav,it was a feeling scarcely defined enough to allow her to decide whether it was real pain or only discomfort i do not think i have any message to send she replied thank you miss priscilla she took her muff then
4160-11550-0031_5463-39173-0002.wav,the last time i visited the spas my health improved greatly it was just like her ladyship to become suddenly possessed of a whim and to follow its lead on the spur of the moment she was a woman of caprices and her caprices always ruled the day as this one did to theo's great astonishment
4160-11550-0034_6415-100596-0031.wav,well i think i have made up my mind about it we could go next week and i dare say we could reach vienna before denis oglethorpe goes away theo became suddenly silent she gave vent to no further exclamations she would almost have been willing to give up the pleasure of the journey after that
4160-11550-0035_4297-13009-0036.wav,she was learning that it was best for her not to see denis oglethorpe again and here it seemed that she must see him in spite of herself even though she was conscientious enough to wish to do what was best not so much because it was best for herself as because it was just to priscilla gower
4160-11550-0037_1963-142393-0008.wav,she hoped it might never reach him at all and yet in spite of this she experienced an almost passionately keen sense of disappointment when on the day before their departure lady throckmorton received a letter from him regretting his inability to comply with her request
4160-11550-0039_7067-76048-0044.wav,with an unexpected inconsistent feeling of wretchedness i would have stayed anywhere to have seen him only for a minute he had no need to be so ready to go away
4160-14187-0002_6818-68772-0045.wav,the vehicle drew nearer and at length stopped opposite the house on which polton slid down the stairs with the agility of a harlequin a few moments later i heard his voice ascending from the hall i do hope sir you're not much hurt
4160-14187-0005_3947-13262-0042.wav,a queer affair jervis a very odd affair indeed i was coming up from the borough picking my way mighty carefully across the road on account of the greasy slippery mud and had just reached the foot of london bridge when i heard a heavy lorry coming down the slope a good deal too fast
4160-14187-0009_3112-9554-0013.wav,watching my colleague's face with some eagerness to see what effect this new information would produce on him the result was on the whole disappointing he was interested keenly interested but showed no symptoms of excitement
4160-14187-0010_8098-278278-0035.wav,so john hornby has been plunging in mines eh he said when i had finished he ought to know better at his age did you learn how long he had been in difficulties no but it can hardly have been quite sudden and unforeseen i should think not thorndyke agreed
4160-14187-0011_4014-186183-0019.wav,in which case the depreciation would not have affected him in the same way it would be interesting to know for certain it might have a considerable bearing on the present case might it not undoubtedly said thorndyke it might bear on the case in more ways than one
4160-14187-0012_911-130578-0015.wav,that is well considered said my colleague but what is the special bearing on the case supposing it was so on the supposition i replied that mister hornby was in actual pecuniary difficulties at the date of the robbery it seems to me possible to construct a hypothesis
4160-14187-0013_426-122822-0031.wav,in fact it is almost fantastic never mind that said he a sound thinker gives equal consideration to the probable and the improbable thus encouraged i proceeded to set forth the theory of the crime as it had occurred to me on my way home in the fog
4160-14187-0019_332-128985-0045.wav,was the crime committed by the person who made this finger print that is where the corroboration is required that practically leaves the case to be investigated without reference to the finger print which thus becomes of no importance not at all rejoined thorndyke
4160-14187-0020_5867-48852-0026.wav,the finger print is a most valuable clue as long as its evidential value is not exaggerated take our present case for instance without the thumb print the robbery might have been committed by anybody there is no clue whatever
4160-14187-0022_2002-139469-0023.wav,now putting aside the some other person for consideration only if the first three hypotheses fail we have left reuben walter and john but if we leave the thumb print out of the question the probabilities evidently point to john hornby
4160-14187-0026_2911-15084-0002.wav,as to walter hornby he may have had the means of obtaining reuben's thumb mark but there is no evidence that he had access either to the diamonds or to mister hornby's memorandum block
4160-14187-0027_6078-54013-0042.wav,the actual points at issue then i said are whether reuben had any means of opening the safe and whether mister hornby ever did actually have the opportunity of obtaining reuben's thumb mark in blood on his memorandum block
4195-17507-0003_26-495-0055.wav,ah but the amalfi road signore surely you will see that

4195-17507-0025_587-41619-0011.wav,and on the other side of the road the cliffs continue to ascend a like distance toward the sky
4195-17507-0027_5022-29411-0004.wav,from that distance the boats drawn upon the sheltered beach seemed like mere toys then they would span a chasm on a narrow stone bridge or plunge through an arch dividing the solid mountain
4195-17507-0028_39-121914-0021.wav,when the great adventure of the day overtook them without warning the wind came whistling around them in a great gale which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses reeling against the low parapet
4195-17507-0030_8226-274371-0047.wav,at this critical moment a mounted horseman who unobserved had been following the party dashed to their rescue the rider caught the plunging steeds by their heads and tried to restrain their terror at his own eminent peril
4195-17507-0031_2836-5355-0006.wav,while the carriage lay wedged against the wall and the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway between sea and sky

4195-17507-0041_32-21631-0001.wav,as if they had never known a moment's fear in their lives so the girls and their uncle climbed into the vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with his usual vigor
4195-17507-0042_6563-63821-0025.wav,the wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen and as they passed through positano which is four hundred feet high
4195-17507-0044_5104-33407-0046.wav,now a hotel much favored by the tourist count ferralti promised to join them later and rode on to the town to find a surgeon to look after his injured hand while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a zigzag fashion up to the old monastery
4195-17507-0047_5104-33406-0040.wav,in spite of his courage he could eat no luncheon but merely sipped a glass of wine so uncle john alarmed at his pallor insisted that he take a seat in the carriage on the return journey
4195-17507-0048_6836-61803-0011.wav,and beth mounted the box and rode beside her friend the driver
4195-186236-0003_7178-34645-0022.wav,but being unaware of its import gave it but passing attention the main subject of conversation was aunt jane's surprising act in annulling her last will and forcing patricia to accept the inheritance when she did not want it
4195-186236-0014_3982-182255-0002.wav,good by to my five thousand said uncle john with his chuckling laugh but i'm much obliged to jane nevertheless don't we get anything at all asked beth with quivering lip no my dear answered the lawyer gently your aunt owned nothing to give you

4195-186237-0024_2817-142371-0072.wav,meantime said uncle john smiling at them i'll look around myself to be sure agreed the major between the two of us and patsy we ought to have no trouble at all there was a moment of thoughtful silence after this and then patsy said
4195-186237-0026_3947-13260-0047.wav,and if he has money he wants to treat every man he meets uncle john shook his head reproachfully at the major a very bad habit sir he said

4853-27671-0007_3168-173565-0004.wav,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prised her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
4853-27671-0010_200-124139-0032.wav,i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham

5163-39921-0028_4137-11701-0049.wav,but she was baffled by the elusive system of defiance which the cropper boys had organized one day she resolved to go to mister cropper himself and appeal to his sense of justice if he had any
5163-39921-0032_1183-124566-0000.wav,and after school went up to isaac cropper's house that gentleman himself came in from the harvest field looking as courtly as usual even in his rough working clothes he shook hands heartily told her he was glad to see her

5163-39921-0051_3486-166446-0014.wav,and i had decided before this that i'd let her have them after this it's only a trifle anyhow and about that little matter we were discussing the other night miss maxwell i have been thinking it over and

5192-19396-0010_5339-14134-0000.wav,so that when an attack was resolved upon missus wadman had nothing more to do when she had got advanced to the door of the sentry box but to extend her right hand
5192-19396-0014_5322-7680-0015.wav,the difference it made in the attack was this that in going upon it as in the first case with the end of her fore finger against the end of my uncle toby's tobacco pipe she might have travelled with it along the lines from dan to beersheba had my uncle toby's lines reach'd so far
5192-19396-0015_405-130895-0019.wav,without any effect for as there was no arterial or vital heat in the end of the tobacco pipe it could excite no sentiment it could neither give fire by pulsation or receive it by sympathy

6529-62554-0015_211-122442-0013.wav,master then said nebraska my idea is that we may search as long as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about but that we shall not discover him till he pleases that's not bad what you say nebraska observed pencroft
6529-62554-0016_4051-11218-0046.wav,i am of neb's opinion said gideon spilett but that is no reason for not attempting the adventure whether we find this mysterious being or not we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him
6529-62554-0017_196-122150-0034.wav,and you my boy give us your opinion said the engineer turning to herbert oh cried herbert his countenance full of animation how i should like to thank him he who saved you first and who has now saved us
6529-62554-0018_6476-96661-0026.wav,of course my boy replied pencroft so would i and all of us i am not inquisitive but i would give one of my eyes to see this individual face to face it seems to me that he must be handsome tall strong with a splendid beard radiant hair
6529-62554-0021_1926-147979-0053.wav,i too as you said have a debt of gratitude to pay him it was he it could be only he who must have come to tabor island who found there the wretch you knew and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved

6529-62554-0023_8014-112602-0041.wav,we will search into its most secret recesses and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions for several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the harvest
6529-62554-0024_1455-134435-0038.wav,before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution they wished to get all possible work finished it was also the time for collecting the various vegetables from the tabor island plants all was stowed away
6529-62554-0025_7505-258964-0005.wav,and happily there was no want of room in granite house in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island the products of the colony were there methodically arranged and in a safe place as may be believed sheltered as much from animals as from man
6529-62554-0026_125-121342-0021.wav,there was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick axe or mine and granite house thus became a general warehouse
6529-62554-0027_4898-20016-0008.wav,containing all the provisions arms tools and spare utensils in a word all the stores of the colony as to the guns obtained from the brig they were pretty pieces of ordnance which at pencroft's entreaty
6529-62554-0028_3807-4923-0001.wav,were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys right up into granite house embrasures were made between the windows and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff from this height they commanded all union bay
6529-62554-0029_7078-271888-0058.wav,it would be a good thing if we tried the range of our guns do you think that is useful asked the engineer it is more than useful it is necessary without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided
6529-62554-0030_8747-293952-0038.wav,try them pencroft replied the engineer however i think that in making the experiment we ought to employ
6529-62554-0033_8425-291444-0007.wav,the initial velocity is in proportion to the quantity of powder used in the fabrication of these pieces everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible power of resistance and steel is incontestably that metal of all others which resists the best
6529-62554-0035_3168-173565-0028.wav,it is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order since they had been taken from the water the sailor had bestowed great care upon them how many hours he had spent in rubbing greasing and polishing them and in cleaning the mechanism
6529-62554-0037_19-227-0044.wav,they were charged with pyroxyle taking into consideration its explosive power which as has been said is four times that of ordinary powder the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic pencroft holding the end of the quick match
6529-62554-0044_3857-182315-0011.wav,he has as much right to speak here as any one yes said gideon spilett but his reserve does him honor and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past certainly mister spilett answered the sailor
6529-62554-0045_8797-294123-0022.wav,is that your opinion pencroft asked the engineer quite my opinion and before hunting them mercilessly you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us
6529-62554-0046_26-495-0018.wav,pencroft think of ayrton said herbert taking the sailor's hand he became an honest man again pencroft looked at his companions one after the other he had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection
6529-62554-0051_6019-3185-0062.wav,suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you within good range of your guns you would not fire i would fire on him as i would on a mad dog nebraska replied pencroft coldly pencroft said the engineer
6529-62554-0054_322-124147-0008.wav,after all the island was large and fertile if any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed was it not their interest in the situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life
6529-62554-0056_6367-65536-0044.wav,and now six convicts of the worst description perhaps were roaming over their island it was serious certainly and to less brave men it would have been security lost no matter
6529-62556-0000_1263-139804-0027.wav,at herbert's cry pencroft letting his gun fall rushed towards him they have killed him he cried my boy they have killed him cyrus harding and gideon spilett ran to herbert the reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad's heart was still beating
6529-62556-0004_2391-145015-0007.wav,on seeing herbert senseless the sailor's grief was terrible he sobbed he cried he tried to beat his head against the wall neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him
6529-62556-0008_8098-278278-0039.wav,he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his last sigh herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound by which the ball had immediately escaped god be praised said the reporter the ball is not in the body and we shall not have to extract it
6529-62556-0009_1088-134315-0048.wav,but the heart asked harding the heart has not been touched if it had been herbert would be dead dead exclaimed pencroft with a groan the sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter
6529-62556-0011_8088-284756-0053.wav,pencroft was silent but a reaction set in and great tears rolled down his cheeks in the meanwhile gideon spilett endeavored to collect his ideas and proceed methodically after his examination he had no doubt that the ball
6529-62556-0012_6836-61804-0019.wav,entering in front between the seventh and eighth ribs had issued behind between the third and fourth but what mischief had the ball committed in its passage what important organs had been reached a professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at once
6529-62556-0013_5456-62014-0011.wav,and still more so the reporter however he knew one thing this was that he would have to prevent the inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts then to contend with the local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound perhaps mortal
6529-62556-0016_2514-149482-0067.wav,the reporter therefore thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water herbert was placed on his left side and was maintained in that position he must not be moved said gideon spilett
6529-62556-0018_887-123290-0029.wav,cyrus said he i am not a surgeon i am in terrible perplexity you must aid me with your advice your experience take courage my friend answered the engineer pressing the reporter's hand judge coolly
6529-62556-0019_3242-67168-0024.wav,think only of this herbert must be saved these words restored to gideon spilett that self possession which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility he seated himself close to the bed cyrus harding stood near
6529-62556-0021_2952-410-0053.wav,and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest harding approved entirely and it was decided that the two wounds should be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation and now
6529-62556-0022_3983-5371-0050.wav,did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against the inflammation which might occur yes they had one for nature had generously lavished it they had cold water that is to say the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds
6529-62556-0024_6925-80680-0031.wav,since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous during the first days gideon spilett and cyrus harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense and they acted as the best surgeon would have done
6529-62556-0025_7302-86815-0023.wav,compresses of linen were applied to poor herbert's two wounds and were kept constantly wet with cold water the sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut which was not wanting in things necessary for life maple sugar medicinal plants
6529-62556-0027_150-126112-0009.wav,herbert's life hung on a thread and this thread might break at any moment the next day the twelfth of november the hopes of harding and his companions slightly revived herbert had come out of his long stupor he opened his eyes he recognized cyrus harding
6529-62556-0028_89-219-0050.wav,the reporter and pencroft he uttered two or three words he did not know what had happened they told him and spilett begged him to remain perfectly still telling him that his life was not in danger and that his wounds would heal in a few days
6529-62556-0033_625-132112-0012.wav,they did not think either of the danger which threatened them should the convicts return or of the precautions to be taken for the future but on this day while pencroft watched by the sick bed cyrus harding and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do
6529-62556-0035_4640-19187-0039.wav,and as he was a man to defend himself he must have been overpowered yes that is to be feared said the reporter then doubtless the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything and only fled when they saw us coming
6529-62556-0038_8226-274369-0006.wav,he must not come returned cyrus harding quickly he would be murdered on the road it is very probable however that he will attempt to rejoin us ah if the telegraph still acted he might be warned but that is impossible now
6529-62556-0039_1447-130552-0014.wav,as to leaving pencroft and herbert here alone we could not do it well i will go alone to granite house no no cyrus answered the reporter you must not expose yourself your courage would be of no avail the villains are evidently watching the corral
6529-62556-0040_229-130880-0091.wav,they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it and if you go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one

8465-246940-0004_6454-93938-0020.wav,you wouldn't talk about work to a man dying of hunger would you i'm not sure about that he wouldn't heed you perhaps not what would you do then give him some food and try him again i think

8465-246940-0012_4397-15678-0032.wav,will you not tell me something about it said the curate yet more gently

8975-270782-0021_311-124404-0061.wav,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he
8975-270782-0022_229-130880-0088.wav,in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asks the question whence such a wish comes
8975-270782-0023_7447-91187-0015.wav,we need not hesitate to point out this origin these evil wish impulses have their origin in the past often in a past which is not too far away
8975-270782-0027_669-129061-0069.wav,indeed translated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some loved one which seems so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person
8975-270782-0028_446-123502-0013.wav,this wish was no stranger to him while the child was still a suckling this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom
8975-270782-0032_6880-216547-0020.wav,and is substantiated by memory yet this is no explanation it is long outlived to day it can be present only in the unconscious and as an empty emotionless memory but not as a strong impulse why should it be recalled by the dream at all this question is justified

8975-270782-0035_8630-305212-0043.wav,which most frequently can be traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer
8975-270782-0037_2518-154825-0042.wav,we have wondered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature and certainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past

8975-270782-0055_2518-154825-0035.wav,the abstention from sexual liberty which society demands in certain cases also she is the rival who objects to being displaced the same type of thing occurs in a more glaring manner between father and son
8975-270782-0056_7226-86965-0036.wav,to the son the father is the embodiment of every social restriction borne with such great opposition the father bars the way to freedom of will to early sexual satisfaction

8975-270782-0058_1334-135589-0075.wav,the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistical considerations why do i speak of these things so banal and so well known
8975-270782-0060_1098-133695-0013.wav,rather than that this task should be left to the cynic in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal
8975-270782-0061_2136-5143-0011.wav,it is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people the dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents especially the parent of the same sex we may conclude that it is also present during waking hours
8975-270782-0062_7226-86965-0005.wav,as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example three it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses
8975-270782-0066_1363-135842-0008.wav,who is a disturbing element in her tender relationship with her father and who occupies a position that she could very well fill herself one learns from these observations to what early years these ideas extend back
8975-270782-0067_6818-76332-0004.wav,ideas which we designate as the oedipus complex because this myth realizes with a very slightly weakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the son to kill his father and take his mother to wife

8975-270782-0074_730-359-0020.wav,with a large number of motives in unending variations derivations and disguises also in distorted forms such as we recognize to be the work of a censor we may also ascribe this oedipus complex to those dreamers
8975-270782-0076_403-126855-0026.wav,by applying our former researches to the study of the psychic life of the child we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden dream wishes of excessive sexual impulses may be explained in the same manner
8975-270782-0077_911-128684-0031.wav,thus we are moved to study the development of sex life in the child also and we discover the following from a number of sources in the first place it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual life and to take it for granted
8975-270782-0078_5104-33406-0007.wav,that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects
8975-270782-0079_2384-152900-0031.wav,what we call perverse in the life of the adult differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the gulf between man and animal second
8975-270782-0081_7511-102419-0013.wav,he knows no unbridgable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he is not disgusted at the sight of excrement but slowly learns to be so disgusted
8975-270782-0086_7067-76047-0006.wav,and then at the writing table defend the sexual purity of the same children where children are left to themselves or are under the influence of corruption
8975-270782-0088_412-126975-0018.wav,but these things do exist they have their significance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and furtherances of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man
8975-270782-0089_2893-139322-0002.wav,when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field
8975-270782-0090_1963-142393-0013.wav,those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what antipathy society feels toward such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it
8975-270782-0091_2514-149482-0017.wav,the most monstrous efforts have been made to explain this fear of incest some have believed that it is due to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature which is psychically represented by this prohibition because inbreeding would deteriorate the race character
8975-270782-0092_19-227-0063.wav,others maintained that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the persons under consideration in both cases furthermore the incest avoidance would be automatically assured
8975-270782-0096_200-124140-0024.wav,infantile side of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions partly because it is lightly considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child
8975-270782-0099_5104-33406-0027.wav,but being reasonable is only a part of psychic life many things are taking place there that are not reasonable and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams and unreasonably we turn them over to the dream censorship
8975-270782-0101_6415-111615-0016.wav,as we would be if we understood it just think of the scandalized opinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of services of love the problem is not yet solved
8975-270782-0102_6880-216547-0081.wav,and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts
8975-270782-0103_103-1241-0026.wav,which however disclose only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dream work is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression
8975-270782-0104_7517-100442-0021.wav,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even our old intellectual property
8975-270782-0107_8051-119902-0024.wav,how does one solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that shares its characteristics
8975-270782-0110_1502-122619-0056.wav,that we are able to attain without having searched through further psychic realms the time will soon come however when we shall clothe the unconscious character of the latent dream thought with another name
8975-270782-0111_26-495-0010.wav,which shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we may to be sure propound the question what forces the psychological activity during sleep to such regression
8975-270782-0114_103-1240-0018.wav,that only in this manner can a dream be built up
