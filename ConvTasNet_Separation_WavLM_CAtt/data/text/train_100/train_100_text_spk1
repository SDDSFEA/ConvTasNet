103-1240-0004_4195-186237-0003 BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE

1034-121119-0002_7859-102519-0000 WHO AFTER BEING MOMENTARILY CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW WHICH HAD STRUCK HER HAD GONE TO SEEK HER USUAL ADVISER LUCIEN DEBRAY THE BARONESS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MARRIAGE AS A MEANS OF RIDDING HER OF A GUARDIANSHIP WHICH OVER A GIRL OF EUGENIE'S CHARACTER
1034-121119-0003_7447-91187-0057 FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
1034-121119-0005_87-121553-0036 NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A SOURCE OF DISSENSION AND SCANDAL UNDER THE PATERNAL ROOF BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD AT ONCE CLASSED HIM IN THAT CATALOGUE OF BIPEDS WHOM PLATO ENDEAVORS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE APPELLATION OF MEN
1034-121119-0006_481-123720-0040 UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS WORLD OF OURS EACH PERSON VIEWS THINGS THROUGH A CERTAIN MEDIUM AND SO IS PREVENTED FROM SEEING IN THE SAME LIGHT AS OTHERS AND MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EUGENIE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE
1034-121119-0007_4160-11549-0032 NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE MATCH WAS GOOD AND LIKELY TO INSURE THE HAPPINESS OF HER CHILD BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO SET HER AT LIBERTY SHE RAN THEREFORE TO DEBRAY WHO AFTER HAVING LIKE THE REST OF PARIS WITNESSED THE CONTRACT SCENE AND THE SCANDAL ATTENDING IT
1034-121119-0008_118-47824-0033 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0010_441-130108-0017 DEBRAY WAS OCCUPIED IN REPELLING THE INSINUATIONS OF A FRIEND WHO TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM
1034-121119-0011_5867-48852-0049 STILL WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE INDEPENDENT PROUD SPIRIT OF EUGENIE HE POSITIVELY REJECTED IT AS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THE SAME THOUGHT AGAIN CONTINUALLY RECURRED AND FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN HIS HEART TEA PLAY
1034-121119-0015_201-127786-0004 THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
1034-121119-0017_6454-120342-0018 AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID

1034-121119-0028_4830-25898-0048 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY

1040-133433-0022_40-121026-0024 I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE WENDY KNEW THIS THAT HER LAST WORDS TO HIM WERE THESE RATHER PLAINTIVE ONES YOU WON'T FORGET ME PETER WILL YOU BEFORE SPRING CLEANING TIME COMES OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY HE TOOK MISSUS DARLING'S KISS WITH HIM
1040-133433-0026_2952-408-0003 THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
1040-133433-0029_3112-9555-0014 WHO IS TINKER BELL O PETER SHE SAID SHOCKED BUT EVEN WHEN SHE EXPLAINED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF THEM HE SAID I EXPECT SHE IS NO MORE I EXPECT HE WAS RIGHT FOR FAIRIES DON'T LIVE LONG
1040-133433-0030_669-129061-0081 BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
1040-133433-0031_150-132655-0023 BUT HE WAS EXACTLY AS FASCINATING AS EVER AND THEY HAD A LOVELY SPRING CLEANING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE TREE TOPS NEXT YEAR HE DID NOT COME FOR HER SHE WAITED IN A NEW FROCK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE SIMPLY WOULD NOT MEET BUT HE NEVER CAME
1040-133433-0032_5703-47212-0025 PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
1040-133433-0034_8063-274115-0029 AND SHE FELT SHE WAS UNTRUE TO HIM WHEN SHE GOT A PRIZE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE BUT THE YEARS CAME AND WENT WITHOUT BRINGING THE CARELESS BOY AND WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WENDY WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND PETER WAS NO MORE TO HER
1040-133433-0035_7078-271888-0055 THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
1040-133433-0036_1455-138263-0052 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA

1040-133433-0041_4640-19188-0040 SHE DIED OF OLD AGE AND AT THE END SHE HAD BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ON WITH BEING VERY FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN EXCEPT HERSELF ONCE A WEEK JANE'S NURSE HAD HER EVENING OFF
1040-133433-0042_696-92939-0019 AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
1040-133433-0044_3830-12530-0033 THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO SWEETHEART SAYS WENDY AH ME HOW TIME FLIES DOES IT FLY ASKS THE ARTFUL CHILD THE WAY YOU FLEW WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL

1040-133433-0050_3112-9554-0004 YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
1040-133433-0052_3664-11714-0004 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
1040-133433-0056_6081-41998-0019 WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
1040-133433-0058_5339-14133-0042 A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
1040-133433-0059_1116-132847-0030 SHE REPLIED FAINTLY SQUEEZING HERSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SOMETHING INSIDE HER WAS CRYING WOMAN WOMAN LET GO OF ME HULLO WHERE IS JOHN HE ASKED SUDDENLY MISSING THE THIRD BED
1040-133433-0062_6529-62556-0010 PETER SHE SAID FALTERING ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO FLY AWAY WITH YOU OF COURSE THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME HE ADDED A LITTLE STERNLY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THIS IS SPRING CLEANING TIME
1040-133433-0065_1355-39947-0059 FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
1040-133433-0067_696-93314-0037 THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
1040-133433-0068_2836-5355-0044 I AM OLD PETER I AM EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY I GREW UP LONG AGO YOU PROMISED NOT TO I COULDN'T HELP IT
1040-133433-0069_1116-132847-0005 NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
1040-133433-0074_696-93314-0052 WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
1040-133433-0075_6147-34607-0040 HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
1040-133433-0077_6529-62554-0010 IF ONLY I COULD GO WITH YOU WENDY SIGHED YOU SEE YOU CAN'T FLY SAID JANE OF COURSE IN THE END WENDY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER
1069-133699-0000_1553-140047-0012 HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
1069-133699-0001_7511-102419-0020 TO DEAL WITH HER IN STRICT RECIPROCITY HE CARRIED OUT HIS RESOLVE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TACT AND THE YOUNG LADY FOUND IN RENEWED CONTACT WITH HIM NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXERCISE OF HER GENIUS FOR UNSHRINKING ENQUIRY
1069-133699-0003_1737-142396-0007 SHE PRESENTLY DISCOVERED IN TRUTH THAT THIS OBLIGATION WAS OF THE LIGHTEST AND THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CARED VERY LITTLE HOW MISS STACKPOLE BEHAVED MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD DEFINED HER TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0006_4481-17498-0038 MY DEAR YOU'D HAVE A VERY SMALL SOCIETY MISSUS TOUCHETT FRANKLY ADMITTED AND I DON'T THINK I LIKE ANY MAN OR WOMAN WELL ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO RECOMMENDING IT'S A SERIOUS AFFAIR
1069-133699-0008_1970-10594-0016 I'M SURE SHE HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND I DETEST THE MANNERS AND THE LIBERTIES OF SUCH PLACES IF YOU ASK ME IF I PREFER MY OWN MANNERS WHICH YOU DOUBTLESS THINK VERY BAD I'LL TELL YOU THAT I PREFER THEM IMMENSELY
1069-133699-0010_2436-2481-0035 MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
1069-133699-0011_839-130898-0055 WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
1069-133699-0012_1088-134315-0011 RALPH WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL GENIALITY SUGGESTED BY WAY OF HEALING THE BREACH THAT THE TRUTH LAY BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN QUESTION OUGHT TO BE DESCRIBED AS FAIR MIDDLING
1069-133699-0013_4830-25898-0035 THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
1069-133699-0016_4160-11550-0017 IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
1069-133699-0019_1263-138246-0032 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
1069-133699-0020_2391-145015-0051 WHICH SHE PRIVATELY JUDGED TO BE A MYSTERIOUS SURVIVAL OF FEUDALISM IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER MIND WAS OPPRESSED WITH THIS IMAGE THAT SHE SUFFERED SOME DAYS TO ELAPSE BEFORE SHE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0022_2836-5355-0041 THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
1069-133699-0025_2159-179157-0033 ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
1069-133699-0026_200-124139-0000 HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOU BUT I SPOKE OF YOU A GOOD DEAL ISABEL WAITED AT THE MENTION OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S NAME SHE HAD TURNED A LITTLE PALE I'M VERY SORRY YOU DID THAT SHE OBSERVED AT LAST
1069-133699-0029_1363-139304-0008 IT'S NOT A GRAND PASSION I'M VERY SURE IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE SURE ISABEL GAVE RATHER A COLD SMILE I SHALL SAY IT BETTER TO MISTER GOODWOOD HIMSELF
1069-133699-0030_87-121553-0032 ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
1069-133699-0031_7148-59157-0001 BY EVERYTHING BUT MISTER GOODWOOD MISS STACKPOLE EXCLAIMED WITH A SLIGHTLY HARSH HILARITY ISABEL FAILED EVEN TO SMILE BACK AND IN A MOMENT SHE SAID DID HE ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME NOT IN SO MANY WORDS
1069-133699-0032_5561-39621-0044 BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
1069-133699-0033_8747-293952-0013 ONE SHOULD GET AS MANY NEW IDEAS AS POSSIBLE YES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OLD ONES WHEN THE OLD ONES HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT ONES ISABEL TURNED ABOUT AGAIN IF YOU MEAN THAT I HAD ANY IDEA WITH REGARD TO MISTER GOODWOOD
1069-133699-0035_163-122947-0023 IT'S VERY TRUE I DID ENCOURAGE HIM AND THEN SHE ASKED IF HER COMPANION HAD LEARNED FROM MISTER GOODWOOD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IT WAS A CONCESSION TO HER CURIOSITY FOR SHE DISLIKED DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT
1069-133699-0036_6019-3185-0073 AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
1069-133699-0039_2289-152257-0012 I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
1069-133699-0040_696-93314-0034 SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
1069-133699-0041_5104-33406-0042 SHE COMMUNICATED HER DISBELIEF TO HER FRIEND FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS NEVERTHELESS SHE STOOD PREPARED TO HEAR THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME ANNOUNCED THE FEELING PRESSED UPON HER IT MADE THE AIR SULTRY
1069-133699-0042_374-180298-0037 AND AFTER STROLLING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME IN A MANNER AT ONCE LISTLESS AND RESTLESS HAD SEATED HERSELF ON A GARDEN BENCH WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE BENEATH A SPREADING BEECH WHERE IN A WHITE DRESS ORNAMENTED WITH BLACK RIBBONS
1069-133699-0043_254-12312-0011 SHE FORMED AMONG THE FLICKERING SHADOWS A GRACEFUL AND HARMONIOUS IMAGE
1069-133699-0047_481-123720-0035 OF LATE IT WAS NOT TO BE DENIED LITERATURE HAD SEEMED A FADING LIGHT AND EVEN AFTER SHE HAD REMINDED HERSELF THAT HER UNCLE'S LIBRARY WAS PROVIDED WITH A COMPLETE SET OF THOSE AUTHORS WHICH NO GENTLEMAN'S COLLECTION SHOULD BE WITHOUT
1069-133699-0051_6437-66173-0025 ARBITRARY OR CAPRICIOUS THEREFORE IT IS THAT I BELIEVE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN YOU TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU AND I BELIEVE IT FOR I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
1069-133699-0053_730-360-0019 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
1069-133709-0001_4160-11549-0012 PROPERTY ERECTS A KIND OF BARRIER YOU CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS IF YOU'RE RICH WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY CRITICISED IF YOU WERE POOR YOU CAN GO AND COME YOU CAN TRAVEL ALONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT
1069-133709-0002_8095-274346-0004 I MEAN OF COURSE IF YOU'LL TAKE A COMPANION SOME DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A DARNED CASHMERE AND DYED HAIR WHO PAINTS ON VELVET YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
1069-133709-0003_7226-86964-0052 SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
1069-133709-0011_4441-76250-0005 SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
1069-133709-0013_7859-102521-0007 THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
1069-133709-0016_4813-248641-0007 ASKED ISABEL ABRUPTLY WHY AS A KIND OF COMPLIMENT A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT ON YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLY EXISTING HE LIKED ME TOO MUCH SHE PRESENTLY DECLARED THAT'S A WAY WE ALL HAVE
1069-133709-0018_4813-248641-0045 IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
1069-133709-0020_2002-139469-0062 HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
1069-133709-0023_1088-129236-0029 LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
1069-133709-0027_8838-298546-0003 WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
1069-133709-0028_1081-128618-0008 YOU'RE A CAPITAL PERSON TO ADVISE SAID RALPH YOU TAKE THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM THOUGH SHE WAS FOLLOWING OUT THE TRAIN OF REFLEXION WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD KINDLED
1069-133709-0030_4297-13006-0038 I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT A GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE POWERLESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S A GREATER HAPPINESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE THE EFFORT NOT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE MUST BE GREAT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WEAK ISABEL ASKED
1069-133709-0031_4362-15663-0038 THE GATE OF ADMIRATIONS ITALY AS YET IMPERFECTLY SEEN AND FELT STRETCHED BEFORE HER AS A LAND OF PROMISE A LAND IN WHICH A LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MIGHT BE COMFORTED BY ENDLESS KNOWLEDGE
1069-133709-0032_587-41611-0026 WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
1069-133709-0033_7067-76047-0004 SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
1069-133709-0035_8088-284756-0008 MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
1069-133709-0036_1553-140048-0002 GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
1069-133709-0037_27-124992-0015 IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
1069-133709-0042_103-1240-0019 SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
1069-133709-0044_3259-158083-0075 AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
1069-133709-0046_6081-42010-0013 A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE

1069-133709-0048_2196-174172-0035 WOULD BE EMINENTLY JUST THIS WAS NOT AS IT MAY SEEM MERELY A THEORY TINGED WITH SARCASM ISABEL CANDIDLY BELIEVED THAT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD IN THE USUAL PHRASE GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
1069-133709-0049_2007-149877-0012 HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED THIS SHE BELIEVED AND SHE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DERIVING PLEASURE FROM THE BELIEF BUT IT WAS ABSURD THAT A MAN BOTH SO INTELLIGENT AND SO HONOURABLY DEALT WITH
1069-133709-0050_2384-152900-0089 SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
1069-133709-0052_6848-252323-0014 SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
1081-125237-0002_1963-142776-0018 BUT THE OLD SORES REMAINED OPEN MOREOVER THE REFUSAL OF THE STATES GENERAL TO RECEIVE THE PARLIAMENTARY ENVOYS THE MURDER OF DORESLAER AND THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO ROYALIST REFUGEES HAD BEEN ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RESENTMENT
1081-125237-0004_322-124147-0080 APPEARED AT FIRST TO OPEN OUT A PROSPECT OF FRIENDLIER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBOURING REPUBLICS IN JANUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THE GREAT ASSEMBLY FORMALLY RECOGNISED THE COMMONWEALTH

1081-125237-0007_374-180298-0059 ON APRIL FOURTH A CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BETWEEN THE ENVOYS AND SIX COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE STATES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOR A MORE STRICT AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE AND UNION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES THE DUTCH QUICKLY PERCEIVED
1081-125237-0008_3235-11599-0013 THAT WHAT THE ENGLISH REALLY WANTED WAS NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH A BINDING ALLIANCE OR RATHER COALITION AS WOULD PRACTICALLY MERGE THE LESSER STATE IN THE GREATER BUT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A LOSS OF THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY HAD ONLY JUST WON WAS TO THE NETHERLANDERS UNTHINKABLE
1081-125237-0010_6925-80680-0067 FOREMOST AMONGST THEM PRINCE EDWARD SON OF THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA THE PARLIAMENT THREATENED TO RECALL THE ENVOYS BUT CONSENTED THAT THEY SHOULD REMAIN ON THE UNDERTAKING OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO PROTECT THEM FROM FURTHER ATTACKS AND TO PUNISH THE OFFENDERS
1081-125237-0012_1737-148989-0018 THE EXPULSION OF THE MEMBERS AND ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STEWART INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ROYAL AND THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA WITH THEIR CHILDREN
1081-125237-0017_322-124147-0069 SCARCELY LESS INJURIOUS WAS THE PROHIBITION TO ALIENS TO FISH IN BRITISH WATERS AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE RIGHTS BASED ON THE MAGNUS INTERCURSUS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WHICH DUTCH STATESMEN HAD SO LONG AND STRENUOUSLY FOUGHT
1081-125237-0018_7078-271888-0079 THERE WAS CONSTERNATION IN HOLLAND AND THE STATES GENERAL DETERMINED TO SEND A SPECIAL EMBASSY TO LONDON
1081-125237-0019_7859-102519-0047 A MAN IN WHOSE RIPE JUDGMENT THEY HAD CONFIDENCE TO THE OFFICE OF COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0023_1553-140047-0032 THE RIGHT OF SEARCH AND THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG THAT WERE TO BE THE REAL CAUSES OF THE OUTBREAK OF A WAR THAT WAS DESIRED BY NEITHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS BUT POPULAR FEELING AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS WAS TOO STRONG FOR THEM THE NEWS OF THE SEIZURE OF THEIR VESSELS
1081-125237-0026_5703-47212-0006 THE COUNCIL OF STATE ON HEARING OF THIS BEGAN ALSO TO MAKE READY FOR EVENTUALITIES NEGOTIATIONS WERE STILL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WHEN MARTIN TROMP THE VICTOR OF THE BATTLE OF THE DOWNS
1081-125237-0030_2514-149482-0046 TO THE FRENCH COAST HAVING LOST TWO SHIPS GREAT WAS THE ANGER AROUSED IN ENGLAND WHERE THE DUTCH WERE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS THE AGGRESSORS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHERE THE PEACE PARTY WAS STRONG MANY WERE DISPOSED TO BLAME TROMP DESPITE HIS PROTESTS
1081-125237-0034_6385-220959-0010 ALL THE ADVANTAGES WERE ON THE SIDE OF THEIR ENEMIES THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS COVERED THE SEAS AND THE WELFARE OF THE LAND DEPENDED ON COMMERCE THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE TO LOSE COMMERCIALLY
1081-125237-0035_8419-286676-0023 WAS SUPERIOR IN ALMOST ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE STUARTS HAD DEVOTED GREAT ATTENTION TO THE FLEET AND WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT FOR LACK OF MEANS CHARLES MUCH ABUSED SHIP MONEY WAS EMPLOYED BY HIM FOR THE CREATION OF THE FIRST ENGLISH PROFESSIONAL NAVY
1081-125237-0036_8797-294123-0026 IT HAD BEEN LARGELY INCREASED BY THE PARLIAMENT AFTER SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT AND ITS GENERALS BLAKE PENN AND AYSCUE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED MUCH VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ROYALIST SQUADRON UNDER PRINCE RUPERT
1081-125237-0038_2002-139469-0054 THE POSITION OF ENGLAND LYING AS IT DID ATHWART THE ROUTES BY WHICH THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS MUST SAIL WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A CENTRAL CONTROL
1081-125237-0039_2893-139310-0000 WHEREAS IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE WERE FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY TO SOME EXTENT JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER AND NOW LACKING THE SUPREME DIRECTION OF AN ADMIRAL GENERAL THE WAR BEGAN BY A SERIES OF ENGLISH SUCCESSES AND OF DUTCH MISFORTUNES
1081-125237-0040_2518-154826-0049 EARLY IN JULY SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO BLAKE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SHIPS SET SAIL FOR THE NORTH TO INTERCEPT THE DUTCH BALTIC COMMERCE AND TO DESTROY THEIR FISHING FLEET OFF THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND
1081-125237-0042_5652-19215-0040 ALL OF THEM BEING CAPTURED OR BURNT WHILE BLAKE WITH THE MAIN FORCE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND DESTROYED THE DUTCH FISHING FLEET AND THEIR CONVOY AFTER THESE FIRST BLOWS AGAINST THE ENEMY'S COMMERCE GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUED TO ATTEND THE ENGLISH
1081-125237-0043_27-124992-0052 TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
1081-125237-0044_6000-55211-0023 FOUND THE ENGLISH FLEET OFF THE SHETLANDS A VIOLENT STORM AROSE FROM THE FORCE OF WHICH BLAKE WAS PROTECTED WHILE THE DUTCH VESSELS WERE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY OUT OF NINETY NINE SHIPS TROMP COULD ONLY COLLECT THIRTY FIVE
1081-125237-0047_7264-92310-0007 THE ILL SUCCESS OF TROMP THOUGH HE WAS IN NO WAY TO BLAME FOR IT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ALARM AND DISCONTENT IN HOLLAND HIS ENEMIES OF THE STATES PARTY IN THAT PROVINCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO SUSPEND THE GALLANT OLD SEAMAN FROM HIS COMMAND HE WAS AN ORANGIST
1081-125237-0053_1334-135589-0077 WHILE MANY ENGLISH PRIZES WERE CAPTURED THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS HOWEVER NOT TO LAST LONG TOWARDS THE END OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE BLAKE PUT TO SEA WITH NEARLY EIGHTY SHIPS AND ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OFF PORTLAND MET TROMP AT THE HEAD OF A FORCE NEARLY EQUAL TO HIS OWN IN NUMBER
1081-125237-0055_1355-39947-0031 HAD LASTED FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS WHEN TROMP FOUND THAT HIS POWDER HAD RUN OUT AND THAT ON THE THIRD DAY MORE THAN HALF HIS FLEET WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE BUT INSPIRING HIS SUBORDINATES DE RUYTER EVERTSEN AND FLORISZOON WITH HIS OWN INDOMITABLE COURAGE
1081-125237-0058_4898-28461-0063 WHILE THE ENGLISH ON THEIR SIDE WERE SHUT OUT FROM THE BALTIC WHERE THE KING OF DENMARK AS THE ALLY OF THE UNITED PROVINCES HAD CLOSED THE SOUND AND FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE ADMIRAL VAN GALEN
1081-125237-0061_6019-3185-0043 HAD BEEN APPOINTED COUNCIL PENSIONARY CROMWELL TOOK PAINS TO LET THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND KNOW HIS FAVOURABLE FEELINGS TOWARDS THEM BY SENDING OVER IN FEBRUARY A PRIVATE EMISSARY
1081-125237-0064_1553-140048-0011 WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY OF DICTATORIAL POWERS
1081-125237-0065_3723-171115-0038 AND THEIR INSISTENCE NOW ON THE FULL SATISFACTION OF ALL THE ENGLISH DEMANDS MADE A CONTINUATION OF HOSTILITIES INEVITABLE TROMP AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BRINGING IN TWO LARGE CONVOYS OF MERCHANTMEN ENCOUNTERED JUNE TWELFTH
1081-125237-0066_1355-39947-0049 NEAR THE GABBARD THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER MONK AND DEANE EACH FLEET NUMBERED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SAIL BUT THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INFERIOR IN SIZE SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT OF METAL FOR TWO DAYS THE FIGHT WAS OBSTINATELY AND FIERCELY CONTESTED
1081-125237-0068_5463-39173-0053 THE ENGLISH NOW INSTITUTED A BLOCKADE OF THE DUTCH COAST WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING TO DESPERATE STRAITS A LAND WHOSE WELFARE AND PROSPERITY DEPENDED WHOLLY ON COMMERCE AMSTERDAM WAS RUINED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DIRECT NEGOTIATION WAS PERFORCE ATTEMPTED
1081-125237-0072_7635-105409-0031 MONK WITH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SHIPS LAY BETWEEN THEM TO PREVENT THEIR JUNCTION ON AUGUST FOURTH TROMP SAILED OUT AND AFTER A REARGUARD ACTION OFF KATWIJK OUT MANOEUVRED THE ENGLISH COMMANDER AND JOINED DE WITH HE NOW TURNED AND WITH SUPERIOR NUMBERS ATTACKED MONK OFF SCHEVENINGEN
1081-125237-0076_6818-76332-0039 FOR THE NEW RULER OF ENGLAND HAD ALWAYS PROFESSED HIMSELF AN OPPONENT OF THE WAR WHICH HAD SHATTERED HIS FANTASTIC DREAM OF A UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS MANY CONFERENCES TOOK PLACE BUT THE PROTECTOR'S ATTITUDE AND INTENTIONS WERE AMBIGUOUS AND DIFFICULT TO DIVINE
1081-125237-0078_446-123501-0011 COMPENSATION TO BE MADE FOR THE MASSACRE OF AMBOINA AND THE OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT PUNISHED THE NUMBER OF WARSHIPS IN ENGLISH WATERS WAS TO BE LIMITED THE FLAG HAD TO BE STRUCK WHEN ENGLISH SHIPS WERE MET AND THE RIGHT OF SEARCH TO BE PERMITTED THESE DEMANDS
1081-125237-0080_1963-147036-0024 WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO PRESENT SUCH PROPOSALS TO THE STATES GENERAL NOT ONLY WOULD THEY INDIGNANTLY REJECT THEM BUT HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF GETTING ANY SINGLE PROVINCE EVEN HOLLAND TO ALLOW A FOREIGN POWER TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS
1081-125237-0081_587-54108-0023 AND TO BID THEM TO TREAT WITH HARSH INGRATITUDE THE INFANT HEIR OF A FAMILY TO WHICH THE DUTCH PEOPLE OWED SO DEEP A DEBT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PREPARE FOR A VIGOROUS RESUMPTION OF THE WAR STRONG EFFORTS WERE THEREFORE MADE AT DE WITT'S INSTIGATION
1081-125237-0084_7302-86815-0054 HE WAS ABLE TO REACH THE PRIVATE EAR OF CROMWELL AND TO ENTER INTO CLANDESTINE NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY KNEW WELL THE HOPELESSNESS OF ANY ATTEMPT TO GET THE ASSENT OF THE STATES GENERAL TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION EVEN IN A SECRET ARTICLE
1081-125237-0085_6836-61804-0028 OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING ON THIS POINT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PROTECTOR GAVE THE ENVOY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED IF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ALONE WOULD AFFIRM A DECLARATION THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD NEVER BE APPOINTED STADHOLDER OR CAPTAIN GENERAL WHETHER THIS CONCESSION WAS OFFERED BY CROMWELL PROPRIO MOTU
1081-125237-0088_4214-7146-0072 THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FIRST SET TO WORK TO HAVE THE TREATY FROM WHICH THE EXCLUSION ARTICLE HAD BEEN CUT OUT RATIFIED RAPIDLY BY THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0089_7302-86815-0032 THE ESTATES ADJOURNED FOR A RECESS ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE PRESENTED THE TREATY TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0094_887-123290-0023 ADDRESSED TO THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND NOT AT THE MOMENT IN SESSION
1081-125237-0097_5463-39173-0063 TO THE ACT OF EXCLUSION CAME UPON THE ESTATES LIKE A THUNDER BOLT THE SUDDEN DEMAND CAUSED SOMETHING LIKE CONSTERNATION AND THE MEMBERS ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WITH THEIR PRINCIPALS BEFORE TAKING SO MOMENTOUS A DECISION THREE DAYS WERE GRANTED
1081-125237-0098_4014-186179-0037 BUT AS IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT PUBLICITY IT WAS SETTLED THAT ONLY THE BURGOMASTERS SHOULD BE CONSULTED AGAIN UNDER OATH OF SECRECY AT THE MEETING ON MAY FIRST
1081-125237-0099_6925-80680-0062 THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE PLACED IN HIS HANDS WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY WAS PEREMPTORY AND THREATENING UNLESS HE RECEIVED THE ACT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE TREATY AS NOT BINDING UPON HIM USING ALL HIS POWERS OF ADVOCACY
1081-125237-0101_40-121026-0033 AND OVERRULED THEIR PROTEST THE ACT WAS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN PASSED AND WAS ON MAY FIFTH SENT TO VAN BEVERNINGH AND NIEUWPOORT WITH INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO DELIVER IT UNTIL CIRCUMSTANCES COMPELLED THEM TO DO SO
1081-125237-0103_1069-133699-0015 EARLY IN JUNE A BRIBE INDUCED ONE OF DE WITT'S CLERKS TO BETRAY THE SECRET TO COUNT WILLIAM FREDERICK THE NEWS SOON SPREAD AND LOUD WAS THE OUTCRY OF THE ORANGE PARTISANS AND OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO AT ONCE ADDRESSED A REMONSTRANCE TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0106_6818-76332-0015 THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
1081-125237-0111_3112-9555-0073 AND THE RISK OF A RENEWAL OF THE WAR NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE PROTECTOR PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH A GUARANTEE OF SUCH DOUBTFUL VALIDITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD ADMIRATION FROM DE WITT'S MARVELLOUS DIPLOMATIC DEXTERITY
1081-125237-0112_8312-279791-0001 AND FROM THE SKILL AND COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ACHIEVED HIS END IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE BUT FOR THE COURSE OF DOUBLE DEALING AND CHICANERY BY WHICH HE TRIUMPHED THE ONLY DEFENCE THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS THAT THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY

1088-134315-0041_1098-133695-0057 DEFTLY HE LIFTED HIS LEFT HAND FROM THE POCKET CROOKED THE ELBOW BY SOME QUICK MANIPULATION AND THRUST THE BOOKS WHICH THE VALET MOST RELUCTANTLY HANDED TO HIM BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE HAD TAKEN THEM TELL MISTER KARA I WILL CALL AT MY OWN TIME

1088-134315-0054_3374-298025-0003 THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
1088-134315-0057_4214-7146-0078 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
1088-134318-0000_7113-86041-0050 CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
1088-134318-0002_3168-173564-0039 TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
1088-134318-0004_4898-28461-0019 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0005_1624-168623-0018 HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
1088-134318-0006_3830-12531-0003 HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
1088-134318-0009_3214-167606-0030 BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
1088-134318-0010_211-122425-0049 MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM
1088-134318-0011_150-126107-0033 YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR
1088-134318-0013_3214-167606-0035 THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
1088-134318-0014_3879-174923-0040 HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
1088-134318-0017_6415-116629-0021 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018_8108-280354-0007 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1098-133695-0001_1963-142393-0038 HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
1098-133695-0003_8063-274115-0022 AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
1098-133695-0004_5049-25947-0025 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
1098-133695-0005_5688-41232-0062 ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
1098-133695-0007_5192-19397-0075 SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
1098-133695-0008_1624-142933-0001 SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
1098-133695-0009_1455-134435-0015 THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
1098-133695-0010_6836-61803-0008 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0011_1081-125237-0092 WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
1098-133695-0012_103-1241-0029 WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
1098-133695-0015_8051-118101-0012 HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
1098-133695-0019_460-172359-0033 AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
1098-133695-0022_4014-186176-0007 SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
1098-133695-0023_3486-166424-0015 SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
1098-133695-0024_1363-135842-0033 AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
1098-133695-0028_2182-181173-0032 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0031_6181-216552-0087 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0035_6367-65536-0016 BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
1098-133695-0037_8747-293952-0052 WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
1098-133695-0038_7190-90542-0049 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0039_4018-107312-0015 LORD WARBURTON HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT HER SHE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE FIGURE RALPH WONDERED HOW THEIR NEIGHBOUR HAD FOUND IT OUT SO SOON AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ANOTHER PROOF OF HIS FRIEND'S HIGH ABILITIES
1098-133695-0042_8629-261140-0031 THAN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO BE SO WELL TREATED WHERE ONE HAD LEAST LOOKED FOR IT I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BLUE MORE BORED THAN FOR A WEEK BEFORE SHE CAME I HAD NEVER EXPECTED LESS THAT ANYTHING PLEASANT WOULD HAPPEN
1098-133695-0043_1594-135914-0051 A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
1098-133695-0046_7505-83618-0022 BUT SHE NEEDED THE KNOWING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HER THOUGH IT WAS CONTEMPLATIVE AND CRITICAL WAS NOT JUDICIAL HE SURVEYED THE EDIFICE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND ADMIRED IT GREATLY
1098-133695-0048_248-130644-0020 AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
1098-133695-0050_1594-135914-0106 THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
1098-133695-0051_2843-152918-0058 BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
1098-133695-0052_2159-179154-0035 FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
1098-133695-0053_7780-274562-0065 BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
1098-133695-0054_7367-86737-0088 BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
1098-133695-0055_302-123516-0005 ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
1098-133695-0056_1578-6379-0027 OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
1098-133695-0059_83-11691-0045 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
1098-133695-0060_6818-76332-0017 HER IMPRESSIONS WERE STILL SO FRESH AND SO QUICKLY RENEWED THAT THERE WAS AS YET HARDLY A HINT OF VACANCY IN THE VIEW BUT ISABEL HAD NEED TO REMIND HERSELF THAT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN HUMAN NATURE AND THAT HER FOREMOST HOPE IN COMING ABROAD
1098-133695-0061_1970-26100-0034 HAD BEEN THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHEN RALPH SAID TO HER AS HE HAD DONE SEVERAL TIMES I WONDER YOU FIND THIS ENDURABLE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
1098-133695-0064_6415-116629-0003 ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
1098-133695-0065_6880-216547-0109 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0067_5322-7680-0005 SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
1098-133695-0069_8238-283452-0015 OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
1098-133695-0070_669-129061-0084 CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
1098-133695-0072_332-128985-0026 WHO IF IT PLEASED HER TO HEAR IT SAID THAT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NUMEROUS WAS HAPPILY ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SUCH COMPLACENCY WAS NOT THE INDICATION OF A FEEBLE MIND INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN WHICH SHE EXCELLED
1098-133695-0073_3830-12535-0030 HAD AT LEAST THE ELEMENT OF HUMILITY THAT IT ALWAYS NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED BY PROOF LORD WARBURTON NOT ONLY SPENT THE NIGHT AT GARDENCOURT BUT HE WAS PERSUADED TO REMAIN OVER THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN THE SECOND DAY WAS ENDED
1098-133695-0074_6209-34601-0023 HE DETERMINED TO POSTPONE HIS DEPARTURE TILL THE MORROW DURING THIS PERIOD HE ADDRESSED MANY OF HIS REMARKS TO ISABEL WHO ACCEPTED THIS EVIDENCE OF HIS ESTEEM WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE SHE FOUND HERSELF LIKING HIM EXTREMELY
1098-133695-0075_83-3054-0016 THE FIRST IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE ON HER HAD HAD WEIGHT BUT AT THE END OF AN EVENING SPENT IN HIS SOCIETY SHE SCARCE FELL SHORT OF SEEING HIM THOUGH QUITE WITHOUT LURIDITY AS A HERO OF ROMANCE
1098-133695-0076_4813-248638-0009 WITH A QUICKENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE FELICITIES IT'S VERY NICE TO KNOW TWO SUCH CHARMING PEOPLE AS THOSE SHE SAID MEANING BY THOSE HER COUSIN AND HER COUSIN'S FRIEND IT MUST BE ADDED MOREOVER
1098-133695-0079_4397-15678-0022 THE OCCASION WORE TO HER SENSE A FESTIVE CHARACTER AND FEASTS WERE NOT IN THE HABIT OF TERMINATING SO EARLY SO WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT SHE REPLIED VERY SIMPLY NEED I GO DEAR AUNT I'LL COME UP IN HALF AN HOUR

1098-133695-0086_7367-86737-0060 MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
1098-133695-0088_5456-62043-0005 NODDED GOOD NIGHT AND WITHDREW ACCOMPANIED BY HER AUNT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS MOTHER THOUGH HE THOUGHT SHE WAS RIGHT ABOVE STAIRS THE TWO LADIES SEPARATED AT MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR ISABEL HAD SAID NOTHING ON HER WAY UP

1116-132847-0004_7447-91187-0050 THE GIRL WAS VERY UNHAPPY AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS AND FELT SORRY THAT SHE HAD NOT TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS SHE IMPLORED HOUARN NOT TO LEAVE HER BUT HE WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING THE BIRDS HE SAID CONTINUE FLYING UNTIL THEY REACH A FIELD OF CORN AND

1116-132847-0010_8051-295385-0005 AND HE WALKED ON TO PONT AVEN A PRETTY LITTLE TOWN BUILT ON THE BANK OF A RIVER HE WAS SITTING ON A BENCH OUTSIDE AN INN
1116-132847-0011_5789-57158-0032 AND THE MEN ANSWERED THAT IT WAS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE FAIRY THAT DWELT IN THE LAKE

1116-132847-0015_7794-295948-0023 AS SOON AS THE YOUNG MAN HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE HE PREPARED TO JUMP INTO THE LAKE AND SWIM TO SHORE BUT THE BIRD HAD GUESSED HIS INTENTIONS AND PLUNGED BENEATH THE WATER
1116-132847-0016_2911-15084-0007 THE PINK AND WHITE OF HER FACE REMINDED YOU OF THE SHELLS OF HER PALACE WHILE HER LONG BLACK HAIR WAS INTERTWINED WITH STRINGS OF CORAL AND HER DRESS OF GREEN SILK SEEMED FORMED OUT OF THE SEA AT THE SIGHT OF HER HOUARN STOPPED DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY

1116-132847-0034_2092-145706-0033 AND THE FOURTH AN IRON WITHOUT WAITING FOR ORDERS THEY SAT DOWN IN THE NEST AND CROSSING THEIR LEGS COMFORTABLY BEGAN TO PREPARE THE SUIT OF CLOTHES FOR BELLAH WITH ONE OF THE LEAVES OF THE CABBAGE THEY MADE HER A COAT
1116-132847-0035_1355-39947-0002 AND WITH IT IN HER HAND SHE STEPPED INTO THE BLUE BOAT WHICH CONDUCTED HER TO THE PALACE OF SHELLS THE GROAC'H SEEMED OVERJOYED TO SEE HER AND TOLD HER THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD SHE BEHELD SUCH A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
1116-132847-0039_5339-14133-0021 HER EYES FELL ON A GREEN FROG ON HIS KNEES BESIDE HER HIS LITTLE PAWS CROSSED OVER HIS LITTLE HEART BELLAH FELT AS IF FINGERS WERE TIGHTENING ROUND HER THROAT BUT SHE MANAGED TO CRY IS THIS YOU MY HOUARN IS THIS YOU IT IS I CROAKED THE LITTLE FROG
1116-132851-0000_3242-67153-0013 AND SHOES WITH SILVER BUCKLES THE WOMEN WERE ALL FILLED WITH ENVY BUT LITTLE CARED BARBAIK WHAT THEY MIGHT WHISPER BEHIND HER BACK AS LONG AS SHE KNEW THAT HER CLOTHES WERE FINER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S AND THAT SHE HAD MORE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER GIRL
1116-132851-0002_4137-11701-0048 ONE EVENING HE WAS BRINGING BACK HIS HORSES FROM THE FIELDS AND STOPPED AT A LITTLE LAKE ON THE WAY HOME TO LET THEM DRINK HE WAS TIRED WITH A LONG DAY'S WORK AND STOOD WITH HIS HAND ON THE MANE OF ONE OF THE ANIMALS WAITING TILL THEY HAD DONE AND THINKING ALL THE WHILE OF BARBAIK
1116-132851-0004_4680-16042-0021 IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
1116-132851-0005_7859-102519-0006 AND EVEN WHICH IS MUCH HARDER BE INVISIBLE IF I WANT TO THEN SHOW YOURSELF TO ME IN THE SHAPE IN WHICH YOUR FAMILY GENERALLY APPEAR REPLIED JEGU CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH AND THE FROG JUMPED ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE HORSES AND CHANGED INTO A LITTLE DWARF ALL DRESSED IN GREEN
1116-132851-0007_7302-86814-0010 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
1116-132851-0008_1334-135589-0021 JEGU DECLARED THAT NOTHING COULD BE EASIER AND THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT HE THANKED THE DWARF HEARTILY AND LED HIS HORSES BACK TO THE FARM NEXT MORNING WAS A HOLIDAY AND BARBAIK WAS AWAKE EARLIER THAN USUAL
1116-132851-0009_5104-33407-0049 AS SHE WISHED TO GET THROUGH HER WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BE READY TO START FOR A DANCE WHICH WAS TO BE HELD SOME DISTANCE OFF SHE WENT FIRST TO THE COW HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER DUTY TO KEEP CLEAN BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND FRESH STRAW PUT DOWN
1116-132851-0012_8975-270782-0017 INDEED BARBAIK HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR IT TO BE SATISFIED IF THE WIND WAS COLD OR THE SUN WAS HOT AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO OUT LEST HER COMPLEXION SHOULD BE SPOILT SHE NEED ONLY TO RUN DOWN TO THE SPRING CLOSE BY AND SAY SOFTLY I SHOULD LIKE MY CHURNS TO BE FULL
1116-132851-0013_1578-140045-0021 AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
1116-132851-0014_6000-55211-0037 WHY AM I NOT ALREADY BACK FROM MORLAIX WITH MY MILK POT EMPTY MY BUTTER BOWL INSIDE IT A POUND OF WILD CHERRIES ON MY WOODEN PLATE AND THE MONEY I HAVE GAINED IN MY APRON POCKET AND IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE GOT UP LO AND BEHOLD
1116-132851-0015_1334-135589-0082 AND SIX NEW PIECES OF SILVER IN THE POCKET OF HER APRON AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALL THIS WAS OWING TO JEGU AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN IN HER THOUGHTS WHEN THINGS HAD REACHED THIS PASS THE BROWNIE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE HAD BETTER ASK BARBAIK TO MARRY HIM
1116-132851-0017_1363-135842-0006 AND SHE COULD SLEEP EVERY MORNING TILL BREAKFAST TIME JUST LIKE A YOUNG LADY AND AS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
1116-132851-0018_6078-54013-0076 SHE WOULD WEAR THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES THAT CAME WHEN SHE WISHED FOR THEM
1116-132851-0022_1246-124548-0048 AND AFTER RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING SHE BEGGED THE BROWNIE TO GET HER A HORSE TO RIDE THERE TO HER GREAT JOY HE CONSENTED BIDDING HER SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE DWARFS AND TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED
1116-132851-0027_6437-66172-0026 WHEN ALL WAS READY THE DWARFS IN NEW GREEN SUITS CAME BUSTLING IN VERY HAPPY AND MERRY AND TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE BUT IN A MOMENT THEY ALL SPRANG UP WITH A CRY AND RAN AWAY SCREAMING FOR BARBAIK HAD PLACED PANS OF HOT COALS UNDER THEIR FEET AND ALL THEIR POOR LITTLE TOES WERE BURNT
1116-132851-0028_2007-132570-0014 YOU WON'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY SHE SAID SMILING GRIMLY TO HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH LARGE POTS OF WATER WHICH THEY POURED ON THE FIRE THEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ROUND IT SINGING WICKED TRAITRESS
1116-137572-0002_6415-111615-0011 UNLESS THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE THIS NEW JOINT ENTERPRISE IS GOING TO MEAN MORE TO EACH OF THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE EVER CAN BEFORE THEM IS A CLEAR ROAD NOT TO HAPPINESS AS THEY MAY BELIEVE BUT TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GAINING HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0004_2416-152139-0024 BUT THE FIRST DAYS OF MARRIAGE BRING OUT A DIFFERENT SET OF FEELINGS THOSE THAT COME WHEN ONE HAS DEFINITELY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF ANYTHING THAT BEFORE WAS ONLY PROMISED AT FIRST THE EMOTIONS SEEM TO STAND STILL THIS IS THE LONG COVETED MOMENT THEN ONE BEGINS TO APPRAISE
1116-137572-0005_6925-80680-0026 IS THE OBJECT OF ONE'S WISHES AS DESIRABLE AS ONE HAD EXPECTED BECAUSE REALITY RARELY MEASURES UP TO IMAGINATION THE FIRST ANSWER IS ALMOST BOUND TO BE NO THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND THE FIRST EMOTION TENDS TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT
1116-137572-0006_1898-145702-0007 REGARDLESS OF HAZY BUT OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS AND THE OBJECT POSSESSED WILL MORE THAN LIKELY TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE IMAGINATION PICTURED KNOWING THAT A FLEETING SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IS NOT PECULIAR TO ONE'S OWN MARRIAGE BUT LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ALL
1116-137572-0008_83-11691-0016 AND DISADVANTAGES WITH WHICH THE COUPLE ENTER MARRIAGE THESE TRAITS CANNOT BE CHANGED OVERNIGHT NOR IS IT NECESSARY OR AT ALL WISE THAT THEY SHOULD BE JOHN ATTRACTS MARY AND SHE APPEALS TO HIM BECAUSE THE PERSONALITY OF EACH ONE IS WHAT IT IS
1116-137572-0011_6476-57446-0070 THIS IS WHAT THEY MUST GUARD AGAINST WHILE LOVE IS STILL THE MOVING FORCE OF THEIR LIVES THEY MUST STUDY THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE DUE TO COME TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE BESET BY THEM IS TO BEG FOR TROUBLE
1116-137572-0012_8629-261139-0076 IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THEIR PROBLEMS THEY MUST REALIZE FIRST THAT THEY CANNOT STUMBLE UPON MARRIED HAPPINESS THAT THEY MUST POSSESS AND CULTIVATE A POSITIVE WILL TO SUCCEED
1116-137572-0014_6019-3185-0071 INEVITABLE IN THE COMING TOGETHER OF ANY TWO PERSONS INTENSIFIED WHEN THOSE TWO PERSONS ARE AS DIFFERENT AS A MAN AND A WOMAN AND UNAVOIDABLE FOR TWO COMMITTED TO A LIFETIME TOGETHER IN THE CLOSE QUARTERS OF MARRIAGE TWO
1116-137572-0017_4441-76250-0001 IN EITHER SITUATION THE PARTICULAR COUPLE INVOLVED HAVE TO WEIGH DELICATELY THE EFFECT ON THEIR JOINT ENTERPRISE OF THE CONFLICTING COURSES OF ACTION MUCH AS MARY MAY CRAVE A CHILD OR A CAR
1116-137572-0022_445-123857-0021 NO MAN CAN AFFORD TO BE CRIPPLED FOR LIFE BY LETTING HIS WIFE SWADDLE HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AS SOME MOTHERS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEIR OWN GLORIFICATION A WOMAN'S FEELING THAT SHE WILL BE EMOTIONALLY GRATIFIED BY MAKING A SACRIFICE DOES NOT PROVE THAT ASIDE FROM HER MOMENTARY PLEASURE
1116-137572-0023_2196-170151-0005 ANY INDIVIDUAL WOMAN MAY WAVER BETWEEN A CRAVING FOR SELF SACRIFICE AND A REPUGNANCE TO THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT THIS CHANGEABLENESS CAN MAKE HER FEEL RESENTFUL AFTER SHE HAS GIVEN IN TO HER HUSBAND ALL THIS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MAKING DECISIONS
1116-137572-0025_374-180299-0036 AND THE EFFORT TO DO SO TO PLEASE THE PARTNER IS LIABLE TO RESULT IN A TOPHEAVY HYPOCRISY A SUPERSTRUCTURE CALCULATED TO IMPRESS THE OBSERVER BUT BUILT ON A SHAKY FOUNDATION OF CHAOS
1116-137572-0026_3214-167606-0024 A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOR EASILY TO MATCH ITS ENVIRONMENT OR TEMPER OF THE MOMENT BUT A HUMAN BEING'S MORE LASTING CHANGE IS NOT SO READILY MADE EACH MARRIAGE PARTNER MUST BE PROUD OF THE OTHER AND LET THE OTHER CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HER
1116-137572-0029_3983-5371-0034 USING THE MATE FOR RELIEF AS IN NAGGING WHINING CRYING OR GRUMBLING IS TABOO IF YOU ARE TIRED OR IRRITABLE YOU CAN REST OR EXERCISE FOR RESTORATION AS IN THE DAYS BEFORE MARRIAGE
1116-137572-0030_2989-138028-0006 AND DRY UP THE SOURCE OF REFRESHMENT YOU ARE TRYING TO TAP FATIGUE AND NERVOUSNESS EXPRESSED BREED FATIGUE AND NERVOUSNESS IN A SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE FOUR TOO GREAT CONCENTRATION IS TO BE AVOIDED
1116-137572-0033_200-124139-0003 THOUGH MORE EASILY DISLODGED AND SELDOM STRIKING SO DEEP FRIENDS OLD AND NEW HAVE A FUNCTION IN RELIEVING THE OVERCLOSE CONCERN OF ONE MARRIAGE PARTNER WITH THE OTHER IF THEY ARE TO PLAY THEIR FULL PART IN PREVENTING OVERCONCENTRATION
1116-137572-0040_6081-41997-0019 ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOMENT THAT IS DUE TO COME MAY SEEM EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO ARE SLIPPING SOON OR LATE YOU FIND THAT SOME FAMILIAR MANNERISM OF YOUR SPOUSE DISPLEASES YOU IT MAY BE A SLIGHT UNCOUTHNESS AT TABLE
1116-137572-0042_254-12312-0002 YOU REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE YOU ONCE THOUGHT YOU LOVED AND WONDER PANIC STRICKEN HOW YOU CAN KEEP THIS LOVE FROM DYING AS THOSE OTHER LOVES DID THIS IS PROBABLY AN ALMOST UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE MARKING NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF LOVE
1116-137572-0045_3240-131231-0075 SEVEN THERE CAN BE NO NARROWING OF MARRIAGE TO MERE SEX ADJUSTMENT
1116-137572-0046_3526-176653-0049 AND THE TWO PERSONS HAVE TO WORK OUT A COMMON LIFE THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM OVER AND ABOVE THE PLEASURE THEY MAY TAKE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AS A CONTINUING PART OF THIS LIFE ADJUSTMENT SEX ADJUSTMENT CAN DEVELOP INTO A PERMANENT FACTOR OF MARRIED HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0047_2436-2476-0024 BUT WITHOUT THE LARGER ADJUSTMENT THE PARTIAL ADJUSTMENT CANNOT BE MADE IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL AND ENDURING FORM IN THE SEX LIFE IN MARRIAGE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ASSOCIATION EACH PARTNER WINS BY CONSIDERING THE OTHER BEFORE THE SELF
1116-137572-0048_3235-11599-0014 BUT INSTEAD A COMPLETE TRUST IN EACH OTHER ONE WHO PRIDES HIMSELF OR HERSELF ON HAVING TO BE HANDLED WITH GLOVES HAS A GREAT DEAL OF GROWING UP TO DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE MARRIAGE CRY BABYING IS NO MORE HELPFUL IN MARRIAGE THAN IN BUSINESS OR SOCIAL LIFE
1116-137572-0049_6147-34605-0039 IN THE HEALTHY MARRIAGE THIS SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE WILL SOON GIVE WAY TO ANGER WHICH IN TURN MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF A DASH OF COLD WATER IN THE FACE OF THE OVERSENSITIVE ONE HELPING HIM OR HER TO BUCK UP AND BEHAVE LIKE AN ADULT IN THE UNHEALTHY MARRIAGE SYMPATHY WILL GROW INTO PITY
1116-137572-0052_8095-274348-0012 IF THE EXPRESSION OF ANGER IS TO HAVE ITS PROPER STIMULATIVE EFFECT IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED BUT RARELY AND THEN IN SMALL DOSES MORE HAS A PARALYZING EFFECT ON THE RECIPIENT
1116-137572-0054_6880-216547-0080 AS THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY THEY ARE AWARE OF INCREASING DISSATISFACTION THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE UNADAPTED TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE AFRAID TO LEAVE THE KNOWN PLEASURES OF THEIR FIRST YOUTH FOR THE UNGUESSED SATISFACTIONS OF MATURITY SO THEY TRY TO STAND STILL

118-124588-0000_1624-168623-0029 MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
118-124588-0003_8238-274553-0066 SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
118-124588-0004_150-126112-0003 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
118-124588-0007_7447-91187-0038 OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
118-124588-0008_6147-34607-0027 BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
118-124588-0010_8063-274115-0023 THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
118-124588-0011_7505-83618-0024 AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
118-124588-0012_8312-279790-0043 AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
118-124588-0014_3112-9555-0077 THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
118-124588-0015_7190-90542-0030 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY

118-47824-0000_3723-171631-0013 CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
118-47824-0001_8465-246942-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0003_60-121082-0076 THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
118-47824-0010_3699-19402-0013 I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
118-47824-0014_198-209-0019 WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
118-47824-0017_6848-252322-0012 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH

118-47824-0023_3168-173565-0023 GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
118-47824-0031_7447-91187-0018 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0034_3879-173592-0037 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0036_6019-3185-0016 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037_2817-142371-0034 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER

1235-135884-0010_5339-14134-0004 THE UNFORTUNATE MOTHER OF MY SON I BOUND HER BUT AS I WAS GOING TO SACRIFICE HER SHE BELLOWED PITEOUSLY AND I COULD PERCEIVE TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES THIS SEEMED TO ME VERY EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135884-0011_1841-159771-0034 AND FINDING MYSELF MOVED WITH COMPASSION I COULD NOT FIND IN MY HEART TO GIVE HER A BLOW BUT ORDERED MY FARMER TO GET ME ANOTHER MY WIFE WHO WAS PRESENT WAS ENRAGED AT MY TENDERNESS
1235-135884-0013_8468-294887-0019 AND COMBATING MY COMPASSION WHICH SUSPENDED THE SACRIFICE WAS GOING TO GIVE HER THE FATAL BLOW WHEN THE VICTIM REDOUBLING HER TEARS AND BELLOWING DISARMED ME A SECOND TIME

1246-124550-0004_3436-172171-0016 NOT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO KENNICOTT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE OR MIGHT DO WAS A RELIEF WHICH MADE UP FOR THE OFFICE WEARINESS SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER ONE HALF OF A MARRIAGE
1246-124550-0006_118-47824-0086 THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0007_6181-216552-0003 WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS OPEN TO VIEW WHERE EVERY PERSON WAS BUT TOO EASY TO MEET WHERE THERE WERE NO SECRET GATES OPENING UPON MOORS OVER WHICH ONE MIGHT WALK BY MOSS DEADENED PATHS TO STRANGE HIGH ADVENTURES IN AN ANCIENT GARDEN
1246-124550-0008_1963-142776-0019 AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
1246-124550-0011_2843-152918-0077 WERE THE MEMBERS OF THE TINCOMB METHODIST CHURCH A VAST RED BRICK TABERNACLE VIDA SHERWIN HAD GIVEN HER A LETTER TO AN EARNEST WOMAN WITH EYE GLASSES PLAID SILK WAIST AND A BELIEF IN BIBLE CLASSES WHO INTRODUCED HER TO THE PASTOR AND THE

1246-124550-0014_6081-42010-0036 PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
1246-124550-0015_2007-132570-0048 ALWAYS SHE WAS TO PERCEIVE IN WASHINGTON AS DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IN NEW YORK OR LONDON A THICK STREAK OF MAIN STREET THE CAUTIOUS DULLNESS OF A GOPHER PRAIRIE APPEARED IN BOARDING HOUSES WHERE LADYLIKE BUREAU CLERKS
1246-124550-0016_3607-135982-0033 ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THE CAPTAIN INTRODUCED HER TO THE SECRETARY OF A CONGRESSMAN A CYNICAL YOUNG WIDOW WITH MANY ACQUAINTANCES IN THE NAVY THROUGH HER CAROL MET COMMANDERS AND MAJORS NEWSPAPERMEN
1246-124550-0018_7278-104730-0000 INDEED HER ONLY RECOGNIZED POSITION WAS AS AN ABLE ADDRESSER OF ENVELOPES BUT SHE WAS CASUALLY ADOPTED BY THIS FAMILY OF FRIENDLY WOMEN WHO WHEN THEY WERE NOT BEING MOBBED OR ARRESTED TOOK DANCING LESSONS OR WENT PICNICKING UP THE CHESAPEAKE CANAL
1246-124550-0022_8975-270782-0046 THE PRESENCE OF HUGH MADE HER FEEL TEMPORARY SOME DAY OH SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OPEN FIELDS AND THE RIGHT TO CLIMB ABOUT HAY LOFTS BUT THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE EMINENT AMONG THESE SCOFFING ENTHUSIASTS
1246-124550-0023_1867-154075-0025 DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
1246-124550-0024_307-127535-0032 THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
1246-124550-0025_8419-286667-0005 KENNICOTT HAD ASSERTED THAT THE VILLAGER'S LACK OF COURTESY IS DUE TO HIS POVERTY WE'RE NO MILLIONAIRE DUDES HE BOASTED YET THESE ARMY AND NAVY MEN THESE BUREAU EXPERTS AND ORGANIZERS OF MULTITUDINOUS LEAGUES
1246-124550-0026_5339-14133-0050 THAT INSTITUTION IS RESERVED FOR MEN LIKE KENNICOTT WHO AFTER DEVOTING FIFTY YEARS TO PUTTING ASIDE A STAKE INCONTINENTLY INVEST THE STAKE IN SPURIOUS OIL STOCKS
1246-124550-0027_8465-246943-0008 SHE FOUND THE SAME FAITH NOT ONLY IN GIRLS ESCAPED FROM DOMESTICITY BUT ALSO IN DEMURE OLD LADIES WHO TRAGICALLY DEPRIVED OF ESTEEMED HUSBANDS AND HUGE OLD HOUSES
1246-124550-0030_6818-76332-0052 DRIPPING SOOT FROM EAVES AND DOORWAY ROLLED OUT SMOKE IN GREASY COILS OTHER TOWNS SHE CAME TO KNOW BY ANECDOTE A PRAIRIE VILLAGE WHERE THE WIND BLEW ALL DAY LONG AND THE MUD WAS TWO FEET THICK IN SPRING AND IN SUMMER
1246-124550-0033_909-131044-0020 A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
1246-124550-0034_1355-39947-0063 THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
1246-124550-0036_1363-139304-0026 BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE
1246-124550-0037_5867-48852-0007 THAT AMIABLE CONTEMPT CALLED POISE HER GLIMPSE OF TASKS INVOLVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND A SCORE OF NATIONS REDUCED MAIN STREET FROM BLOATED IMPORTANCE TO ITS ACTUAL PETTINESS SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN BE QUITE SO AWED BY THE POWER
1246-124550-0038_2391-145015-0097 SHE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF AN IMPERSONAL ATTITUDE SAW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS TOUCHILY PERSONAL AS MAUD DYER AND WHY SHE BEGAN TO ASK DID SHE RAGE AT INDIVIDUALS NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE ENEMIES
1246-124550-0039_118-47824-0069 AND THEY MOST AFFLICT THE DISCIPLES WHO THE MOST GENEROUSLY SERVE THEM
1246-135815-0003_302-123523-0019 SO HE SELDOM GOES FAR FROM HIS OWN DOORSTEP PETER LEFT HIM GRUMBLING AND GROWLING AND CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH HE KNEW THAT JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD NOT DARE DISOBEY OLD MOTHER NATURE
1246-135815-0004_4859-22176-0001 SURE ENOUGH THE NEXT MORNING JOHNNY CHUCK CAME WADDLING THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST JUST AS OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS ABOUT TO OPEN SCHOOL HE DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL HAPPY AND HE DIDN'T REPLY AT ALL TO THE GREETINGS OF THE OTHERS

1246-135815-0013_7190-90543-0008 DOWN A LITTLE WAY THE TUNNEL GREW SMALLER AND THEN REMAINED THE SAME SIZE ALL THE REST OF THE WAY WAY DOWN AT THE FARTHER END WAS A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH SOME GRASS IN IT THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OTHER LITTLE ROOMS
1246-135815-0014_5678-43301-0000 AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
1246-135815-0016_2436-2477-0013 AND ONCE IN A WHILE ONLY ONE BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY SAFE

1263-139804-0000_4018-103416-0002 SUSTAINS THE SHORTEST LIVED HUMAN BEINGS OF OUR UNIVERSE IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY OF THE CREATURES REACH MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF AGE ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARDS OF TIME
1263-139804-0001_198-129977-0027 THEY ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WE AND RELATIVELY MUCH LIGHTER IN WEIGHT ALL THE PERIODS OF PHYSICAL GROWTH ARE CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED CHILDREN WALK FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS AFTER BIRTH
1263-139804-0002_1455-138263-0050 AND ARE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING REGULAR INSTRUCTION AT THE AGE OF FIVE MONTHS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THIS SPHERE WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE WE WILL CALL BRIEF
1263-139804-0004_19-227-0047 ON THIS WORLD OF BRIEF ALL VEGETABLES MATURE IN PERIODS SO SHORT THAT ONE MARVELS WHEN HE HEARS IT THINK OF CEREALS REACHING MATURITY IN SEVEN OR EIGHT OF OUR DAYS OR DURING ONE DAY OF BRIEF
1263-139804-0006_3440-171009-0063 IF YOU WERE PERMITTED TO LOOK UPON THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THIS INCREDIBLE WORLD YOUR FIRST SENSATION WOULD BE DIZZINESS NOT TO MENTION THE WEIRDNESS OF ALL SIGHTS THAT WOULD CONFRONT YOU AT EVERY TURN
1263-139804-0007_2289-152254-0020 AND IF BY LEASE OF STRENGTH THEY PASS ON TOWARD AN AGE OF FOUR YEARS IT IS BUT AN EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXCEPTIONAL VITALITY IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG LIFE OF SIXTY OR EIGHTY YEARS IS CROWDED INTO A NARROW COMPASS OF FOUR YEARS
1263-139804-0009_8312-279790-0011 THERE NEED NOT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NEWS TELEGRAPHED EACH HOUR THE GOVERNMENT VERIFIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL REPORTS BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSMITTED THERE ARE INDEED SOME ADVANTAGES IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH EACH HOME UNDER ITS CARE
1263-139804-0012_3857-180923-0020 NEITHER THE MEN WOMEN NOR CHILDREN SEEM TO SEEK THIS MEANS FOR SELF BEAUTIFYING THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BEAUTY OF CHARACTER HAS A RADIANCE MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THE FLASH OF OPALS OR THE LUSTER OF SILKS THEIR GARMENTS PARTAKE OF THE LOOSE FLOWING ORDER
1263-139804-0014_3240-131232-0030 TRANSPORTATION THE METHODS OF TRAVELING ARE SO CONTRARY TO OUR CONCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES THAT I ALMOST FORBEAR TO ATTEMPT ANY DESCRIPTION
1263-139804-0016_5750-100289-0051 ALTHOUGH THE CARS RUN ON WHEELS THE CAR IS RAISED IN A SHAFT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET AND THEN BY GRAVITY IT DASHES TWO OR MORE MILES ACCORDING TO THE LAY OF THE LAND TRAVERSED THEN ANOTHER RISE MORE OR LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET IS EXPERIENCED
1263-139804-0018_2910-131096-0071 THE POWER OF STEAM HAS NEVER BEEN UTILIZED NO GENIUS OF ALL THIS ACTIVE WORLD OF BRIEF EVER CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT ALMOST UNLIMITED POWER LIES WRAPPED UP IN THIN VAPORY WATER BUT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL GASEOUS OIL
1263-139804-0019_289-121665-0037 AND HAVE LEARNED TO PUT IT TO WORK SO THAT IT IS THE MAIN FORCE EMPLOYED IN HOISTING AND ALL OTHER PURPOSES WHERE POWER IS REQUIRED NOTHING LIKE A TRAVELING LOCOMOTIVE HAS EVER BEEN MADE ALTHOUGH I LEARNED THAT A BRIGHT WIZARD WAS EXPERIMENTING
1263-139804-0020_5514-19192-0038 AND THAT HE PROPHESIED GREAT CHANGES WHEN HIS GAS PROPELLED VEHICLE WAS PERFECTED THINK OF HOW MUCH VALUE AN ORDINARY CITIZEN OF OUR WORLD WOULD BE TO THESE BRIEFITES IF HE COULD STEP UPON THEIR WORLD AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM CONCERNING THE MAGIC WONDERS OF STEAM
1263-139804-0024_2952-410-0012 VERY INTRICATE AND ELABORATE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BY THESE PEOPLE OF A FEW YEARS THEY ARE INFERIOR TO US IN A HUNDRED WAYS IN THE BROAD FIELDS OF MANUFACTURE AND INVENTION THEY LAG A LONG DISTANCE IN THE REAR THIS IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THEIR LACK OF TIME
1263-139804-0026_5561-41615-0011 THE MOST FAITHFUL TRANSLATION OF THIS WORD INTO OUR LANGUAGE WOULD BE GOD AFFLUENCE KERM CHER OR GOD BREATH APPEARED UPON BRIEF FULL GROWN
1263-139804-0028_6437-66172-0007 ONLY THERE IS MUCH LESS VARIETY THAN IS FOUND AMONGST US KERM CHER SET UP A NEW REIGN AND ACCEPTED A TEMPORAL THRONE FOR A SEASON HE FINALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS AMBASSADORSHIP WOULD SOON CEASE
1263-141777-0005_481-123720-0085 THEN THE MARKS ON THE GROUND AT THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN AND THE L B WERE HERE JUST AS HE REMEMBERED BUT NOT FAR FROM THE SMALL SHIP HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE A CAMPSITE WITH A SHELTER FASHIONED OUT OF SPALLS AND VINES
1263-141777-0007_4018-107338-0018 THOUGH IT WAS BALLED IN UPON ITSELF HE WAS SURE THE CREATURE WAS FULLY AS LARGE AS HE AND THE MENACING CLAWS SUGGESTED IT WAS A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WHEN IT MADE NO MOVE TO FOLLOW HIM
1263-141777-0008_6476-57446-0069 RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
1263-141777-0012_6437-66173-0054 THE NOSE WAS A BLACK PERFECTLY ROUNDED TUBE JUTTING AN INCH OR SO BEYOND THE CHEEK SURFACE GROTESQUE ALIEN AND TERRIFYING IT MADE NO HOSTILE MOVE AND SINCE IT HAD NOT TURNED ITS HEAD HE COULD NOT BE SURE IT HAD EVEN SIGHTED HIM
1263-141777-0013_460-172359-0022 BUT IT KNEW HE WAS THERE HE WAS CERTAIN OF THAT AND WAS WAITING FOR WHAT AS THE LONG SECONDS CRAWLED BY RYNCH BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT WAITING FOR HIM HEARTENED HE PULLED AT THE VINE LOOP
1263-141777-0014_3664-178366-0031 CLIMBED BACK INTO THE TREE MINUTES LATER HE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO OF THE BEASTS WAITING QUIETLY ABOUT THE CAMP AND THAT THEIR SENTRY LINE RAN BETWEEN HIM AND THE CLEARING OF THE L B HE WITHDREW FARTHER INTO THE WOOD
1263-141777-0015_311-124404-0095 INTENT UPON FINDING A DETOUR WHICH WOULD BRING HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN LANDS NOW HE WANTED TO JOIN FORCES WITH HIS OWN KIND WHETHER THOSE MEN WERE POTENTIAL ENEMIES OR NOT AS TIME PASSED THE BEASTS CLOSED ABOUT THE CLEARING OF THE CAMP
1263-141777-0018_7800-283492-0039 AND GROUPED NOT TOO FAR FROM ITS LANDING RAMP A COLLECTION OF BUBBLE TENTS A FIRE BURNED IN THEIR MIDST AND MEN WERE MOVING ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE WAS FREE FROM THE WOOD AND ITS WATCHERS AND HAD COME SO NEAR TO HIS GOAL
1263-141777-0019_4195-186237-0000 RYNCH WAS CURIOUSLY RELUCTANT TO DO THE SENSIBLE THING TO RISE OUT OF CONCEALMENT AND WALK UP TO THAT FIRE TO CLAIM RESCUE BY HIS OWN KIND THE MAN HE SOUGHT STOOD BY THE FIRE
1263-141777-0020_19-227-0006 SHRUGGING HIS ARMS INTO A WEBBING HARNESS WHICH BROUGHT A BOX AGAINST HIS CHEST HAVING MADE THAT FAST HE PICKED UP A NEEDLER BY ITS SLING BY THEIR GESTURES THE OTHERS WERE ARGUING WITH HIM BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAME ON
1263-141777-0021_4853-27670-0031 THAT IDEA MADE SENSE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD LET THE OTHER PAST HIM FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND UNTIL HE WAS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE CAMP SO THAT HIS FRIENDS COULD NOT INTERFERE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A MEETING
1263-141777-0024_460-172357-0018 BUT THEY NO LONGER GATHERED IN STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIGHT HIS PRESENCE NOW HE COULD SEE THEY DRIFTED ABOUT THE VEGETATION ABOUT THE LOG WHERE THE MAN SAT ABOUT ROCKS AND REEDS ONLY THEY WERE THICKER ABOUT THE STRANGER AS IF HIS BODY WERE A MAGNET
1263-141777-0028_3240-131232-0005 THEIR COURSE PARALLEL TO THE WOODS BROUGHT THEM AT LAST TO A SECOND STREAM THE SIZE OF A RIVER INTO WHICH THE FIRST CREEK EMPTIED HERE THE OTHER SETTLED DOWN BETWEEN TWO ROCKS WITH EVERY INDICATION OF REMAINING THERE FOR A PERIOD
1263-141777-0031_3240-131232-0003 WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE OTHER'S EXPEDITION WAS HE GOING TO USE THE OPEN CUT THROUGH WHICH THE RIVER RAN AS A WAY OF PENETRATING THE WOODED COUNTRY NOW RYNCH CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM FROM HIS OWN ANGLE THE MAN FROM THE SPACER HAD MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS TRAIL
1263-141777-0034_3240-131232-0036 THAT SOUND OF SNARLING SPITTING HATE ENDED IN MID CRY AS RYNCH CRAWLED TO THE RIVER BANK THE MAN FROM THE SPACER CAMP HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF A THREE PRONG ATTACK FROM A FEMALE AND HER CUBS
1263-141777-0037_4088-158077-0075 WALKED WITH SLOW DELIBERATION DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK THE TRAPPED PRISONER HAD SHIED HALFWAY AROUND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS TO FIND A FIRMER GRIP ON SOME ROCK LARGE AND HEAVY ENOUGH TO ANCHOR HIM AFTER HIS FIRST STARTLED CRY HE HAD MADE NO SOUND
1263-141777-0038_8838-298546-0034 BUT NOW AS HE SIGHTED RYNCH HIS EYES WIDENED AND HIS LIPS PARTED THE BOX ON HIS CHEST CAUGHT ON A STONE HE HAD DRAGGED TO HIM IN A DESPERATE TRY FOR SUPPORT
1263-141777-0039_302-123516-0030 THERE WAS A SPITTING OF SPARKS AND THE STRANGER WORKED FRANTICALLY AT THE BUCKLE OF THE WEBBING HARNESS TO LOOSEN IT AND TOSS THE WHOLE THING FROM HIM THE BOX STRUCK ONE OF THE DEAD WATER CATS FLASHED AS FUR AND FLESH WERE SINGED
1263-141777-0040_1992-141719-0035 RYNCH WATCHED DISPASSIONATELY BEFORE HE CAUGHT THE NEEDLER JERKING IT AWAY FROM THE PRISONER THE MAN EYED HIM STEADILY AND HIS EXPRESSION DID NOT ALTER EVEN WHEN RYNCH SWUNG THE OFF WORLD WEAPON TO CENTER ITS SIGHTS ON THE LATE OWNER
1263-141777-0041_118-47824-0020 SUPPOSE RYNCH'S VOICE WAS RUSTY SOUNDING IN HIS OWN EARS WE TALK NOW THE MAN NODDED

1334-135589-0018_83-11691-0030 EXCEPT IN INQUIRING AFTER HER HEALTH AND SENDING HIS RESPECTS IT MAY BE YEARS BEFORE I SEE HER AGAIN THOUGHT EDWARD AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN

1334-135589-0070_19-227-0054 MISTER HEATHERSTONE WHO LED HIS DAUGHTER PATIENCE THAT THEY HAD NOT PERCEIVED HIM WAS EVIDENT INDEED HER EYES WERE NOT RAISED ONCE FROM THE NATURAL TIMIDITY FELT BY A YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY
1334-135589-0071_254-127705-0035 EDWARD HALF CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE MIGHT GAZE UPON HER WITHOUT RESERVE
1334-135589-0073_226-131533-0006 THERE WAS THE SAME PENSIVE SWEET EXPRESSION IN HER FACE WHICH HAD ALTERED LITTLE BUT THE BEAUTIFUL ROUNDED ARMS
1334-135589-0076_4297-13006-0016 I TRUST THAT THE DAUGHTER WILL OFTEN GRACE OUR COURT PATIENCE MADE NO REPLY BUT PASSED ON AND SOON AFTERWARD EDWARD LOST SIGHT OF HER IN THE CROWD
1334-135589-0083_2182-150130-0010 AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU
1334-135589-0084_2092-145706-0046 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU SAY SO HUMPHREY HAVE WE NOT BEEN ATTACHED FROM OUR YOUTH YES IT WAS A YOUTHFUL PASSION I GRANT BUT RECOLLECT NOTHING CAME OF IT AND YEARS HAVE PASSED AWAY
1334-135589-0085_328-129766-0016 IT IS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE YOU QUITTED THE FOREST AND IN YOUR LETTERS TO MISTER HEATHERSTONE YOU MADE NO REMARK UPON WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND PATIENCE SINCE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER CORRESPONDED OR SENT ANY MESSAGES
1334-135589-0087_1034-121119-0045 AND IT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED EDWARD MOURNFULLY WELL
1334-135589-0088_8238-283452-0045 YOU KNOW HUMPHREY HOW MANY OFFERS PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HAS HAD AND HAS EVERY DAY I MAY SAY
1334-135589-0089_4898-28461-0049 TO A PROUD BROTHER OF MINE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE HER IT MAY BE SO EDITH REPLIED HUMPHREY WOMEN ARE RIDDLES I ONLY ARGUED UPON THE COMMON SENSE OF THE THING MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN
1334-135589-0092_40-121026-0003 I WAS ABOUT TO CALL UPON HIM BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU FIRST I WILL GO WITH YOU I HAVE NOT DONE HIM JUSTICE REPLIED EDWARD AND YET I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HIM SAY NOTHING BUT MEET HIM CORDIALLY
1334-135589-0094_1926-143879-0017 WHAT MUST HE THINK OF MY NOT HAVING CALLED UPON HIM NOTHING YOU HOLD A PLACE AT COURT YOU MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS IN LONDON AS YOU HAVE NEVER MET HIM YOUR COMING WITH ME WILL MAKE IT APPEAR SO
1334-135589-0095_7078-271888-0035 TELL HIM THAT I HAVE JUST MADE KNOWN TO YOU HIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL I FEAR HOWEVER HUMPHREY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND EDITH WRONG AS REGARDS HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0096_5678-43302-0010 NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
1334-135589-0097_1069-133709-0009 ON MISTER HEATHERSTONE REPEATING TO HIM HIS INTENTIONS RELATIVE TO ARNWOOD EXPRESSED HIS SENSE OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT SIMPLY ADDING YOU MAY THINK ME IMPETUOUS SIR BUT I TRUST YOU WILL BELIEVE ME GRATEFUL
1334-135589-0098_7190-90542-0018 PATIENCE COLORED UP AND TREMBLED WHEN EDWARD FIRST SAW HER EDWARD DID NOT REFER TO THE PAST FOR SOME TIME AFTER THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HE WOOED HER AGAIN AND WON HER
1334-135589-0101_103-1241-0008 SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE OTHER PERSONAGES WHO HAVE APPEARED IN OUR LITTLE HISTORY HUMPHREY MUST TAKE THE FIRST PLACE HIS LOVE OF FARMING CONTINUED EDWARD GAVE HIM A LARGE FARM RENT FREE
1334-135589-0105_1970-26100-0015 OSWALD SO SOON AS EDWARD CAME DOWN TO ARNWOOD GAVE UP HIS PLACE IN THE NEW FOREST AND LIVED ENTIRELY WITH EDWARD AS HIS STEWARD AND PHOEBE ALSO WENT TO ARNWOOD AND LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE
1355-39947-0003_1334-135589-0016 ONE WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST OFTEN HEARD IN POPULAR CIRCLES RESULTS FROM AN ENTIRE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DESERVES HARDLY ANY DISCUSSION AFTER OUR DETAILED STUDY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IT IS CLAIMED THAT SUGGESTIVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF
1355-39947-0004_3112-9555-0030 HYPNOTIZATION MAY BE SECRETLY MISUSED TO MAKE ANYONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AGAINST HIS WILL A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT OF THE HYPNOTIST'S INTENT OFTEN THIS IS COUPLED WITH TELEPATHIC FANCIES
1355-39947-0006_103-1240-0056 THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A VIEW ARE AS WE KNOW NOW ENTIRELY ABSURD WE KNOW THAT HYPNOTISM IS NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL POWER OF THE HYPNOTIZER THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FLUID IN THE SENSE OF THE OLD MESMERISM
1355-39947-0007_4788-294466-0029 THE IMAGINATION OF THE HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS THE ONLY HYPNOTIZING AGENCY THUS NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR AGAINST HIS WILL THE STORY OF TELEPATHIC MYSTERIES WHICH IS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
1355-39947-0009_7402-90848-0032 WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
1355-39947-0010_4853-27670-0007 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0011_4406-16883-0017 BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
1355-39947-0012_7402-59171-0033 THE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE BAD CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOTH ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE AND IMITATION OF THE EVIL MAY WORK WITH THE SAME MENTAL TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE THAN OTHERS ON THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT
1355-39947-0013_8629-261140-0039 THEIR EXPRESSION AWAKENS CONFIDENCE THEIR VOICE AND THEIR WORDS REACH DEEPER LAYERS OF THE MIND THEIR CALMNESS AND FIRMNESS OVERWHELM MORE EASILY THE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS
1355-39947-0014_4195-186236-0027 BUT THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE LIES AFTER ALL IN THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUGGESTIBILITY AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVE SUCH IMPRESSIONS THE EASILY SUGGESTIBLE PERSON CANNOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY INTERDICT HE MAY CATCH SUGGESTIONS EVERYWHERE
1355-39947-0015_4397-15666-0021 ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ANY DISPLAY IN THE SHOP WINDOW MAY OVERRUN HIS OWN INTENTIONS WHAT HE NEEDS IS TRAINING IN FIRMNESS THE APPLICATION OF REENFORCED SUGGESTION OR EVEN OF HYPNOTISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS EVEN FOR HIM
1355-39947-0018_8098-275181-0009 NO OTHER VIEW OF MENTAL LIFE EXCEPT THE CAUSAL ONE COULD BE IN QUESTION AS SOON AS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COMMUNITY IT BECOMES OUR DUTY TO BRING THE CAUSAL AND THE PURPOSIVE VIEW INTO HARMONY AND IT WOULD BE NARROW AND SHORT SIGHTED SIMPLY TO
1355-39947-0019_8797-294123-0007 DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
1355-39947-0020_6064-56168-0025 THIS OPPOSITION ARGUES AS FOLLOWS HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE BRINGS THE PATIENT UNDER THE WILL CONTROL OF THE HYPNOTIZER AND THUS DESTROYS HIS OWN FREEDOM WHATEVER THE PATIENT MAY REACH IN THE ALTERED STATES IS REACHED WITHOUT HIS OWN EFFORT WHILE HE IS THE PASSIVE RECEIVER
1355-39947-0021_2764-36617-0025 HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS THEREFORE NO MORAL VALUE AND IF HE IS REALLY CURED OF HIS DRUNKENNESS OR OF HIS PERVERSE HABITS OF HIS MISUSE OF COCAINE OR OF HIS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES HE HAS LOST THE RIGHT TO BE COUNTED A MORAL AGENT IT WOULD BE BETTER
1355-39947-0022_5104-33407-0003 IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
1355-39947-0023_5778-12761-0003 NO ONE CAN INSIST TOO EARNESTLY THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING ONLY IF IT SERVES MORAL DUTIES AND MORAL FREEDOM AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PLEASURES AND ABSENCE OF PAIN ONLY THOSE WHO SET FORTH THIS ARGUMENT ARE ENTIRELY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
1355-39947-0027_8226-274371-0035 YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THAT UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE FREE CONTROL AND EXERCISE OF THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND
1355-39947-0029_5339-14133-0035 BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
1355-39947-0032_5339-14133-0038 BUT AFTER A LONG EXPERIENCE I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER A MAN WAS EVER CURED IN SUCH A WAY BY HYPNOTISM OF SERIOUS DISTURBANCES AND OF THOSE ANOMALOUS ACTIONS WHICH THE CRITICS WANT TO SEE OVERCOME BY THE PATIENT'S OWN MORAL EFFORTS ON THE CONTRARY
1355-39947-0034_1363-139304-0007 IF AGAIN AND AGAIN I HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE NEW CASES IT IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE DURING THE TREATMENT TOO MUCH OF THIS DAILY AND HOURLY STRIVING AGAINST OVERPOWERING IMPULSES THE JOY OF REMOVING SOME OBSTACLES FROM THE WAY OF THE PATIENTS
1355-39947-0035_4088-158077-0061 IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
1355-39947-0038_405-130895-0001 WHEN THAT MAN LEFT MY LABORATORY FOR THE LAST TIME TO GO OUT TO WORK AND HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE BELIEVED FROM HIS JOYFUL FACE THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EASY AND PLEASANT TIME IN WHICH HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE SMOOTHLY REMOVED FROM HIM THE DANGEROUS DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0040_39-121914-0034 THAT IS COMING TO ANYONE WHO IS THE USER OF OPIUM OR ANY OF ITS ALKALOIDS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I FOUND GREAT RELIEF AFTER EVERY INJECTION OF MORPHINE BUT SOON I COULD NOT GET THE SAME EASY FEELING AND COULD EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WHAT SLEEP I GOT WAS IN THE DAYTIME
1355-39947-0043_8226-274371-0024 THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
1355-39947-0046_3168-173565-0043 I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
1355-39947-0047_405-130894-0003 THESE REDUCTIONS OF THE DOSE WERE MADE A WEEK APART AND SOMETIMES ONLY TWO DAYS THE WORST TIME OF ALL WAS A CUT FROM FOUR INJECTIONS OF A FOURTH OF A GRAIN EACH TO FOUR OF ONE EIGHTH OF A GRAIN EACH WHICH WAS ABOUT JANUARY TENTH
1355-39947-0048_3723-171115-0006 AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
1355-39947-0052_1743-142913-0027 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0055_2002-139469-0027 TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0057_1723-141149-0028 ETHICAL OBJECTIONS ARE THE FEARS WHICH MOVE ENTIRELY IN THE CAUSAL SPHERE IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A METHOD WHICH HAS SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND THAT IT CAN SECURE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS AND IMPULSES WHICH THE OWN WILL OF THE PATIENT CANNOT PRODUCE
1355-39947-0060_5456-62043-0019 THE POSSIBILITIES OF OVERLOOKING SYMPTOMS WHICH OUGHT TO SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OR OF ADJUSTING THE TREATMENT BADLY TO THE SPECIAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR OF IGNORING THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT BY DRUGS OR OF CREATING UNINTENTIONALLY BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0061_311-124404-0026 INJURIOUS EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS OPEN WHEN MEDICAL AMATEURS UNDERTAKE SUCH WORK CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES AND A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
1355-39947-0062_2836-5355-0019 WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0065_6000-55211-0055 IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
1355-39947-0066_1447-130551-0004 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0070_4397-15678-0002 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1355-39947-0071_226-131533-0009 ANY ABSURD SUPERSTITION CAN BECOME ACCREDITED BECAUSE ITS CURATIVE VALUE MAY BE EQUAL TO A TRULY VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER GREATLY IF THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM BODILY SUFFERING
1355-39947-0073_2391-145015-0022 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0074_2289-152257-0002 WHO DOES NOT NEED THE STRONG RELIGIOUS REENFORCEMENT OF THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE REENFORCES INSTEAD THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE PATIENT BY SLIGHT INFLUENCES ON HIS SENSES
1355-39947-0076_6064-56165-0033 THE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE STRONGLY AWARE THAT TOO MANY FACTORS OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY URGE THE CHURCH TO UNDERTAKE NON RELIGIOUS WORK SOCIAL AID AND CHARITY WORK OUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
1355-39947-0077_211-122425-0081 STILL MORE THAT IS TRUE OF THE HEALING OF THE SICK WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EXPANSION OF CHURCH ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SAPS THE VITAL STRENGTH OF RELIGION ITSELF IS INDEED A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
1355-39947-0078_6272-70168-0007 THE FEAR SUGGESTS ITSELF THAT THE SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENT MAY BECOME HAMPERED THAT IN THE COMPETITION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES OF SOCIAL LIFE THE PARTICULAR CHURCH TASK MAY BE PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT THUS THE CHURCH
1355-39947-0079_2391-145015-0042 IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0080_8226-274369-0023 THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
1355-39947-0081_1963-142776-0008 SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0082_7113-86041-0001 HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0085_332-128985-0052 WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0086_8014-112602-0027 YES THE ARTIFICIAL REENFORCEMENT OF SUCH SPECIAL FEATURES WOULD DEPRIVE EDUCATION OF THAT WHICH IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES BY OWN ENERGY
1355-39947-0087_426-122819-0027 WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
1355-39947-0089_3982-178459-0065 I HAVE STEADILY REFUSED REQUESTS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO USE HYPNOTISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERCOMING MERELY BAD HABITS SUCH AS THE HABIT OF BITING THE NAILS A CHILD WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN STICKING SERIOUSLY TO HIS TASKS MIGHT LEARN NOW THIS
1355-39947-0091_6081-41998-0039 OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
1355-39947-0092_1970-26100-0031 PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0094_426-122822-0032 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1363-135842-0000_3240-131232-0016 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR UNC BILLY AND OLD MISSUS POSSUM

1455-134435-0016_6529-62554-0019 ON THE STREET HE HAD MET THE FARM HAND FROM THE BENTLEY PLACE AND KNEW OF HIS SON'S RETURN TO TOWN WHEN THE BOY DID NOT COME HOME AN ALARM WAS SET UP AND JOHN HARDY WITH SEVERAL MEN OF THE TOWN WENT TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0017_1069-133699-0054 THE REPORT THAT DAVID HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED RAN ABOUT THROUGH THE STREETS OF WINESBURG WHEN HE CAME HOME THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE BUT HIS MOTHER APPEARED AND CLUTCHED HIM EAGERLY IN HER ARMS DAVID THOUGHT SHE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN
1455-134435-0021_2136-5147-0005 BUT SHE MADE HIM HIDE AND BE SILENT UNTIL SHE HAD SENT THEM AWAY HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GAME HIS MOTHER AND THE MEN OF THE TOWN WERE PLAYING WITH HIM AND LAUGHED JOYOUSLY
1455-134435-0022_831-130746-0060 INTO HIS MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT HIS HAVING BEEN LOST AND FRIGHTENED IN THE DARKNESS WAS AN ALTOGETHER UNIMPORTANT MATTER
1455-134435-0023_118-47824-0006 HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE FRIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE A THOUSAND TIMES TO BE SURE OF FINDING AT THE END OF THE LONG BLACK ROAD A THING SO LOVELY AS HIS MOTHER HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
1455-134435-0027_26-496-0007 DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
1455-134435-0029_2007-149877-0007 AND SO YOUNG DAVID WENT TO LIVE IN THE BENTLEY FARMHOUSE WITH JESSE TWO OF THE OLD FARMER'S SISTERS WERE ALIVE AND STILL LIVED IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF JESSE AND RARELY SPOKE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
1455-134435-0030_5561-39621-0035 ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN NOTED FOR HER FLAMING RED HAIR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER WAS A BORN MOTHER AND BECAME THE BOY'S CARETAKER EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BED SHE WENT INTO HIS ROOM AND SAT ON THE FLOOR
1455-134435-0031_4160-14187-0014 WHEN HE BECAME DROWSY SHE BECAME BOLD AND WHISPERED THINGS THAT HE LATER THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE DREAMED HER SOFT LOW VOICE CALLED HIM ENDEARING NAMES
1455-134435-0033_298-126790-0016 BEGAN TO THINK THAT AT LAST HIS PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED ALTHOUGH HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE LOOKED SEVENTY AND WAS WORN OUT WITH MUCH THINKING AND SCHEMING
1455-134435-0035_7302-86815-0029 THERE WERE TWO INFLUENCES AT WORK IN JESSE BENTLEY AND ALL HIS LIFE HIS MIND HAD BEEN A BATTLEGROUND FOR THESE INFLUENCES FIRST THERE WAS THE OLD THING IN HIM HE WANTED TO BE A MAN OF GOD AND A LEADER AMONG MEN OF GOD
1455-134435-0042_1841-150351-0012 AS IT WAS TO THE MEN ABOUT HIM THE GREEDY THING IN HIM WANTED TO MAKE MONEY FASTER THAN IT COULD BE MADE BY TILLING THE LAND MORE THAN ONCE HE WENT INTO WINESBURG TO TALK WITH HIS SON IN LAW JOHN HARDY ABOUT IT YOU ARE A BANKER AND YOU WILL HAVE CHANCES I NEVER HAD
1455-134435-0045_1088-134315-0004 AT ONE TIME IN HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH PARALYSIS AND HIS LEFT SIDE REMAINED SOMEWHAT WEAKENED AS HE TALKED HIS LEFT EYELID TWITCHED LATER
1455-134435-0048_6064-56168-0033 AND HE LOST THE HALF TIMID HESITATING MANNER HE HAD ALWAYS HAD WITH HIS PEOPLE AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AFTER A LONG DAY OF ADVENTURES IN THE STABLES IN THE FIELDS OR DRIVING ABOUT FROM FARM TO FARM WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HE WANTED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
1455-134435-0051_2416-152139-0029 WHEN HE AWOKE AT DAWN THE BARNYARD BACK OF THE HOUSE ALSO AWOKE IN THE HOUSE PEOPLE STIRRED ABOUT ELIZA STOUGHTON THE HALF WITTED GIRL WAS POKED IN THE RIBS BY A FARM HAND AND GIGGLED NOISILY IN SOME DISTANT FIELD A COW BAWLED AND WAS ANSWERED
1455-134435-0054_3168-173565-0009 WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE LONG OLD HOUSE SHUTTING THE DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG HE CAME INTO THE BARNYARD AND LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AMAZED AIR OF EXPECTANCY
1455-134435-0055_1743-142913-0001 HENRY STRADER AN OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN ON THE FARM SINCE JESSE CAME INTO POSSESSION AND WHO BEFORE DAVID'S TIME HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE A JOKE MADE THE SAME JOKE EVERY MORNING IT AMUSED DAVID SO THAT HE LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS
1455-134435-0059_6531-61334-0039 JESSE AND HIS GRANDSON WERE DRIVING IN A DISTANT PART OF THE VALLEY SOME MILES FROM HOME A FOREST CAME DOWN TO THE ROAD AND THROUGH THE FOREST WINE CREEK WRIGGLED ITS WAY OVER STONES TOWARD A DISTANT RIVER
1455-134435-0061_839-130898-0041 AND AGAIN AS ON THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING FOR A SON HE BECAME EXCITED TO THE EDGE OF INSANITY
1455-134435-0062_445-123860-0026 WHEN A RABBIT JUMPED UP AND RAN AWAY THROUGH THE WOODS HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND DANCED WITH DELIGHT
1455-134435-0066_5104-33406-0002 HE CLIMBED OVER A FALLEN LOG AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO AN OPEN PLACE AMONG THE TREES HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY IN A LOUD VOICE A KIND OF TERROR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE TOOK POSSESSION OF DAVID
1455-134435-0069_4788-94904-0014 GRIPPING THE BOY'S SHOULDERS JESSE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE SKY AND SHOUTED THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE TWITCHED AND HIS HAND ON THE BOY'S SHOULDER TWITCHED ALSO MAKE A SIGN TO ME GOD HE CRIED HERE I STAND WITH THE BOY DAVID
1455-134435-0071_8123-275209-0016 THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-138263-0000_458-126305-0009 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
1455-138263-0001_78-368-0002 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0002_1263-139804-0025 SOME TWELVE MILES OTHERS THIRTY MILES BROAD
1455-138263-0004_8095-274346-0031 ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
1455-138263-0005_6818-68772-0034 WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
1455-138263-0006_4195-186236-0000 THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
1455-138263-0007_6272-70191-0034 BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
1455-138263-0009_26-495-0009 INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
1455-138263-0011_2518-154825-0019 THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
1455-138263-0012_5339-14133-0054 A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
1455-138263-0014_2136-5143-0027 THEIR PROJECTILE SATURATED WITH LUMINOUS GLEAMS IN THE DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF SUN AND MOON MUST HAVE APPEARED LIKE AN INCANDESCENT GLOBE
1455-138263-0015_1363-139304-0009 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0016_1098-133695-0032 WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
1455-138263-0019_307-127540-0022 REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0022_2989-138035-0008 AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
1455-138263-0027_6385-220959-0028 THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
1455-138263-0033_7800-283493-0021 THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
1455-138263-0039_40-222-0053 ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
1455-138263-0043_6147-34606-0019 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
1455-138263-0044_445-123860-0018 THOSE SPECULATIONS ARE TOO HIGH SAID HE PROBLEMS UTTERLY INSOLUBLE
1455-138263-0045_6529-62554-0042 LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
1455-138263-0047_8797-294123-0028 AFTER HAVING DOUBTLESS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
1455-138263-0048_7264-92314-0001 AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
1455-138263-0049_3240-131231-0059 AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
1455-138263-0055_3240-131231-0028 WHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED AGAIN HAS THE MOON BEEN INHABITED HE ASKED THE ANSWER WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT DURING THIS DISCUSSION FRUITFUL IN SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS THEORIES
1455-138263-0056_7148-82991-0018 THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
150-126107-0000_4898-28461-0010 BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
150-126107-0001_40-222-0005 WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
150-126107-0002_4297-13009-0039 BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
150-126107-0005_4813-248641-0041 ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
150-126107-0006_6529-62554-0032 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
150-126107-0007_4640-19187-0014 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
150-126107-0010_4051-11218-0021 FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
150-126107-0011_1594-135914-0036 NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
150-126107-0012_6818-68772-0041 AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
150-126107-0014_87-121553-0084 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0015_3374-298025-0016 THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
150-126107-0016_5393-19219-0013 UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
150-126107-0018_3214-167607-0024 I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
150-126107-0019_83-9960-0040 THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
150-126107-0023_1263-138246-0030 HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
150-126107-0031_1963-142393-0033 AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
150-126107-0034_4788-94904-0028 WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
150-126107-0035_4680-16026-0020 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126107-0036_5678-43302-0000 SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
150-126107-0039_1116-137572-0053 AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
150-126107-0040_8108-280359-0011 AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
150-126112-0002_446-123502-0017 WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
150-126112-0004_4014-186176-0000 THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
150-126112-0006_8088-284756-0093 THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
150-126112-0007_125-121124-0083 HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
150-126112-0011_5789-57195-0028 TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
150-126112-0014_5192-19396-0026 AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
150-126112-0015_6437-66173-0036 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0016_3983-5371-0041 FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
150-126112-0018_6019-3185-0020 NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
150-126112-0019_1594-135914-0066 ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
150-126112-0020_8468-286673-0016 AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126112-0023_1992-141719-0011 AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
150-126112-0025_909-131044-0008 HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
150-126112-0027_250-142276-0035 HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
150-126112-0028_1723-141149-0085 AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
150-126112-0029_4481-17499-0047 AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
150-126112-0031_446-123502-0005 BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
150-126112-0032_839-130898-0083 TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
150-126112-0034_7447-91187-0024 AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
150-126112-0036_4214-7146-0055 THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
150-132655-0001_4195-186236-0004 CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
150-132655-0007_3857-182315-0004 I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES

1502-122615-0005_1098-133695-0078 AFTER THIS TERMINATION OF THE SCENE DUNCAN WANDERED AMONG THE LODGES UNQUESTIONED AND UNNOTICED ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HER IN WHOSE BEHALF HE INCURRED THE RISK HE RAN
1502-122615-0007_7178-34645-0001 THOUGH THE RETURN OF DUNCAN WAS LIKELY TO REMIND THEM OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT IT PRODUCED NO VISIBLE SENSATION SO FAR THE TERRIBLE SCENE THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED
1502-122615-0008_8095-274346-0036 PROVED FAVORABLE TO HIS VIEWS AND HE REQUIRED NO OTHER PROMPTER THAN HIS OWN FEELINGS TO CONVINCE HIM OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF PROFITING BY SO UNEXPECTED AN ADVANTAGE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HESITATE
1502-122615-0010_3526-176651-0006 DAVID HAD NOT REAPPEARED NO OTHER RESTRAINT WAS IMPOSED ON THE FORMER THAN THE WATCHFUL LOOKS OF A YOUNG HURON WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT HAND THOUGH AN ARMED WARRIOR LEANED AGAINST THE POST THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE NARROW DOORWAY
1502-122615-0011_6272-70171-0033 IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT THE CAPTIVE SEEMED AT LIBERTY STILL HE WAS EXCLUDED FROM ALL PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCOURSE AND POSSESSED MUCH MORE OF THE AIR OF SOME FINELY MOLDED STATUE THAN A MAN HAVING LIFE AND VOLITION
1502-122615-0012_4014-186179-0041 HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
1502-122615-0020_3982-182255-0023 HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE END OF THE LOW PILE OF BRUSH WHICH SUSTAINED DUNCAN THE LATTER CAST AN IMPATIENT LOOK AT HIS NEIGHBOR AND FELT HIS FLESH CREEP WITH UNCONTROLLABLE HORROR WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH MAGUA
1502-122615-0021_7367-86737-0012 SEVERAL PIPES THAT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED WERE LIGHTED AGAIN

1502-122615-0026_887-123290-0031 LEAVING THE PLACE BENEATH CLEAR OF ITS FUMES
1502-122615-0028_8226-274369-0025 SUFFERED THEIR WILD AND GLARING EYEBALLS TO ROLL IN THE DIRECTION OF A WHITE HEADED SAVAGE
1502-122615-0029_2911-15045-0020 LIKE MOST AROUND HIM FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE HIS LOOK TOO WAS ON THE GROUND BUT TRUSTING HIS EYES AT LENGTH TO STEAL A GLANCE ASIDE HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS BECOMING AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTENTION
1502-122615-0030_7800-283478-0015 THEN HE AROSE AND LIFTED HIS VOICE IN THE GENERAL SILENCE IT WAS A LIE HE SAID I HAD NO SON HE WHO WAS CALLED BY THAT NAME IS FORGOTTEN
1502-122615-0031_8324-286681-0014 THE WICKED CHIPPEWAS CHEATED MY SQUAW

1502-122615-0033_2691-156755-0021 THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE CONTRADICTED HIS FIGURATIVE AND BOASTFUL LANGUAGE
1502-122615-0035_4340-15220-0094 IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN ABODE THE SYMPATHY OF ONE LIKE HIMSELF AGED FORLORN AND CHILDLESS THE INDIANS WHO BELIEVE IN THE HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUES AND DEFECTS IN CHARACTER
1502-122615-0037_8419-286667-0007 BUT WHO HAS EVER FOUND A HURON ASLEEP THE DARKNESS OF THE IMPENDING CLOUD WHICH PRECEDES A BURST OF THUNDER WAS NOT BLACKER THAN THE BROW OF MAGUA AS HE EXCLAIMED THE DELAWARES OF THE LAKES
1502-122615-0038_5163-39921-0023 NOT SO THEY WHO WEAR THE PETTICOATS OF SQUAWS ON THEIR OWN RIVER ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN PASSING THE TRIBE DID MY YOUNG MEN TAKE HIS SCALP
1502-122619-0000_2196-170379-0018 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0001_5390-30096-0022 COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
1502-122619-0002_328-129766-0003 THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
1502-122619-0009_7447-91187-0034 THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
1502-122619-0012_4441-76263-0045 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0013_7800-283478-0009 BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
1502-122619-0014_5390-24512-0022 FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
1502-122619-0015_6476-96661-0006 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0017_7278-104730-0036 ONE WHO SPOKE ALL THOSE LANGUAGES THAT WERE CULTIVATED AMONG THE NORTHERN ABORIGINES THE WISE HURON IS WELCOME SAID THE DELAWARE
1502-122619-0018_1743-142913-0030 COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
1502-122619-0019_3374-298025-0000 HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
1502-122619-0020_7794-295948-0005 THEN THE DELAWARE INVITED HIS GUEST TO ENTER HIS OWN LODGE AND SHARE HIS MORNING MEAL THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED AND THE TWO WARRIORS ATTENDED BY THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLD MEN WALKED CALMLY AWAY
1502-122619-0021_1553-140048-0033 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0023_289-121665-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
1502-122619-0024_8095-274345-0003 IS THE FACE OF MY GREAT CANADA FATHER TURNED AGAIN TOWARD HIS HURON CHILDREN
1502-122619-0027_3436-172171-0028 THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
1502-122619-0031_7505-258964-0042 IT IS WELL JUSTICE IS THE MASTER OF A RED SKIN WHY SHOULD THEY BRIGHTEN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AND SHARPEN THEIR KNIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE NOT THE PALE FACES THICKER THAN THE SWALLOWS IN THE SEASON OF FLOWERS
1502-122619-0033_6437-66173-0031 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0036_8975-270782-0070 IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
1502-122619-0037_4441-76263-0031 AND GRAVELY SPREAD HIS PRESENTS BEFORE THE DAZZLED EYES OF HIS HOSTS THEY CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF TRINKETS OF LITTLE VALUE PLUNDERED FROM THE SLAUGHTERED FEMALES OF WILLIAM HENRY
1502-122619-0038_4088-158077-0029 IN THE DIVISION OF THE BAUBLES THE CUNNING HURON DISCOVERED NO LESS ART THAN IN THEIR SELECTION WHILE HE BESTOWED THOSE OF GREATER VALUE ON THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS HOST HE SEASONED HIS OFFERINGS TO THEIR INFERIORS
1502-122619-0041_5390-30096-0005 MY BROTHER IS A WISE CHIEF HE IS WELCOME THE HURONS LOVE THEIR FRIENDS THE DELAWARES RETURNED MAGUA WHY SHOULD THEY NOT THEY ARE COLORED BY THE SAME SUN AND THEIR JUST MEN WILL HUNT IN THE SAME GROUNDS AFTER DEATH
1502-122619-0042_5163-18515-0032 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0043_200-124139-0027 AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
1502-122619-0044_2518-154826-0019 WOULD THE YENGEESE SEND THEIR WOMEN AS SPIES DID NOT THE HURON CHIEF SAY HE TOOK WOMEN IN THE BATTLE HE TOLD NO LIE THE YENGEESE HAVE SENT OUT THEIR SCOUTS
1502-122619-0046_6925-80680-0059 WOULD HAVE ENTITLED MAGUA TO THE REPUTATION OF A SKILLFUL DIPLOMATIST THE RECENT DEFECTION OF THE TRIBE HAD AS THEY WELL KNEW THEMSELVES SUBJECTED THE DELAWARES TO MUCH REPROACH AMONG THEIR FRENCH ALLIES
1502-122619-0047_7800-283478-0029 AND THEY WERE NOW MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS WERE TO BE REGARDED WITH JEALOUSY AND DISTRUST THERE WAS NO DEEP INSIGHT INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS NECESSARY TO FORESEE
1502-122619-0052_7278-246956-0011 WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
1502-122619-0053_3240-131231-0076 THAT THE PALE FACE WHO HAS SLAIN SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS GOES IN AND OUT AMONG THE DELAWARES GO MY GREAT CANADA FATHER IS NOT A FOOL
1502-122619-0054_5703-47198-0058 LA LONGUE CARABINE THE DELAWARE WARRIORS STARTED AT THE WELL KNOWN NAME BETRAYING BY THEIR AMAZEMENT THAT THEY NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE SO FAMOUS AMONG THE INDIAN ALLIES OF FRANCE WAS WITHIN THEIR POWER
1502-122619-0061_1447-130552-0008 MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
1502-122619-0066_7859-102521-0002 NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
1502-122619-0068_7264-92316-0029 THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
1502-122619-0069_1447-17506-0021 ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
1502-122619-0070_1867-148436-0023 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0078_4406-16882-0030 SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
1502-122619-0079_6078-54007-0039 WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
1502-122619-0081_4018-107338-0020 HE ALSO WORE ARMLETS AND CINCTURES ABOVE THE ANKLES OF THE LATTER PRECIOUS METAL
1502-122619-0082_5339-14133-0024 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0084_6019-3185-0076 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1502-122619-0085_8975-270782-0045 WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
1502-122619-0086_6476-57446-0021 THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
1502-122619-0087_8629-261140-0048 WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
1502-122619-0088_1578-140045-0023 THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
1502-122619-0089_5652-39938-0044 THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
1502-122619-0094_911-130578-0013 THE CHIEFS DREW BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT
1553-140047-0000_3112-9555-0086 SNOW WHITE ROSE RED JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SIMPSONS REACHED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRISIS EVEN IN THEIR FAMILY
1553-140047-0002_1594-135914-0126 THINKING RIGHTLY THAT THE TOWN WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH RATHER THAN THE TOWN OF THEIR ADOPTION SHOULD FEED THEM AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL THE CHILDREN WERE OF AN AGE FOR SELF SUPPORT THERE WAS LITTLE TO EAT IN THE HOUSEHOLD
1553-140047-0003_8465-246943-0017 AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
1553-140047-0004_3374-298026-0008 THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY POPULAR FAVORITES BUT THEY DID RECEIVE CERTAIN UNDESIRABLE MORSELS FROM THE MORE CHARITABLE HOUSEWIVES LIFE WAS RATHER DULL AND DREARY HOWEVER AND IN THE CHILL AND GLOOM OF NOVEMBER WEATHER
1553-140047-0005_1841-179183-0029 WITH THE VISION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURKEYS BURSTING WITH FAT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S GOLDEN PUMPKINS AND SQUASHES AND CORN BEING GARNERED INTO BARNS THE YOUNG SIMPSONS GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME INEXPENSIVE FORM OF EXCITEMENT
1553-140047-0007_5688-15787-0026 WITH LARGE BUSINESS SAGACITY AND AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER THEY NOW PROPOSED TO EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO A LARGER AREA AND DISTRIBUTE SOAP TO CONTIGUOUS VILLAGES
1553-140047-0008_5049-25947-0086 IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
1553-140047-0010_1334-135589-0102 PROMISING HER HELP AND THAT OF EMMA JANE PERKINS THE PREMIUMS WITHIN THEIR POSSIBLE GRASP WERE THREE A BOOKCASE A PLUSH RECLINING CHAIR AND A BANQUET LAMP OF COURSE THE SIMPSONS HAD NO BOOKS

1624-142933-0000_1992-141719-0010 PETER SEES ROSEBREAST AND FINDS REDCOAT
1624-142933-0002_1116-137572-0035 THEN LOOKED DOWN AT PETER AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED I DON'T HEAR ANY STRANGE VOICE SAID SHE THE WAY YOU ARE STARING PETER RABBIT ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAD REALLY HEARD SOMETHING NEW AND WORTH WHILE
1624-142933-0003_27-124992-0068 JUST THEN THERE WERE TWO OR THREE RATHER SHARP SQUEAKY NOTES FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TREES THERE CRIED PETER THERE DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0005_3242-67168-0030 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THOSE SHARP SQUEAKY VOICES THEY RATHER GET ON MY NERVES WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SQUEAK LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS ROSEBREAST CAN IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
1624-142933-0008_2002-139469-0047 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0009_6019-3185-0041 ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
1624-142933-0010_5322-7678-0027 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0013_322-124147-0068 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME

1624-142933-0015_7635-105409-0003 NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT JENNY THAT SONG IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WELCOME ROBIN'S OF COURSE IT IS RETORTED JENNY THAT IS ROSEBREAST SINGING UP THERE AND THERE HE IS RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THAT TREE
1624-142933-0016_1235-135883-0024 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017_1088-129236-0000 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0019_3436-172171-0053 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020_4397-15668-0030 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0021_2911-7601-0018 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0022_6848-76049-0031 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023_5104-33407-0006 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0029_3235-28433-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0030_250-140277-0004 AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
1624-142933-0032_1963-142393-0045 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0034_2989-138035-0016 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0037_5163-39921-0040 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038_2182-150130-0018 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0043_4898-28461-0024 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-168623-0001_412-126975-0057 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0003_1723-141149-0086 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0006_4267-72637-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007_254-145458-0019 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0010_4481-17499-0013 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0015_5463-39174-0035 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0017_5703-47198-0044 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0020_1355-39947-0095 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0023_6476-57446-0076 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024_6563-63821-0013 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025_5339-14133-0034 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0027_60-121082-0075 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028_125-121342-0000 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0031_669-129074-0007 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032_3374-298026-0034 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033_118-121721-0016 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0037_5049-25947-0067 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0039_8838-298546-0015 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040_445-123860-0005 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041_8051-295385-0023 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER

163-121908-0003_5789-57195-0004 ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
163-121908-0004_8095-274345-0028 OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
163-121908-0007_831-130739-0010 HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
163-121908-0009_8747-293952-0075 BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
163-121908-0010_2384-152900-0076 BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
163-121908-0011_32-4137-0035 SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL

163-122947-0000_1867-148436-0039 CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
163-122947-0004_2007-132570-0056 AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
163-122947-0007_831-130739-0050 SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
163-122947-0008_4214-7146-0053 AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
163-122947-0011_8468-286673-0026 AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
163-122947-0012_1963-142393-0031 MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
163-122947-0019_5456-24741-0008 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0020_150-126107-0022 MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
163-122947-0021_909-131045-0021 I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
163-122947-0028_2182-150130-0017 EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
163-122947-0029_8629-261139-0052 THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
163-122947-0030_19-227-0017 THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
163-122947-0037_4859-29340-0011 FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
163-122947-0038_6081-42010-0017 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0040_87-121553-0002 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0041_3857-180923-0022 TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
163-122947-0043_2436-2476-0016 OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
163-122947-0044_3607-29116-0006 HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
163-122947-0045_298-126791-0035 WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
163-122947-0050_2136-5140-0027 HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
163-122947-0052_3983-5371-0000 BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
163-122947-0054_4853-27671-0006 THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0057_4018-107338-0012 A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
163-122947-0058_5750-100289-0076 OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
163-122947-0059_7078-271888-0108 THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
163-122947-0060_1363-139304-0025 WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
163-122947-0061_198-129977-0018 IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
163-122947-0062_6818-76332-0036 LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
163-122947-0065_909-131044-0027 AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
163-122947-0066_7226-86965-0027 AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
163-122947-0068_8419-286667-0019 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0069_3436-172162-0022 THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
163-122947-0070_8051-295385-0032 FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
163-122947-0071_298-126791-0047 WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
163-122947-0072_412-126975-0071 AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
163-122947-0074_6000-86686-0025 CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
163-122947-0075_8609-283227-0043 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0079_5322-7678-0039 IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
163-122947-0081_6078-54013-0079 PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
163-122947-0083_2002-139469-0106 HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
163-122947-0085_4014-186176-0041 LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
163-122947-0087_8063-274112-0009 OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
163-122947-0088_1578-140045-0020 HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
163-122947-0090_5688-41232-0037 BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
163-122947-0091_5163-39921-0016 INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
163-122947-0092_1355-39947-0025 JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
163-122947-0093_458-126290-0011 NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
163-122947-0094_374-180298-0041 HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
163-122947-0095_6147-34607-0014 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
163-122947-0097_2436-2476-0019 OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
1723-141149-0000_3983-5331-0016 PONSONBY SOUND BUILD WIGWAMS AND SETTLE THE FUEGIANS BIFURCATION OF THE BEAGLE CHANNEL GLACIERS RETURN TO THE SHIP SECOND VISIT IN THE SHIP TO THE SETTLEMENT EQUALITY OF CONDITION AMONGST THE NATIVES
1723-141149-0001_4014-186179-0007 HAVING NOW FINISHED WITH PATAGONIA AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS I WILL DESCRIBE OUR FIRST ARRIVAL IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE DOUBLED CAPE SAINT DIEGO AND ENTERED THE FAMOUS STRAIT OF LE MAIRE
1723-141149-0002_6081-42010-0028 WE KEPT CLOSE TO THE FUEGIAN SHORE BUT THE OUTLINE OF THE RUGGED INHOSPITABLE STATENLAND WAS VISIBLE AMIDST THE CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WE ANCHORED IN THE BAY OF GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ENTERING WE WERE SALUTED IN A MANNER BECOMING THE INHABITANTS OF THIS SAVAGE LAND
1723-141149-0004_1867-148436-0015 AND JUST BEFORE DARK WE SAW THEIR FIRE AND AGAIN HEARD THEIR WILD CRY THE HARBOUR CONSISTS OF A FINE PIECE OF WATER HALF SURROUNDED BY LOW ROUNDED MOUNTAINS OF CLAY SLATE WHICH ARE COVERED TO THE WATER'S EDGE BY ONE DENSE GLOOMY FOREST
1723-141149-0005_3699-19402-0001 A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE LANDSCAPE WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW ME HOW WIDELY DIFFERENT IT WAS FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER BEHELD AT NIGHT IT BLEW A GALE OF WIND AND HEAVY SQUALLS FROM THE MOUNTAINS SWEPT PAST US
1723-141149-0006_1743-142914-0033 AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
1723-141149-0010_1098-133695-0087 AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
1723-141149-0011_3240-131232-0033 HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0015_8098-278252-0017 HE SEEMED HIGHLY PLEASED THE LANGUAGE OF THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS SCARCELY DESERVES TO BE CALLED ARTICULATE CAPTAIN COOK HAS COMPARED IT TO A MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT BUT CERTAINLY NO EUROPEAN EVER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH SO MANY HOARSE GUTTURAL AND CLICKING SOUNDS
1723-141149-0018_3723-171631-0031 WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
1723-141149-0021_730-359-0044 LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO EUROPEANS AS THEY APPEARED TO BE YET THEY KNEW AND DREADED OUR FIRE ARMS NOTHING WOULD TEMPT THEM TO TAKE A GUN IN THEIR HANDS THEY BEGGED FOR KNIVES CALLING THEM BY THE SPANISH WORD
1723-141149-0024_1355-39947-0058 AND SOME OF THESE NATIVES AS WELL AS A CHILD WHOM HE BOUGHT FOR A PEARL BUTTON HE TOOK WITH HIM TO ENGLAND DETERMINING TO EDUCATE THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN RELIGION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO SETTLE THESE NATIVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
1723-141149-0026_8095-274348-0001 R MATTHEWS OF WHOM AND OF THE NATIVES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS PUBLISHED A FULL AND EXCELLENT ACCOUNT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM DIED IN ENGLAND OF THE SMALL POX A BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL WERE ORIGINALLY TAKEN AND WE HAD NOW ON BOARD
1723-141149-0030_6181-216552-0042 OF A MAN BEING SEA SICK WAS TOO LUDICROUS AND HE WAS GENERALLY OBLIGED TO TURN ON ONE SIDE TO HIDE A SMILE OR LAUGH
1723-141149-0032_412-126975-0058 AND HE ABUSED ALL THE OTHER TRIBES HE STOUTLY DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO DEVIL IN HIS LAND JEMMY WAS SHORT THICK AND FAT BUT VAIN OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE USED ALWAYS TO WEAR GLOVES
1723-141149-0033_250-142276-0022 HIS HAIR WAS NEATLY CUT AND HE WAS DISTRESSED IF HIS WELL POLISHED SHOES WERE DIRTIED HE WAS FOND OF ADMIRING HIMSELF IN A LOOKING GLASS AND A MERRY FACED LITTLE INDIAN BOY FROM THE RIO NEGRO WHOM WE HAD FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD SOON PERCEIVED THIS AND USED TO MOCK HIM
1723-141149-0037_229-130880-0066 EVERY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN KNOWS HOW SELDOM ONE CAN GET AN ANSWER EVEN TO SO SIMPLE A QUESTION AS WHETHER A THING IS BLACK OR WHITE THE IDEA OF BLACK OR WHITE SEEMS ALTERNATELY TO FILL THEIR MINDS SO IT WAS WITH THESE FUEGIANS
1723-141149-0038_4018-107312-0007 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0039_5463-39173-0041 AND JEMMY WHEN HE HAD ANY LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICER ON WATCH WOULD SAY ME SEE SHIP ME NO TELL IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE CONDUCT OF THE SAVAGES WHEN WE LANDED TOWARDS JEMMY BUTTON
1723-141149-0045_328-129766-0023 THE NEXT DAY I ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE SOME WAY INTO THE COUNTRY TIERRA DEL FUEGO MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A MOUNTAINOUS LAND PARTLY SUBMERGED IN THE SEA SO THAT DEEP INLETS AND BAYS OCCUPY THE PLACE WHERE VALLEYS SHOULD EXIST
1723-141149-0047_3947-13260-0023 AND ARE SUCCEEDED BY A BAND OF PEAT WITH MINUTE ALPINE PLANTS AND THIS AGAIN IS SUCCEEDED BY THE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN KING IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN DESCENDS TO BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND FEET
1723-141149-0049_1088-134315-0058 THE GROUND IS CONCEALED BY A MASS OF SLOWLY PUTREFYING VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH FROM BEING SOAKED WITH WATER YIELDS TO THE FOOT FINDING IT NEARLY HOPELESS TO PUSH MY WAY THROUGH THE WOOD I FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT
1723-141149-0050_6019-3185-0101 AT FIRST FROM THE WATERFALLS AND NUMBER OF DEAD TREES I COULD HARDLY CRAWL ALONG BUT THE BED OF THE STREAM SOON BECAME A LITTLE MORE OPEN FROM THE FLOODS HAVING SWEPT THE SIDES I CONTINUED SLOWLY TO ADVANCE FOR AN HOUR ALONG THE BROKEN AND ROCKY BANKS
1723-141149-0051_1116-132847-0028 AND WAS AMPLY REPAID BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE THE GLOOMY DEPTH OF THE RAVINE WELL ACCORDED WITH THE UNIVERSAL SIGNS OF VIOLENCE ON EVERY SIDE WERE LYING IRREGULAR MASSES OF ROCK AND TORN UP TREES OTHER TREES THOUGH STILL ERECT
1723-141149-0052_1246-124550-0013 WERE DECAYED TO THE HEART AND READY TO FALL THE ENTANGLED MASS OF THE THRIVING AND THE FALLEN REMINDED ME OF THE FORESTS WITHIN THE TROPICS YET THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE FOR IN THESE STILL SOLITUDES DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE SEEMED THE PREDOMINANT SPIRIT
1723-141149-0054_163-122947-0025 FOR THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF FAGUS AND OF THE WINTER'S BARK IS QUITE INCONSIDERABLE THIS BEECH KEEPS ITS LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT ITS FOLIAGE IS OF A PECULIAR BROWNISH GREEN COLOUR WITH A TINGE OF YELLOW AS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE IS THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0055_201-127786-0020 IT HAS A SOMBRE DULL APPEARANCE NOR IS IT OFTEN ENLIVENED BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN
1723-141149-0056_7113-86041-0091 ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH WHICH CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS CALLED AFTER SIR J BANKS IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS DISASTROUS EXCURSION WHICH PROVED FATAL TO TWO MEN OF HIS PARTY AND NEARLY SO TO DOCTOR SOLANDER THE SNOW STORM WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
1723-141149-0059_3436-172162-0040 THEY WERE AS THICK TOGETHER AS BOX IN THE BORDER OF A GARDEN AND WE WERE OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE OVER THE FLAT BUT TREACHEROUS SURFACE
1723-141149-0060_163-122947-0073 A RIDGE CONNECTED THIS HILL WITH ANOTHER DISTANT SOME MILES AND MORE LOFTY SO THAT PATCHES OF SNOW WERE LYING ON IT AS THE DAY WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED I DETERMINED TO WALK THERE AND COLLECT PLANTS ALONG THE ROAD
1723-141149-0062_40-222-0045 AND THE WATERS FLOWED TO THE SEA IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE OBTAINED A WIDE VIEW OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY TO THE NORTH A SWAMPY MOORLAND EXTENDED
1723-141149-0063_6209-34600-0021 WELL BECOMING TIERRA DEL FUEGO THERE WAS A DEGREE OF MYSTERIOUS GRANDEUR IN MOUNTAIN BEHIND MOUNTAIN WITH THE DEEP INTERVENING VALLEYS ALL COVERED BY ONE THICK DUSKY MASS OF FOREST THE ATMOSPHERE LIKEWISE IN THIS CLIMATE
1723-141149-0068_2989-138035-0060 THAT THE CAPTAIN DETERMINED TO RUN INTO WIGWAM COVE THIS IS A SNUG LITTLE HARBOUR NOT FAR FROM CAPE HORN AND HERE AT CHRISTMAS EVE WE ANCHORED IN SMOOTH WATER THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED US OF THE GALE OUTSIDE
1723-141149-0071_6078-54007-0040 MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE EXTREMITY OF THE SUBMERGED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE COVE TAKES ITS NAME OF WIGWAM FROM SOME OF THE FUEGIAN HABITATIONS BUT EVERY BAY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MIGHT BE SO CALLED WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY THE INHABITANTS
1723-141149-0076_2893-139310-0042 YET EVERY DAY SNOW FELL ON THE HILLS AND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WAS RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY SLEET THE THERMOMETER GENERALLY STOOD
1723-141149-0079_6848-252323-0004 ON THE EAST COAST THE NATIVES AS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE GUANACO CLOAKS AND ON THE WEST THEY POSSESS SEAL SKINS AMONGST THESE CENTRAL TRIBES THE MEN GENERALLY HAVE AN OTTER SKIN OR SOME SMALL SCRAP ABOUT AS LARGE AS A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
1723-141149-0082_7859-102519-0020 THEIR VOICES DISCORDANT AND THEIR GESTURES VIOLENT VIEWING SUCH MEN ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE ONE'S SELF BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE FELLOW CREATURES AND INHABITANTS OF THE SAME WORLD IT IS A COMMON SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE WHAT PLEASURE IN LIFE SOME OF THE LOWER ANIMALS CAN ENJOY
1723-141149-0083_328-129766-0025 HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLY THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WITH RESPECT TO THESE BARBARIANS AT NIGHT FIVE OR SIX HUMAN BEINGS NAKED AND SCARCELY PROTECTED FROM THE WIND AND RAIN OF THIS TEMPESTUOUS CLIMATE SLEEP ON THE WET GROUND COILED UP LIKE ANIMALS
1723-141149-0088_211-122425-0068 AS SOON AS THE BLUBBER WAS BROUGHT INTO A WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CUT OFF THIN SLICES AND MUTTERING OVER THEM BROILED THEM FOR A MINUTE
1723-141149-0089_4051-11218-0052 WHO DURING THIS TIME PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE MISTER LOW BELIEVES THAT WHENEVER A WHALE IS CAST ON SHORE THE NATIVES BURY LARGE PIECES OF IT IN THE SAND AS A RESOURCE IN TIME OF FAMINE AND A NATIVE BOY WHOM HE HAD ON BOARD ONCE FOUND A STOCK THUS BURIED
1723-141149-0091_5561-41615-0035 THEY KILL AND DEVOUR THEIR OLD WOMEN BEFORE THEY KILL THEIR DOGS THE BOY BEING ASKED BY MISTER LOW WHY THEY DID THIS ANSWERED DOGGIES CATCH OTTERS OLD WOMEN NO THIS BOY DESCRIBED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE KILLED BY BEING HELD OVER SMOKE AND THUS CHOKED
1723-141149-0092_2182-181183-0002 HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
1723-141149-0093_7302-86814-0000 BUT THAT THEY ARE PURSUED BY THE MEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE AT THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY COULD NEVER ASCERTAIN THAT THE FUEGIANS HAVE ANY DISTINCT BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR DEAD IN CAVES
1723-141149-0098_2514-149482-0093 IN A WILD AND EXCITED MANNER HE ALSO RELATED THAT HIS BROTHER ONE DAY WHILST RETURNING TO PICK UP SOME DEAD BIRDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON THE COAST OBSERVED SOME FEATHERS BLOWN BY THE WIND HIS BROTHER SAID YORK IMITATING HIS MANNER WHAT THAT
1723-141149-0099_3879-173592-0043 AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
1723-141149-0101_8838-298546-0048 HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME MOST MYSTERIOUS FROM WHAT YORK SAID WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE LIKE THE FORM OF A HARE WHERE A SINGLE MAN HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE
1723-141149-0105_1235-135887-0012 THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
1723-141149-0106_5808-48608-0058 WHO SAW A WRETCHED MOTHER PICK UP HER BLEEDING DYING INFANT BOY WHOM HER HUSBAND HAD MERCILESSLY DASHED ON THE STONES FOR DROPPING A BASKET OF SEA EGGS HOW LITTLE CAN THE HIGHER POWERS OF THE MIND BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHAT IS THERE FOR IMAGINATION TO PICTURE
1723-141149-0107_6181-216552-0051 FOR REASON TO COMPARE OR JUDGMENT TO DECIDE UPON TO KNOCK A LIMPET FROM THE ROCK DOES NOT REQUIRE EVEN CUNNING THAT LOWEST POWER OF THE MIND THEIR SKILL IN SOME RESPECTS MAY BE COMPARED TO THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FOR IT IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPERIENCE
1723-141149-0109_5456-62043-0029 OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
1723-141149-0110_8425-246962-0019 AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
1723-141149-0111_3486-166424-0009 THEREFORE WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT THEY ENJOY A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF HAPPINESS OF WHATEVER KIND IT MAY BE TO RENDER LIFE WORTH HAVING
1737-142396-0001_8108-280354-0015 WHILE THERE GREW UP IN ME AS IN THE PARALLEL CASE OF CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS A VAGUE SENSE OF A RULING POWER WILFUL AND FREAKISH AND PRONE TO THE PRACTICE OF VAGARIES JUST CHOOSING SO
1737-142396-0002_5789-57158-0029 BUT ONLY A CERTAIN BLEND OF ENVY OF THEIR GOOD LUCK AND PITY FOR THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF IT INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HOPELESS FEATURES IN THEIR CHARACTER WHEN WE TROUBLED OURSELVES TO WASTE A THOUGHT ON THEM WHICH WASN'T OFTEN
1737-142396-0004_298-126791-0037 YET THEY WENT THERE REGULARLY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOUGH THEY BETRAYED NO GREATER DELIGHT IN THE EXPERIENCE THAN OURSELVES ON THE WHOLE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE OLYMPIANS SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY VOID OF INTERESTS
1737-142396-0006_5750-100289-0046 A PLACE ELF HAUNTED WONDERFUL SIMPLY PRODUCED SO MANY APPLES AND CHERRIES OR IT DIDN'T WHEN THE FAILURES OF NATURE WERE NOT INFREQUENTLY ASCRIBED TO US
1737-142396-0008_7800-283492-0003 THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION IN THE CURATE WHO WOULD RECEIVE UNBLENCHING THE INFORMATION THAT THE MEADOW BEYOND THE ORCHARD WAS A PRAIRIE STUDDED WITH HERDS OF BUFFALO WHICH IT WAS OUR DELIGHT MOCCASINED AND TOMAHAWKED TO RIDE DOWN WITH THOSE WHOOPS THAT ANNOUNCE THE SCENTING OF BLOOD
1737-142396-0009_8123-275209-0015 HE NEITHER LAUGHED NOR SNEERED AS THE OLYMPIANS WOULD HAVE DONE BUT POSSESSED OF A SERIOUS IDIOSYNCRASY HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH LOTS OF VALUABLE SUGGESTION
1737-142396-0012_1040-133433-0073 EMERGING OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND PASSING AWAY AGAIN TO DRAG ON AN AIMLESS EXISTENCE SOMEWHERE OUT OF OUR KEN THEN BRUTE FORCE WAS PITILESSLY APPLIED WE WERE CAPTURED WASHED AND FORCED INTO CLEAN COLLARS
1737-142396-0013_8770-295462-0013 SILENTLY SUBMITTING AS WAS OUR WONT WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN ANGER ANON WITH UNCTUOUS HAIR AND FACES STIFFENED IN A CONVENTIONAL GRIN

1737-142396-0018_7078-271888-0028 THAN THE KINDLY BEASTS WHO SHARED OUR NATURAL EXISTENCE IN THE SUN THE ESTRANGEMENT WAS FORTIFIED BY AN ABIDING SENSE OF INJUSTICE
1737-142396-0019_8465-246947-0019 OR ADMIT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG OR TO ACCEPT SIMILAR CONCESSIONS ON OUR PART FOR INSTANCE WHEN I FLUNG THE CAT OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW THOUGH I DID IT FROM NO ILL FEELING AND IT DIDN'T HURT THE CAT
1737-142396-0021_5163-39921-0019 THERE WAS NO HANDSOME EXPRESSION OF REGRET ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE REAL CULPRIT WHAT HAROLD HAD FELT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE IMPRISONMENT INDEED HE HAD VERY SOON ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW WITH ASSISTANCE FROM HIS ALLIES AND HAD ONLY GONE BACK IN TIME FOR HIS RELEASE AS THE OLYMPIAN HABIT

1743-142913-0005_289-121652-0000 BUT HE WASN'T SAD AS PETER WELL KNEW IT WAS HIS WAY OF EXPRESSING HOW HAPPY HE FELT HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN HIS COUSIN CHEBEC BUT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE NOTCH IN THE END OF HIS TAIL
1743-142913-0008_7226-86965-0042 THAT IS SOMETHING I DON'T OFTEN DO IF YOU PLEASE PETER INQUIRED POLITELY WHY DO FOLKS CALL YOU WOOD PEWEE PEWEE CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0010_7264-92316-0024 COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE REPLIED PEWEE THE OFTENER THE BETTER BACK IN THE OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT OVER ALL HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY AND AS HE RECALLED HOW THEY WERE FOREVER CATCHING ALL SORTS OF FLYING INSECTS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0011_7402-90848-0033 THAT THEY MUST BE VERY USEFUL LITTLE PEOPLE IN HELPING OLD MOTHER NATURE TAKE CARE OF HER TREES AND OTHER GROWING THINGS WHICH INSECTS SO DEARLY LOVE TO DESTROY
1743-142913-0012_1624-168623-0004 BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
1743-142913-0014_1040-133433-0053 JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
1743-142913-0015_403-216-0017 THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
1743-142913-0018_6385-34655-0015 IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
1743-142913-0022_1898-145724-0009 THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
1743-142913-0029_6818-76332-0020 JENNY PAUSED AND JERKED HER TAIL IMPATIENTLY WELL WHAT IS IT NOW SHE DEMANDED HAVE YOU GOT TWO HOMES ASKED PETER GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY
1743-142914-0000_8630-305213-0012 HE WASN'T READY TO GO BACK HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH YET THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR EVERYBODY IN THE OLD ORCHARD WAS TOO BUSY FOR IDLE GOSSIP PETER SCRATCHED A LONG EAR WITH A LONG HIND FOOT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME PLACE TO GO
1743-142914-0001_7067-76047-0008 I'LL JUST RUN OVER AND PAY MY RESPECTS TO GRANDFATHER FROG AND TO REDWING THE BLACKBIRD REDWING WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO ARRIVE AND I'VE NEGLECTED HIM SHAMEFULLY WHEN PETER THINKS OF SOMETHING TO DO HE WASTES NO TIME
1743-142914-0005_426-122821-0007 HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0006_625-132118-0048 HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
1743-142914-0007_322-124146-0002 I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE HIM APOLOGIZED PETER I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO YOU THINK HE WAS REALLY VERY MUCH SCARED
1743-142914-0012_4898-28461-0033 HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0013_8108-280354-0019 HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
1743-142914-0015_4137-11702-0002 THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0016_5463-39174-0020 FOR THE FIRST TIME PETER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY SUCH LITTLE ROUND HOLES ALL ABOUT DID YOU MAKE ALL THOSE LITTLE ROUND HOLES EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142914-0017_1898-145720-0016 AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0022_1578-6379-0006 I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
1743-142914-0026_4088-158077-0064 THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0028_1355-39947-0026 IT WAS TEETER THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER AN OLD FRIEND OF PETER'S PETER GREETED HIM JOYOUSLY
1743-142914-0029_8629-261139-0055 BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0031_2289-152258-0019 MISSUS TEETER STOOD UP AND STEPPED ASIDE THEN PETER SAW RIGHT IN A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE SAND WITH JUST A FEW BITS OF GRASS FOR A LINING FOUR WHITE EGGS WITH BIG DARK BLOTCHES ON THEM
1743-142914-0032_2092-145706-0066 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1841-150351-0000_6476-57446-0059 THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
1841-150351-0001_1743-142912-0006 IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
1841-150351-0002_8629-261139-0060 THE LANGUAGE OF EACH TRIBE DIFFERED SO MUCH FROM THE LANGUAGES OF ADJOINING TRIBES THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER THESE TRIBES WERE ALMOST CONTINUALLY AT WAR
1841-150351-0003_5703-47198-0040 THE INDIANS UPON THE PACIFIC SLOPE WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE INFERIOR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONTINENT ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE TRIBES POSSESSING THE FAIR AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA
1841-150351-0005_2518-154826-0013 AND IN THE OLDER SETTLED DISTRICTS THEY HAVE NOW NEARLY DISAPPEARED IN THE NEWER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST AND ALONG THE COAST TOWARD ALASKA THE INDIANS HAVE NOT YET COME INTO SO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE WHITE MEN
1841-150351-0007_8123-275209-0031 THESE INDIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED DIGGERS BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO LARGELY FOR THEIR LIVING UPON THE ROOTS WHICH THEY DUG IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY THE NATIVES SHOULD HAVE USED CANOES
1841-150351-0008_5514-19192-0009 BUT ACCORDING TO EARLY TRAVELLERS THEY HAD NONE WHEN THEY WISHED TO GO OUT UPON THE WATER THEY BUILT RAFTS OF BUNDLES OF RUSHES OR TULES TIED TOGETHER AT FAVORABLE POINTS ALONG THE SHORE THE INDIANS COLLECTED FOR THEIR FEASTS
1841-150351-0009_1447-130551-0034 AND THESE SPOTS ARE NOW INDICATED BY HEAPS OF SHELLS IN SOME PLACES FORMING MOUNDS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
1841-150351-0010_1553-140048-0025 IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SITES OF THE VILLAGES ARE MARKED BY CHIPS OF OBSIDIAN A VOLCANIC GLASS USED IN MAKING ARROW TIPS AND BY HOLES IN THE FLAT SURFACES OF GRANITIC ROCKS NEAR SOME SPRING OR STREAM
1841-150351-0011_3440-171009-0038 THESE HOLES WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRINDING ACORNS OR NUTS MANY OF THE INDIAN TRIBES DEVELOPED GREAT SKILL IN THE WEAVING OF BASKETS WHICH THEY USED FOR MANY DIFFERENT PURPOSES
1841-150351-0017_1743-142912-0018 BUT THIS ENTHUSIASM QUICKLY DISAPPEARS IF A HEAD WIND COMES UP AND THE PARTY GOES ASHORE TO WAIT FOR THE BREEZE TO TURN IN A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION THESE INDIANS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED LIVE LARGELY UPON FISH
1841-150351-0018_2518-154826-0043 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0019_5678-43303-0000 AND LEAVING IT THERE WHILE THE HEAD IS GROWING
1841-150351-0020_6880-216547-0033 THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE CLOSE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE THICK FOREST AND JUST ABOVE THE REACH OF THE WAVES AT HIGH TIDE THEY ARE VERY SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED
1841-150351-0021_4137-11702-0053 FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
1841-150351-0024_2092-145706-0039 AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
1841-150351-0025_2817-142371-0015 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0026_887-123291-0020 THE TOTEM POLE IS A MOST INTERESTING AFFAIR FIGURE SIXTY SIX REPRESENTS THE POLE AT ALERT BAY EAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST UPON THE NORTH COAST
1841-150351-0030_4362-15663-0040 THE CHINOOK JARGON IS A STRANGE SORT OF MIXED LANGUAGE WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTHWEST ARE FAMILIAR IT IS FORMED OF WORDS FROM THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES
1841-159771-0000_8747-293952-0056 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001_1743-142913-0019 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0002_8088-284756-0016 DON'T DO THAT HE SAID SHARPLY DO YOU WANT TO SCARE THE MICE SIMON SCREECHER CUT HIS WHISTLE OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I FORGOT HE MURMURED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY WHISTLING WOULD DO ANY HARM
1841-159771-0005_6000-86686-0013 I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND SAID SIMON SCREECHER THAT I'D MOVE TO SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IF I KNEW WHERE THERE WAS GOOD MOUSING I'D MOVE TO MORROW WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING SOLOMON OWL STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
1841-159771-0006_4088-158077-0049 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0012_460-172359-0095 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013_6836-61804-0035 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0014_7278-246956-0026 AND VISITED THE FARMYARD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A BITE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EVEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BEGAN TO FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET ENOUGH SEEDS UNDER THE SNOW TO SATISFY HIS HUNGER
1841-159771-0016_5778-54535-0013 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0019_1970-10594-0007 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0020_6272-70191-0008 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0023_1263-138246-0005 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
1841-159771-0024_3947-13262-0002 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025_1183-133256-0019 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0027_3526-176653-0029 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0029_6880-216547-0034 A COLD DIP IN ONE WAY PETER MINK WAS LIKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HE ENJOYED SWIMMING AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ALONG THE STREAMS THAT THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH PLEASANT VALLEY SOMETIMES PETER DAWDLED ON THE BANKS OF SWIFT RIVER
1841-159771-0030_2436-2481-0006 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031_7447-91187-0025 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0032_6019-3185-0087 JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
1841-159771-0033_1455-134435-0072 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0037_1069-133699-0034 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0039_5463-39174-0013 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0041_839-130898-0073 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-179183-0002_2893-139310-0044 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0004_911-128684-0089 I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE LED INTO FIRE OR WATER OR FALL INTO A DEEP PIT IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME PATIENTLY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S A SOUND SO FINE NOTHING LIVES TWIXT IT AND SILENCE
1841-179183-0005_7517-100442-0013 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006_6454-107462-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0007_7635-105409-0005 IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
1841-179183-0008_3830-12530-0042 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009_3982-178459-0036 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0010_3374-298026-0020 OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
1841-179183-0011_6836-61803-0014 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012_6078-54013-0055 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0013_1034-121119-0081 THE VELVET OF THE ROSE IS NOT THAT OF A RIPE PEACH OR OF A BABY'S DIMPLED CHEEK THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK IS TO THE HARDNESS OF WOOD WHAT A MAN'S DEEP BASS IS TO A WOMAN'S VOICE WHEN IT IS LOW
1841-179183-0014_7226-86965-0043 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0017_7226-86964-0003 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0019_2910-131096-0006 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020_7148-82991-0015 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021_78-369-0049 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0022_3440-171009-0036 THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
1841-179183-0025_6476-57446-0028 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0028_4680-16041-0003 THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
1841-179183-0038_5393-19218-0023 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
1867-148436-0002_3607-135982-0023 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN DOWN AFTER TEN MILES OF THAT HARD TRAIL DAWN CAME WHILE THEY WOUND OVER THE CREST OF THE RANGE AND WITH THE SUN IN THEIR FACES THEY TOOK THE DOWNGRADE IT WAS WELL INTO THE MORNING BEFORE NASH REACHED LOGAN
1867-148436-0004_730-359-0016 BARD WHO'S HE LOGAN CONSIDERED THE OTHER WITH A SARDONIC SMILE

1867-148436-0008_4267-287369-0007 ONLY IT TAKES ABOUT THREE DAYS TO GET TO ELDARA MAYBE YOU THINK THAT INTERESTS ME IT DON'T LOGAN OVERLOOKED THIS REJOINDER SAYING IS IT HIS SCALP YOU'RE AFTER YOUR IDEAS ARE LIKE NEST EGGS LOGAN
1867-148436-0009_4830-25898-0013 AN YOU SET OVER EM LIKE A HEN THEY LOOK LIKE EGGS THEY FEEL LIKE EGGS BUT THEY DON'T NEVER HATCH THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOUR IDEAS THEY LOOK ALL RIGHT THEY SOUND ALL RIGHT BUT THEY DON'T MEAN NOTHIN SO LONG
1867-148436-0011_198-129977-0015 HE SOUNDS LIKE A TENDERFOOT BUT HE AIN'T A TENDERFOOT FEELING THAT THIS PARTING SHOT GAVE HIM THE HONOURS OF THE MEETING HE TURNED AWAY WHISTLING WITH SUCH SPIRIT THAT ONE OF HIS DOGS OVERHEARING STOOD STILL AND GAZED AT HIS MASTER
1867-148436-0012_3983-5371-0036 HIS EASTERN COURSE NASH PURSUED FOR A MILE OR MORE

1898-145724-0004_5163-39921-0020 WHICH DESERVES TO BE REWARDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR WIFE MOST CERTAINLY I WOULD REPLIED THE PRINCE SO THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED
1898-145724-0005_2836-5354-0011 WHO HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY A DRAGON IF YOU WISH TO MARRY HER YOU MUST FIRST SET HER FREE AND THIS I WILL HELP YOU TO DO I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BELL IF YOU RING IT ONCE
1898-145724-0008_7226-86965-0008 AND HIS HORSE HAD DIED OF EXHAUSTION WHILE HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM WANT AND MISERY BUT STILL HE HAD COME ON NO TRACE OF HER HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AT LAST ONE DAY HE CAME TO A HUT IN FRONT OF WHICH SAT A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0011_3699-47246-0022 HE ASKED HIM THE SAME QUESTION AND THE OLD MAN ANSWERED NO
1898-145724-0014_248-130697-0024 WOULD LIKE TO ENTER HER SERVICE THIS FLATTERING SPEECH PLEASED THE DRAGONS AND THE ELDEST OF THEM SAID WELL YOU MAY COME WITH ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0015_2136-5143-0033 THEY ENTERED THE CASTLE AND WALKED THROUGH TWELVE SPLENDID HALLS ALL MADE OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE TWELFTH ROOM THEY FOUND THE MOTHER DRAGON SEATED ON A DIAMOND THRONE SHE WAS THE
1898-145724-0020_103-1241-0018 AND TAKING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET HE RANG IT ONCE IN A MOMENT HE HEARD A RUSTLING SOUND IN THE AIR BESIDE HIM AND THE KING OF THE EAGLES SANK AT HIS FEET
1898-145724-0021_4267-72637-0010 THE BIRD SAID YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE WHO IS GALLOPING ABOUT AMONG THE CLOUDS I WILL SUMMON ALL THE EAGLES OF THE AIR TOGETHER AND ORDER THEM TO CATCH THE MARE AND BRING HER TO YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS THE KING OF THE EAGLES FLEW AWAY
1898-145724-0022_4853-29413-0023 TOWARDS EVENING THE PRINCE HEARD A MIGHTY RUSHING SOUND IN THE AIR AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE SAW THOUSANDS OF EAGLES DRIVING THE MARE BEFORE THEM THEY SANK AT HIS FEET ON TO THE GROUND AND GAVE THE MARE OVER TO HIM THEN THE PRINCE RODE HOME TO THE OLD MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0024_2691-156750-0033 SHE GAVE HIM AT THE SAME TIME A CLOAK MADE OF COPPER
1898-145724-0025_5322-7678-0038 HERE TOO WAS THE FLOWER QUEEN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HER DRESS WAS WOVEN OUT OF THE MOST LOVELY FLOWERS IN THE WORLD AND HER COMPLEXION WAS LIKE LILIES AND ROSES AS THE PRINCE WAS DANCING WITH HER HE MANAGED TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
1898-145724-0029_5678-43302-0022 IN A MOMENT THE KING OF THE FISHES APPEARED AND SAID TO HIM I KNOW QUITE WELL WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO AND I WILL SUMMON ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA TOGETHER
1898-145724-0031_7780-274562-0039 THE PRINCE BEGGED FOR A FOAL OF THE MARE WHICH THE MOTHER DRAGON AT ONCE GAVE HIM AND OVER AND ABOVE A CLOAK MADE OF GOLD FOR SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD PRAISED HER BEAUTY SO IN THE EVENING HE APPEARED AT THE BALL IN HIS GOLDEN CLOAK
1898-145724-0032_7505-83618-0023 THE PRINCE AND SHE FLEW LIKE THE WIND TILL THEY REACHED THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DWELLING BUT THE DRAGONS HAD NOTICED THEIR FLIGHT AND WOKE THEIR BROTHER OUT OF HIS YEAR'S SLEEP HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED
19-198-0001_27-123349-0024 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
19-198-0002_6078-54013-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
19-198-0004_7078-271888-0077 CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
19-198-0009_3526-176653-0031 DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
19-198-0011_2391-145015-0032 AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
19-198-0014_5456-24741-0021 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
19-198-0015_426-122822-0017 SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
19-198-0019_5022-29405-0010 HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
19-198-0020_8770-295462-0022 CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
19-198-0022_1594-135914-0080 THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
19-198-0024_7800-283478-0017 SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
19-198-0025_254-127705-0002 MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
19-198-0026_7511-102419-0017 AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
19-198-0029_2136-5140-0023 SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
19-198-0033_3723-171115-0054 THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
19-198-0034_1081-125237-0079 THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
19-198-0036_6818-68772-0039 WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
19-227-0001_8095-274346-0026 HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
19-227-0003_4160-11549-0017 BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
19-227-0004_226-122538-0014 MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
19-227-0007_8975-270782-0068 THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
19-227-0008_8419-286667-0025 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0013_426-122822-0013 SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
19-227-0014_4788-94904-0026 WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
19-227-0016_8051-119902-0005 AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
19-227-0019_118-47824-0076 BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
19-227-0021_322-124147-0009 MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
19-227-0022_2843-152918-0060 AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
19-227-0025_6147-34605-0021 FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
19-227-0027_8108-274318-0044 SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
19-227-0030_2817-142380-0027 THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
19-227-0031_5688-41232-0052 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0033_8629-261140-0000 SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
19-227-0034_5390-30102-0013 COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
19-227-0039_669-129061-0038 AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
19-227-0040_1363-139304-0010 HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
19-227-0048_374-180299-0003 OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
19-227-0050_8630-305212-0030 CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
19-227-0051_5049-25947-0041 HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
19-227-0052_8465-246940-0025 HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
19-227-0055_4788-94904-0005 AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
19-227-0057_6019-3185-0001 FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
19-227-0058_460-172359-0014 BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
19-227-0059_3879-173592-0026 AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
19-227-0061_302-123516-0035 AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
19-227-0062_2910-131096-0085 I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
19-227-0064_83-9960-0012 CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
19-227-0066_5867-48852-0076 THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
19-227-0067_150-126107-0027 HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
19-227-0068_8629-261140-0004 NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
19-227-0069_248-130652-0007 THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0072_5390-30096-0009 THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
1926-143879-0001_3436-172171-0018 OUR ATTENTION IS ENGAGED AGAIN ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE LATE SPRING TIME SHORTLY AFTER HER RETURN TO PALAZZO CRESCENTINI
1926-143879-0002_8770-295462-0000 TO SOCIAL USES AND THERE WAS THAT IN HER EXPRESSION AND ATTITUDE
1926-143879-0007_4898-28461-0017 A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
1926-143879-0008_8838-298545-0018 IF HER THOUGHTS JUST NOW HAD INCLINED THEMSELVES TO RETROSPECT INSTEAD OF FLUTTERING THEIR WINGS NERVOUSLY ABOUT THE PRESENT
1926-143879-0009_2952-407-0017 WITH SEVERAL OF THE IMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED ON SUCH A FIELD WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED
1926-143879-0013_302-123516-0028 AND THE SHADE OF GREAT CHESTNUTS MADE A RESTING PLACE FOR SUCH UPWARD WANDERINGS AS MIGHT BE UNDERTAKEN BY LADIES AND CHILDREN ON WARM AFTERNOONS THEY HAD AFTERWARDS REACHED THE FRENCH CAPITAL WHICH WAS WORSHIPPED
1926-143879-0014_2691-156755-0029 AND WITH COSTLY CEREMONIES BY LILY BUT THOUGHT OF AS NOISILY VACANT BY ISABEL WHO IN THESE DAYS MADE
1926-143879-0015_6818-76332-0016 MISSUS LUDLOW SACRIFICED AS I SAY TO PARIS YET HAD DOUBTS AND WONDERMENTS NOT ALLAYED AT THAT ALTAR AND AFTER HER HUSBAND HAD JOINED HER FOUND FURTHER CHAGRIN IN HIS FAILURE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO THESE SPECULATIONS
1926-143879-0016_7505-83618-0016 MISSUS LUDLOW'S MENTAL MOTIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS
1926-143879-0018_89-218-0031 ON THE WHOLE AS I HAVE SAID SHE HAD FALLEN FROM HIGH COMMUNION WITH THE PROBABILITIES
1926-143879-0019_211-122425-0032 ISABEL HAD DEVELOPED LESS HOWEVER THAN LILY HAD THOUGHT LIKELY DEVELOPMENT TO LILY'S UNDERSTANDING BEING SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH MORNING CALLS AND EVENING PARTIES INTELLECTUALLY DOUBTLESS SHE HAD MADE IMMENSE STRIDES
1926-143879-0020_6531-61334-0045 THE TROPHIES LILY'S CONCEPTION OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED OF ISABEL TO GIVE IT FORM AND BODY
1926-143879-0021_1069-133699-0028 WE KNOW OURSELVES THAT ISABEL HAD MADE CONQUESTS WHETHER INFERIOR OR NOT TO THOSE SHE MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED IN HER NATIVE LAND
1926-143879-0022_3983-5371-0025 THAN THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO SPEAK IT WAS MORE ROMANTIC TO SAY NOTHING AND DRINKING DEEP IN SECRET OF ROMANCE SHE WAS AS LITTLE DISPOSED TO ASK POOR LILY'S ADVICE AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE THAT RARE VOLUME FOREVER
1926-143879-0023_6476-57446-0041 BUT LILY KNEW NOTHING OF THESE DISCRIMINATIONS AND COULD ONLY PRONOUNCE HER SISTER'S CAREER A STRANGE ANTI CLIMAX AN IMPRESSION CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT ISABEL'S SILENCE ABOUT MISTER OSMOND FOR INSTANCE
1926-143879-0024_7635-105409-0014 WAS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH HE OCCUPIED HER THOUGHTS AS THIS HAPPENED VERY OFTEN IT SOMETIMES APPEARED TO MISSUS LUDLOW THAT SHE HAD LOST HER COURAGE SO UNCANNY A RESULT OF SO EXHILARATING AN INCIDENT AS INHERITING A FORTUNE
1926-143879-0026_1069-133709-0006 THE EARLY DUSK OF A NOVEMBER AFTERNOON HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN THE STREET LAMPS IN THE THICK BROWN AIR LOOKED WEAK AND RED
1926-143879-0028_2384-152900-0063 SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
1926-143879-0031_8238-274553-0005 AND HENRIETTA WAS CHEERED ON HER WAY BY A PROMISE FROM MISTER BANTLING THAT HE WOULD SOON COME OVER
1926-143879-0032_198-209-0014 HAD NOT BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN ROME BEFORE SHE PROPOSED TO MADAME MERLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE PILGRIMAGE TO THE EAST MADAME MERLE REMARKED THAT HER FRIEND WAS RESTLESS
1926-143879-0039_8324-286682-0014 AND THERE WERE SEVERAL IN HER LIST OF WHICH OUR HEROINE HAD NOT EVEN HEARD SHE HAD NOT HEARD OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS VERY PLAIN
1926-143879-0040_2136-5140-0030 ADVANTAGEOUS TO HEAR SHE HAD ONCE OR TWICE HAD A POSITIVE SCARE SINCE IT SO AFFECTED HER TO HAVE TO EXCLAIM OF HER FRIEND
1926-143879-0044_405-130895-0003 DEEP AND MEMORABLE AS THESE EMOTIONS HAD REMAINED SHE CAME BACK BY THE LAST OF MARCH FROM EGYPT AND GREECE AND MADE ANOTHER STAY IN ROME A FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL
1926-143879-0046_229-130880-0031 AND WENT TO PAY A VISIT AT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI MADAME MERLE ON THIS OCCASION REMAINING IN ROME
1926-147979-0001_4160-14187-0006 BUT IN BLACK HAWK THE SCENE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS SPREAD OUT SHRUNKEN AND PINCHED FROZEN DOWN TO THE BARE STALK
1926-147979-0002_6367-65536-0046 THROUGH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY I WENT TO THE RIVER WITH THE HARLINGS ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND WE SKATED UP TO THE BIG ISLAND AND MADE BONFIRES ON THE FROZEN SAND BUT BY MARCH THE ICE WAS ROUGH AND CHOPPY
1926-147979-0005_7190-90542-0044 FOR MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA FOR A WEEK JOHNNIE HAD BEEN HAVING DRINKS WITH THE GUESTS UNTIL HE WAS RATHER ABSENT MINDED IT WAS MISSUS GARDENER WHO RAN THE BUSINESS AND LOOKED AFTER EVERYTHING HER HUSBAND STOOD AT THE DESK AND WELCOMED INCOMING TRAVELERS
1926-147979-0007_5393-19218-0022 SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO HER POSSESSIONS WAS NOT HALF SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT THEM AS HER FRIENDS WERE SHE WAS TALL DARK SEVERE WITH SOMETHING INDIAN LIKE IN THE RIGID IMMOBILITY OF HER FACE HER MANNER WAS COLD AND SHE TALKED LITTLE
1926-147979-0011_2910-131096-0052 A DRUG MAN AND WILLY O'REILLY WHO TRAVELED FOR A JEWELRY HOUSE AND SOLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THE TALK WAS ALL ABOUT GOOD AND BAD HOTELS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND MUSICAL PRODIGIES I LEARNED THAT MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA TO HEAR BOOTH AND BARRETT
1926-147979-0012_460-172357-0019 WHO WERE TO PLAY THERE NEXT WEEK AND THAT MARY ANDERSON WAS HAVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN A WINTER'S TALE IN LONDON THE DOOR FROM THE OFFICE OPENED AND JOHNNIE GARDENER CAME IN DIRECTING BLIND D'ARNAULT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE LED
1926-147979-0013_2182-181183-0027 HIS YELLOW FACE WAS LIFTED IN THE LIGHT WITH A SHOW OF WHITE TEETH ALL GRINNING AND HIS SHRUNKEN PAPERY EYELIDS LAY MOTIONLESS OVER HIS BLIND EYES GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN NO LADIES HERE GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN
1926-147979-0015_1246-124548-0042 HE HAD THE NEGRO HEAD TOO ALMOST NO HEAD AT ALL NOTHING BEHIND THE EARS BUT FOLDS OF NECK UNDER CLOSE CLIPPED WOOL
1926-147979-0016_2136-5147-0040 WHEN HE WAS SITTING OR STANDING STILL HE SWAYED BACK AND FORTH INCESSANTLY LIKE A ROCKING TOY AT THE PIANO HE SWAYED IN TIME TO THE MUSIC AND WHEN HE WAS NOT PLAYING HIS BODY KEPT UP THIS MOTION LIKE AN EMPTY MILL GRINDING ON
1926-147979-0017_426-122821-0004 NOW GENTLEMEN I EXPECT YOU'VE ALL GOT GRAND VOICES SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD OLD PLANTATION SONGS TO NIGHT THE MEN GATHERED ROUND HIM AS HE BEGAN TO PLAY MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME THEY SANG ONE NEGRO MELODY AFTER ANOTHER
1926-147979-0018_1553-140048-0041 WHILE THE MULATTO SAT ROCKING HIMSELF HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS YELLOW FACE LIFTED ITS SHRIVELED EYELIDS NEVER FLUTTERING HE WAS BORN IN THE FAR SOUTH ON THE D'ARNAULT PLANTATION WHERE THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE FACT OF SLAVERY PERSISTED

196-122159-0025_4160-11550-0038 A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
196-122159-0031_163-122947-0001 BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
1963-142393-0000_3607-29116-0044 ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
1963-142393-0002_4267-72637-0012 SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0004_5456-24741-0006 BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
1963-142393-0006_3440-171006-0021 BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
1963-142393-0009_1926-147979-0025 AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
1963-142393-0010_6529-62556-0015 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0012_7190-90542-0065 SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER
1963-142393-0015_83-9960-0043 THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
1963-142393-0019_4267-78186-0014 I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
1963-142393-0023_2092-145706-0078 WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
1963-142393-0026_4481-17498-0017 SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
1963-142393-0027_89-219-0037 IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME

1970-10594-0044_4195-186237-0032 WITH PLEASURE MADAM AND THUS WAS THAT TERRIFYING APATHY BROKEN UP
1970-26100-0001_39-121915-0005 IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
1970-26100-0002_332-128985-0017 AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME AN AWFULLY GOOD REASON FOR HER SUDDEN INTEREST IN FRANK WOODS BEFORE I WOULD FORGIVE HER THESE THOUGHTS HELD MY ATTENTION ALL THE WAY OUT
1970-26100-0004_332-128985-0066 AS WE NEARED THE BRIDGE I NOTICED AGAIN HOW SCANT THE VEGETATION WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD ANY ONE WISHING TO MURDER JIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE HIM COMING

1970-26100-0009_2391-145015-0079 STILL THE FACT THAT THE TREE IS WHERE IT IS MAKES THE THEORY PLAUSIBLE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HOW FAR WE ARE FROM THE ROAD I DON'T THINK IT DOES
1970-26100-0010_1867-148436-0021 THOSE BULLET HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WERE FIRED FROM ABOVE AND BEHIND THE MACHINE THEY SLANTED DOWN BUT NOT SIDEWISE
1970-26100-0011_3214-167606-0018 BUT IF THE MURDERER USED THIS TREE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD HE WOULD HAVE STARTED FIRING BEFORE THE CAR CAME OPPOSITE
1970-26100-0012_2893-139310-0045 I'M SORRY FOR WHEN I SAW THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE'D STRUCK THE RIGHT TRACK THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T MAKE OUT I STATED AND THAT IS THE STRANGE CRY OF MY SISTER IN HER DELIRIUM LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US SHE CALLED OUT

1970-28415-0007_1235-135887-0027 WHO IS THIS THEY ASKED OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM ANSWERED WHY THIS IS JESUS THE PROPHET FROM NAZARETH IN GALILEE
1970-28415-0010_3242-67153-0012 OTHERS WERE SELLING DOVES FOR SACRIFICE THE POOR HAD TO PAY HEAVILY TO WORSHIP GOD IN HIS OWN HOUSE JESUS STRODE DOWN THE ROOM WITH THE WHIP IN HIS HAND AND UPSET THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WAS

1970-28415-0024_8770-295462-0007 THEN CAME A POOR WIDOW WHO PUT TWO SMALL COINS INTO THE BOX JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID I TELL YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ALL THESE RICH PEOPLE ARE GIVING

198-126831-0042_298-126791-0066 I KNOW HE'LL LAUGH AT US AWFUL BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE LAUGHED AT THAN SCARED LIKE THIS UNCLE ROGER DID NOT COME UNTIL NEARLY TEN NEVER WAS THERE A MORE WELCOME SOUND THAN THE RUMBLE OF HIS WHEELS IN THE LANE
198-126831-0044_2911-15045-0008 THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
198-126831-0047_8419-286676-0010 AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
198-126831-0053_32-21634-0014 BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
198-129977-0001_1898-145720-0017 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0003_5789-57158-0006 HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
198-129977-0005_403-128339-0022 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0010_4397-15668-0007 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0011_8063-274112-0036 AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
198-129977-0012_5393-19218-0036 IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
198-129977-0014_201-122255-0008 BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
198-129977-0019_40-121026-0032 HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
198-129977-0021_1088-134315-0002 SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
198-129977-0022_1098-133695-0044 THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
198-129977-0023_8465-246940-0010 BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
198-129977-0025_8838-298545-0023 BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
198-129977-0026_8747-293952-0019 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE

198-129977-0031_3664-178355-0025 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
198-209-0000_6147-34605-0028 MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
198-209-0003_302-123504-0000 TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
198-209-0005_4406-16882-0065 AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
198-209-0008_3440-171009-0076 TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
198-209-0009_6147-34606-0017 FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
198-209-0011_6181-216552-0039 ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
198-209-0012_8629-261140-0042 EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
198-209-0021_1363-139304-0000 BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED

198-209-0027_6415-111615-0015 WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE

1992-141719-0054_3214-167607-0027 AND WAS TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OCCURRENCES WERE GOVERN'D BY A MALIGNANT DESTINY WHICH NEVER FAIL'D TO OPPRESS THE VIRTUOUS AND ALWAYS CROWN'D THE ACTIONS OF SUCH VILLAINS AS THE GREEN KNIGHT WITH UNCOMMON SUCCESS IN ONE OF HIS FRANTICK FITS
1992-141719-0055_2817-142371-0019 HE PUT ON THE GREEN ARMOUR THAT HAD CREATED HIM SUCH A WORLD OF DISGRACE A MERCHANT HAPPENING TO PASS BY HE SOLD IT TO HIM FOR A TRIFLE AND TOOK IN EXCHANGE NOTHING MORE THAN A MANTLE AND A CAP
200-124139-0002_2836-5355-0020 AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
200-124139-0006_2514-149482-0054 SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
200-124139-0008_3830-12530-0030 SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
200-124139-0010_1723-141149-0067 AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
200-124139-0011_8465-246943-0010 YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
200-124139-0012_8629-261140-0014 IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER
200-124139-0015_7148-82991-0031 THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
200-124139-0016_412-126975-0023 AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
200-124139-0017_1624-142933-0026 MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
200-124139-0018_3374-298025-0013 HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
200-124139-0020_8063-274117-0019 IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
200-124139-0023_1743-142913-0028 I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
200-124139-0025_3214-167606-0013 WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
200-124139-0029_6272-70171-0029 NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
200-124139-0033_2196-174172-0036 WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS OF THEIR INATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AS ALL CONVERSATION WAS THEREBY AT AN END ELIZABETH SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER
200-124139-0034_6147-34606-0023 A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
200-124139-0036_3374-298025-0007 ELIZABETH JOINED THEM AGAIN ONLY TO SAY THAT HER SISTER WAS WORSE AND THAT SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER BINGLEY URGED MISTER JONES BEING SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
200-124139-0038_3235-28433-0000 IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
200-124140-0000_2989-138028-0013 AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
200-124140-0002_5808-48608-0015 SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN THEREFORE TO HER DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL OF BEING CARRIED HOME NEITHER DID THE APOTHECARY WHO ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME THINK IT AT ALL ADVISABLE AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE WITH JANE
200-124140-0003_6476-57446-0063 ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
200-124140-0005_5514-19192-0018 REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
200-124140-0007_254-27760-0029 AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
200-124140-0008_625-132118-0040 OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
200-124140-0009_248-130644-0026 IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
200-124140-0010_5652-39938-0035 I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
200-124140-0014_2182-181173-0026 TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
200-124140-0018_8419-286676-0013 NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR ELIZABETH COULD ENABLE BINGLEY TO KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE HIS SISTER WAS LESS DELICATE AND DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS MISTER DARCY WITH A VERY EXPRESSIVE SMILE
200-124140-0026_2159-179154-0022 THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
200-124140-0027_426-122821-0018 OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
200-124140-0031_8108-274318-0028 LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS

2002-139469-0092_4137-11702-0048 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093_5463-39174-0048 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE

2002-139469-0099_298-126790-0030 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0100_233-134440-0000 YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
2002-139469-0102_839-130898-0014 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED

2002-139469-0104_4014-186183-0013 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105_5163-18515-0018 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS

2007-132570-0050_8051-118101-0004 I COULD MAKE YOU TREMBLE AT THE BARE RECITAL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN WHICH SEEMED TO RISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CHAMBER THEY WERE IN AND AS HE THREW A GLANCE ROUND IT IMPATIENCE AND RAGE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
2007-132570-0051_2952-410-0034 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052_7078-271888-0045 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0054_8580-287363-0018 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055_226-131532-0018 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-149877-0000_6925-80680-0013 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001_7635-105661-0010 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002_403-216-0021 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003_6563-285357-0010 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0010_2196-170151-0028 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0016_7264-92310-0002 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017_1334-135589-0078 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0020_8629-261139-0072 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021_3259-158083-0119 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022_2514-149482-0084 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0025_6415-111615-0020 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0029_298-126790-0044 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030_8095-274345-0018 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0039_8609-283227-0062 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040_5514-19193-0022 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041_322-124147-0029 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042_909-131041-0012 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043_6818-68772-0005 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044_2182-150130-0032 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0047_2092-145706-0058 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0053_4853-29413-0003 DROUET FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES MUCH INTERESTED DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A MAN WHO SEES SPIRITS DOES HE SAID DROUET OH I

201-122255-0003_458-126294-0003 LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
201-122255-0006_6437-66173-0046 BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
201-122255-0007_150-126107-0003 AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
201-122255-0011_911-128684-0068 ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
201-122255-0014_3830-12529-0005 THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
201-122255-0015_7635-105409-0068 HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER

201-122255-0025_8051-295385-0009 SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
201-122255-0026_8468-294887-0005 AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES

201-122255-0036_6454-107462-0023 SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
201-122255-0037_32-21625-0017 I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
201-122255-0038_7190-90542-0017 HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE

201-122255-0042_103-1241-0043 NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
201-122255-0044_5192-19396-0011 THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
201-127786-0001_6181-216552-0008 BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
201-127786-0002_6563-285357-0033 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003_6385-34669-0000 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0005_4297-13009-0009 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0009_7505-258958-0011 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0010_3374-298025-0020 HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
201-127786-0012_5463-39174-0040 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0014_5192-19397-0069 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0018_5789-57195-0029 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0019_4088-158079-0018 AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
201-127786-0021_374-180299-0035 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0024_39-121916-0013 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0025_8747-293952-0077 AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
201-127786-0026_7780-274562-0045 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0028_6848-252323-0021 FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
201-127786-0030_587-54108-0014 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0031_7800-283478-0032 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0033_7635-105661-0006 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0034_3486-166446-0042 AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
201-127786-0035_39-121914-0031 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0039_1502-122619-0055 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0043_5652-39938-0037 AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
201-127786-0046_5339-14134-0003 I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
201-127786-0048_3879-174923-0007 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0050_1737-146161-0000 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0054_2691-156745-0042 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0058_248-130697-0030 AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
201-127786-0059_1502-122619-0071 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060_8226-274369-0002 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0063_3983-5331-0025 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0065_4853-27671-0003 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0069_445-123860-0021 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0070_3436-172162-0031 IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
201-127786-0071_5463-39173-0012 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0073_6181-216552-0081 REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
201-127786-0074_4340-15220-0010 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0076_460-172359-0002 AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
201-127786-0077_248-130652-0026 BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
201-127786-0078_6848-76049-0001 HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
201-127786-0080_405-130895-0020 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
201-127786-0081_4898-28461-0022 BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
2092-145706-0002_730-359-0025 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003_4214-7146-0032 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0007_8324-286683-0028 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0011_254-127705-0030 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012_6818-76332-0029 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013_2843-152918-0063 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014_5049-25947-0087 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0018_298-126791-0001 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0021_8630-305213-0010 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0023_5104-33407-0016 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0025_1116-132847-0038 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0028_7447-91187-0064 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0030_1355-39947-0083 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0035_1898-145715-0048 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036_2289-152257-0007 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0040_1867-148436-0017 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0042_229-130880-0059 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043_3723-171631-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0048_125-121124-0041 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0051_163-122947-0056 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052_6064-56165-0023 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053_911-130578-0012 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054_1081-125237-0075 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055_198-126831-0016 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0059_481-123720-0053 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0062_8063-274115-0018 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0064_3723-171631-0047 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065_250-142276-0019 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0068_332-128985-0080 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0071_60-121082-0007 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0073_1088-134318-0015 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0077_6880-216547-0003 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0081_403-128339-0026 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082_8419-286667-0027 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145709-0000_8838-298546-0052 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0002_6078-54013-0016 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003_8312-279791-0025 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0005_5456-62014-0006 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0007_200-126784-0037 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008_8098-278252-0038 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0010_4441-76263-0004 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011_7226-86965-0037 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0013_4397-15668-0003 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0016_163-122947-0026 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0020_6367-74004-0008 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021_2007-149877-0055 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
211-122425-0000_839-130898-0043 DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0001_1624-168623-0016 AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
211-122425-0002_2416-152137-0031 I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
211-122425-0003_89-218-0040 WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
211-122425-0010_8797-294123-0080 HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
211-122425-0011_39-121916-0012 WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
211-122425-0012_831-130746-0042 BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
211-122425-0015_5678-43302-0033 BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
211-122425-0018_4160-14187-0008 ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
211-122425-0019_5322-7679-0010 HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
211-122425-0020_6818-76332-0049 PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
211-122425-0023_4195-186238-0014 BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
211-122425-0028_26-495-0001 HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
211-122425-0030_1455-134435-0070 D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
211-122425-0031_7264-92316-0045 AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
211-122425-0035_7178-34645-0018 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0039_7517-100429-0017 LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
211-122425-0040_5750-35690-0007 THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
211-122425-0042_3486-166424-0003 NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
211-122425-0043_3440-171009-0044 BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
211-122425-0048_1447-17506-0006 AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0050_1743-142912-0012 TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
211-122425-0052_458-126290-0019 WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0053_1926-143879-0042 THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
211-122425-0054_6848-252323-0012 EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
211-122425-0056_1447-130551-0027 THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
211-122425-0061_405-130895-0015 REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
211-122425-0071_7312-92432-0007 NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
211-122425-0074_458-126305-0020 PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
211-122425-0075_4859-26870-0012 LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
211-122425-0076_27-123349-0052 THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
211-122425-0077_4160-11549-0021 PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
211-122442-0001_2416-152137-0023 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK

211-122442-0008_3830-12535-0032 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM

2136-5140-0002_78-369-0003 HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
2136-5140-0003_7859-102519-0003 TO ME FUNEREAL BUT GLORIOUS WOODS WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE MY THOUGHTS RECURRED TO MY FATHER'S MYSTERIOUS INTIMATIONS AND THE IMAGE OF THE APPROACHING VISITOR AND THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY SADDENED ME
2136-5140-0005_1069-133699-0004 THERE CAME TO KNOWL WHERE SHE DIED A THIN LITTLE MAN WITH LARGE BLACK EYES AND A VERY GRAVE DARK FACE HE WAS SHUT UP A GOOD DEAL WITH MY DEAR FATHER WHO WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION AND MISSUS RUSK USED TO SAY

2136-5140-0015_6476-57446-0040 WOULD RELATE SOME LITTLE STORY REFLECTING EVEN TO MY CHILDISH MIND A STRANGE SUSPICION OF A SPIRITUAL MEANING
2136-5140-0019_2989-138035-0052 AND SO WENT ON WEEPING AND CALLING WILDLY ON THE DEAF AND THE SILENT THERE WAS A STONE BENCH SOME TEN STEPS AWAY FROM THE TOMB SIT DOWN BESIDE ME MY CHILD SAID THE GRAVE MAN WITH THE BLACK EYES VERY KINDLY AND GENTLY

2159-179154-0004_6181-216552-0061 YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
2159-179154-0006_6880-216547-0047 AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
2159-179154-0009_8747-293952-0048 THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
2159-179154-0010_2952-410-0011 ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
2159-179154-0012_4813-248641-0023 THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
2159-179154-0016_7226-86964-0019 THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
2159-179154-0023_5703-47212-0050 THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
2159-179154-0024_1578-6379-0036 AT THE SAME TIME INTO THE AUDIENCE THE ONE WHO WAS IMPERSONATING A NEWSBOY WENT ABOUT CRYING HIS EDITION IN A LOUD VOICE WHILE THE HUNTER CRAWLED ALONG STEALTHILY AND CAREFULLY
2159-179154-0027_8797-294123-0088 THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
2159-179154-0028_1553-140048-0007 THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
2159-179154-0029_6078-54013-0015 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0032_3664-178366-0009 THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
2159-179154-0033_3947-13262-0024 DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
2159-179154-0034_8312-279790-0023 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179154-0038_6209-34599-0034 THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
2159-179156-0000_5561-41615-0046 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0001_2989-138035-0000 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0003_7078-271888-0051 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
2159-179156-0004_298-126791-0046 BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
2159-179156-0005_6081-41998-0032 WHICH HE SUPPOSED CAME FROM THE HAND OF THE OPERATOR AFTERWARD HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SENSATION WAS PURELY IMAGINARY ON HIS PART THEN HE SAYS A SENSATION AKIN TO FEAR CAME OVER ME
2159-179156-0007_445-123860-0007 HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
2159-179156-0008_4853-29413-0027 YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
2159-179156-0010_2989-138028-0031 THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
2159-179156-0011_1447-17506-0007 THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
2159-179156-0017_27-124992-0037 IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
2159-179156-0021_7447-91187-0006 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022_8465-246943-0024 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0023_2989-138028-0068 THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
2159-179156-0027_1455-134435-0007 THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
2159-179156-0029_3526-176651-0004 AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
2159-179156-0030_5561-41616-0021 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0031_1447-130551-0025 APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
2159-179156-0033_2989-138028-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179156-0034_8465-246942-0018 AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
2159-179157-0000_1034-121119-0074 AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
2159-179157-0001_1363-139304-0021 THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
2159-179157-0002_4340-15220-0069 THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
2159-179157-0003_7302-86815-0004 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0006_1263-141777-0002 PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
2159-179157-0007_211-122425-0066 AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
2159-179157-0008_2691-156750-0023 MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
2159-179157-0010_7278-246956-0031 HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
2159-179157-0011_1088-134318-0001 LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
2159-179157-0014_1034-121119-0069 I FELT IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THERE WERE BEINGS ALL ABOUT ME BUT COULD NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES I FELT AS THOUGH EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY WAS FIXED AND RIGID
2159-179157-0015_7800-283478-0016 THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2159-179157-0017_6818-68772-0038 HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS BEAR A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO DE QUINCEY'S DREAMS SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ENGLISH MAIL COACH DE PROFUNDIS AND THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER
2159-179157-0018_403-128339-0007 ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
2159-179157-0020_3807-4955-0020 FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
2159-179157-0021_7078-271888-0080 BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
2159-179157-0023_87-121553-0086 ARE NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF HYPNOTIZATION BY THE PRIESTS SOME OF THE STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES DURING THE CRUSADES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED EITHER ON THE THEORY OF HYPNOTIZATION OR OF CONTAGION
2159-179157-0025_4441-76262-0016 TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
2159-179157-0027_1594-135914-0017 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2159-179157-0028_2893-139310-0049 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2159-179157-0030_307-127540-0023 FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
2159-179157-0032_4481-17499-0010 AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
2182-150130-0000_3830-12535-0012 THE SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND THE BLEAK FALL CAME MYLES HAD LONG SINCE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AS ONE SET APART FROM THE OTHERS OF HIS KIND AND HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE EVIDENT FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER TO SERVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD IN WAITING UPON THE EARL
2182-150130-0001_1926-147979-0000 THE OTHER LADS WERE SOMETIMES OCCUPIED BY THEIR HOUSEHOLD DUTIES WHEN SPORTS WERE AFOOT IN WHICH THEY WOULD LIKED TO HAVE TAKEN PART MYLES WAS ALWAYS FREE TO ENTER INTO ANY MATTER OF THE KIND AFTER HIS DAILY EXERCISE HAD BEEN PERFORMED AT THE PELS THE BUTTS OR THE TILTING COURT
2182-150130-0004_5393-19218-0053 BUT BESIDES THEM WAS LORD GEORGE BEAUMONT HIS EARL'S BROTHER AND HIM MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BETTER THAN ANY OF THE CHIEF PEOPLE OF THE CASTLE EXCEPTING SIR JAMES LEE FOR SINCE MYLES'S GREAT BATTLE IN THE ARMORY LORD GEORGE
2182-150130-0006_2092-145706-0075 AND SOME OF THEM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF LORD GEORGE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR FRIENDLY NOTICE GIVING HIM A NOD OR A WORD IN PASSING EVERY SEASON HAS ITS PLEASURES FOR BOYS AND THE CONSTANT CHANGE THAT THEY BRING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DELIGHTS OF BOYHOOD'S DAYS
2182-150130-0007_2436-2476-0031 ALL OF US AS WE GROW OLDER HAVE IN OUR MEMORY PICTURES OF BY GONE TIMES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MORE THAN USUALLY VIVID THE COLORS OF SOME NOT BLURRING BY TIME AS OTHERS DO
2182-150130-0013_6437-66173-0004 AROUND WHICH THE FOLKS GATHERED SHELTERING THEIR FACES AS BEST THEY COULD FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT AND CLOAKING THEIR SHOULDERS FROM THE BITING COLD FOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE GIANT SHADOWS SWAYED AND BOWED AND DANCED HUGE AND BLACK AGAINST THE HIGH WALLS
2182-150130-0015_1116-137572-0007 YET BLEAK AND DREARY AS WAS THE WINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND COLD AND BITING AS WAS THE FROST IN THE CHEERLESS WINDY HALLS AND CORRIDORS OF THE CASTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS JOYS TO THE YOUNG LADS FOR THEN AS NOW BOYS COULD FIND PLEASURE EVEN IN SLUSHY WEATHER
2182-150130-0016_1898-145715-0019 WHEN THE SODDEN SNOW IS FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO MAKE SNOWBALLS OF THRICE THAT BITTER WINTER THE MOAT WAS FROZEN OVER AND THE LADS MAKING THEMSELVES SKATES OF MARROW BONES WHICH THEY BOUGHT FROM THE HALL COOK AT A GROAT A PAIR WENT SKIMMING OVER THE SMOOTH SURFACE
2182-150130-0020_7178-34644-0029 FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
2182-150130-0022_8770-295463-0022 WHEN THE BUDS SWELLED AND THE LEAVES BURST FORTH ONCE MORE AND CROCUSES AND THEN DAFFODILS GLEAMED IN THE GREEN GRASS LIKE SPARKS AND FLAMES OF GOLD WITH THE SPRING CAME THE OUT DOOR SPORTS OF THE SEASON AMONG OTHERS THAT OF BALL
2182-150130-0023_233-155990-0035 FOR BOYS WERE BOYS AND PLAYED AT BALL EVEN IN THOSE FARAWAY DAYS A GAME CALLED TRAP BALL EVEN YET IN SOME PARTS OF ENGLAND IT IS PLAYED JUST AS IT WAS IN MYLES FALWORTH'S DAY AND ENJOYED JUST AS MYLES AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED IT
2182-150130-0025_83-9960-0034 MYLES HIMSELF WAS AT THE TRAP BAREHANDED AND BAREARMED THE WIND WAS BLOWING FROM BEHIND HIM AND AIDED PERHAPS BY IT HE HAD ALREADY STRUCK THREE OF FOUR BALLS NEARLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE COURT AN UNUSUAL DISTANCE
2182-150130-0028_4813-248638-0014 THERE BE NO MORE PLAY FOR US UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER BALL THE OUTFIELDERS CAME SLOWLY TROOPING IN UNTIL THEY HAD GATHERED IN A LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND MYLES I COULD NOT HELP IT SAID MYLES IN ANSWER TO THEIR GRUMBLING HOW KNEW I THE BALL WOULD FLY SO FAR
2182-150130-0031_6385-220959-0023 THE POOR FELLOW DROPPED FROM THE WALL INTO THE GARDEN AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIM HE STILL HELD A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HIS HAND WHICH HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN GATHERING FOR HIS SWEETHEART HAD MYLES SEEN HIM CARRIED ON A LITTER TO THE INFIRMARY AS GASCOYNE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS HAD DONE
2182-150130-0037_1841-179183-0033 THE TOP OF THE WALL WAS POINTED LIKE A HOUSE ROOF AND IMMEDIATELY BELOW HIM WAS COVERED BY A THICK GROWTH OF GREEN MOSS AND IT FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE HUNG THERE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD OFFER A VERY SLIPPERY FOOTHOLD FOR ONE DROPPING UPON THE STEEP SLOPES OF THE TOP
2182-150130-0039_1116-132847-0012 FLEW THROUGH HIS BRAIN LIKE A CLOUD OF FLIES AND THEN A LEAFY GREENNESS SEEMED TO STRIKE UP AGAINST HIM A SPLINTERING CRASH SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AS THE LATTICE TOP OF THE ARBOR BROKE UNDER HIM AND WITH ONE FINAL CLUTCH AT THE EMPTY AIR HE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE GROUND BENEATH
2182-181173-0001_39-121916-0021 IN THE WEEK BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR ENGLAND HE DID MANY CURIOUS THINGS THE LAWYER LONG AFTER REMEMBERED THE MORNING THEY WENT DOWN TOWN TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO DICK
2182-181173-0002_7226-86964-0041 AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
2182-181173-0007_6064-56165-0000 THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
2182-181173-0008_3830-12530-0023 MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
2182-181173-0010_5750-35690-0000 AND FOUND HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF THE BUSINESS AND SOME NEW BRUSHES AND A MOST ASTONISHING SIGN AND OUTFIT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN HIS GOOD LUCK ANY MORE EASILY THAN THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE COULD BELIEVE IN HERS
2182-181173-0011_7226-86964-0049 HE WALKED ABOUT LIKE A BOOT BLACK IN A DREAM HE STARED AT HIS YOUNG BENEFACTOR AND FELT AS IF HE MIGHT WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO REALIZE ANYTHING UNTIL CEDRIC PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BEFORE GOING AWAY
2182-181173-0013_40-121026-0043 BUT PERHAPS I SHALL COME BACK AGAIN WHEN I'M AN EARL AND I WISH YOU'D WRITE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS GOOD FRIENDS AND IF YOU WRITE TO ME HERE'S WHERE YOU MUST SEND YOUR LETTER AND HE GAVE HIM A SLIP OF PAPER
2182-181173-0015_1034-121119-0016 THEN HE WINKED HIS EYES AGAIN THEN HE LOOKED AT MISTER HAVISHAM AND TOUCHED HIS CAP THANKY SIR FUR BRINGIN HIM DOWN HERE AN FUR WOT YE'VE DONE HE'S HE'S A QUEER LITTLE FELLER HE ADDED I'VE ALLERS THORT A HEAP OF HIM
2182-181173-0016_1081-125237-0011 HE'S SUCH A GAME LITTLE FELLER AN' AN SUCH A QUEER LITTLE UN AND WHEN THEY TURNED AWAY HE STOOD AND LOOKED AFTER THEM IN A DAZED KIND OF WAY AND THERE WAS STILL A MIST IN HIS EYES AND A LUMP IN HIS THROAT
2182-181173-0017_3486-166446-0037 AS HE WATCHED THE GALLANT LITTLE FIGURE MARCHING GAYLY ALONG BY THE SIDE OF ITS TALL RIGID ESCORT UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE HIS LORDSHIP SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH MISTER HOBBS IN THE STORE
2182-181173-0018_7505-258958-0030 GLOOM HAD SETTLED UPON MISTER HOBBS HE WAS MUCH DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS WHEN HIS YOUNG FRIEND BROUGHT TO HIM IN TRIUMPH THE PARTING GIFT OF A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN MISTER HOBBS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT PROPERLY
2182-181173-0022_6078-54007-0023 I SHOULDN'T FORGET YOU WHOEVER I WAS AMONG ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP I'VE SPENT MY HAPPIEST HOURS WITH YOU AT LEAST SOME OF MY HAPPIEST HOURS I HOPE YOU'LL COME TO SEE ME SOMETIME
2182-181173-0025_1737-148989-0022 CEDRIC WENT TO HER AND SHE BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER HE KNEW SOMETHING MADE THEM BOTH SORRY THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT ONE TENDER LITTLE THOUGHT ROSE TO HIS LIPS
2182-181173-0029_7226-86965-0029 HE LOOKED AT THE PILES OF ROPE AT THE FURLED SAILS AT THE TALL TALL MASTS WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO TOUCH THE HOT BLUE SKY HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS FOR CONVERSING WITH THE SAILORS AND GAINING SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PIRATES
2182-181173-0030_412-126975-0050 IT WAS JUST AT THE VERY LAST WHEN HE WAS STANDING LEANING ON THE RAILING OF THE UPPER DECK AND WATCHING THE FINAL PREPARATIONS ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT AND THE SHOUTS OF THE SAILORS AND WHARFMEN
2182-181173-0031_7148-59157-0040 HE CAME UP TO CEDRIC QUITE BREATHLESS I'VE RUN ALL THE WAY HE SAID I'VE COME DOWN TO SEE YE OFF TRADE'S BEEN PRIME
2182-181173-0034_8098-275181-0024 A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY SAW HIM STRUGGLE THROUGH THE CROWD ON THE LOWER DECK AND RUSH ON SHORE JUST BEFORE THE GANG PLANK WAS DRAWN IN HE STOOD ON THE WHARF AND WAVED HIS CAP CEDRIC HELD THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS HAND
2182-181173-0035_8238-274553-0054 IT WAS OF BRIGHT RED SILK ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE HORSESHOES AND HORSES HEADS THERE WAS A GREAT STRAINING AND CREAKING AND CONFUSION THE PEOPLE ON THE WHARF BEGAN TO SHOUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THE PEOPLE ON THE STEAMER SHOUTED BACK
2182-181173-0036_481-123719-0031 EVERY ONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING DON'T FORGET US WRITE WHEN YOU GET TO LIVERPOOL GOOD BYE GOOD BYE LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY LEANED FORWARD AND WAVED THE RED HANDKERCHIEF
2182-181173-0037_7505-83618-0001 AND HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE HEARTY CHILDISH VOICE CALLING
2182-181183-0000_211-122442-0031 OF COURSE AS SOON AS THE STORY OF LORD FAUNTLEROY AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS THEY WERE DISCUSSED IN THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS THE STORY WAS TOO INTERESTING TO BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
2182-181183-0003_8108-280354-0011 WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO LOOK FOR THE EARL'S HEIR THEN CAME THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES SHE WAS A GYPSY SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS SOMETIMES A BEAUTIFUL SPANIARD
2182-181183-0005_3607-135982-0003 IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LONG TRIAL WHICH WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING EVER CARRIED INTO COURT BEFORE MISTER HOBBS USED TO READ THE PAPERS UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL AND IN THE EVENING HE AND DICK WOULD TALK IT ALL OVER
2182-181183-0007_2196-174172-0020 BUT EACH WRITE A LETTER TO CEDRIC CONTAINING ASSURANCES OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THEY WROTE THOSE LETTERS AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFTER RECEIVING THE NEWS AND AFTER HAVING WRITTEN THEM THEY HANDED THEM OVER TO EACH OTHER TO BE READ
2182-181183-0008_87-121553-0097 THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND
2182-181183-0011_83-9960-0036 AN IF THERE AINT NO BETTER WAY CUM OVER HERE AN GO IN PARDNERS WITH ME
2182-181183-0015_441-128982-0018 AND IF THE WORST HAPPENS AND THEM EARLS IS TOO MANY FOR US THERES A PARTNERSHIP IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS READY FOR YOU WHEN YURE OLD ENOUGH AND A HOME AND A FRIEND IN
2182-181183-0016_2952-410-0059 SILAS HOBBS WELL SAID MISTER HOBBS HE'S PERVIDED FOR BETWEEN US IF HE AINT A EARL SO HE IS SAID DICK I'D HA STOOD BY HIM BLEST IF I DIDN'T LIKE THAT LITTLE FELLER FUST RATE
2182-181183-0017_248-130652-0038 THE VERY NEXT MORNING ONE OF DICK'S CUSTOMERS WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER JUST BEGINNING PRACTICE AS POOR AS A VERY YOUNG LAWYER CAN POSSIBLY BE
2182-181183-0018_2196-174172-0023 BUT A BRIGHT ENERGETIC YOUNG FELLOW WITH SHARP WIT AND A GOOD TEMPER HE HAD A SHABBY OFFICE NEAR DICK'S STAND AND EVERY MORNING DICK BLACKED HIS BOOTS FOR HIM AND QUITE OFTEN THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY WATER TIGHT BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A FRIENDLY WORD OR A JOKE FOR DICK
2182-181183-0019_196-122159-0023 AND DICK WAS STARING AT ONE OF THEM WITH HIS EYES AND MOUTH OPEN AND HIS SHARP FACE ALMOST PALE WITH EXCITEMENT WHAT'S TO PAY DICK SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HAS PARALYZED YOU DICK REALLY DID LOOK AS IF SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED
2182-181183-0020_460-172359-0066 MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
2182-181183-0021_1034-121119-0084 HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
2182-181183-0022_2518-154825-0028 MISTER HOBBS COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS SENSES WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTER AND SAW DICK RUSH IN WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THE BOY WAS OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING SO MUCH OUT OF BREATH IN FACT THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SPEAK
2182-181183-0025_5678-43302-0001 THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT SHE AINT NO RISTOCRAT SHE AINT WITH WITHERING SCORN SHE'S NO LORD'S WIFE
2182-181183-0028_8238-283452-0011 PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SHARP BOY AND EARNING HIS LIVING IN THE STREETS OF A BIG CITY HAD MADE HIM STILL SHARPER HE HAD LEARNED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
2182-181183-0031_4195-186238-0006 THAT'S SO HE REPLIED THIS HERE CALLS FOR LAWYERS AND LEAVING THE STORE IN THE CARE OF A SUBSTITUTE HE STRUGGLED INTO HIS COAT AND MARCHED DOWN TOWN WITH DICK AND THE TWO PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ROMANTIC STORY IN MISTER HARRISON'S OFFICE
2182-181183-0033_78-369-0045 FOR IT ALL CERTAINLY SOUNDED VERY WILD AND QUEER BUT HE CHANCED TO WANT SOMETHING TO DO VERY MUCH AND HE CHANCED TO KNOW DICK AND DICK CHANCED TO SAY HIS SAY IN A VERY SHARP TELLING SORT OF WAY
2182-181183-0034_8051-295385-0021 IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DUBIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHILD THE WOMAN CONTRADICTED HERSELF IN SOME OF HER STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS AGE AND AROUSED SUSPICION THE FIRST PERSONS TO BE WRITTEN TO ARE DICK'S BROTHER AND THE EARL OF DORINCOURT'S FAMILY LAWYER
2196-170151-0000_1594-135914-0120 IT OFTTIMES REQUIRES HEROIC COURAGE TO FACE FRUITLESS EFFORT TO TAKE UP THE BROKEN STRANDS OF A LIFE WORK TO LOOK BRAVELY TOWARD THE FUTURE AND PROCEED UNDAUNTED ON OUR WAY
2196-170151-0001_2764-36617-0010 BUT WHAT TO OUR EYES MAY SEEM HOPELESS FAILURE IS OFTEN BUT THE DAWNING OF A GREATER SUCCESS IT MAY CONTAIN IN ITS DEBRIS THE FOUNDATION MATERIAL OF A MIGHTY PURPOSE OR THE REVELATION OF NEW AND HIGHER POSSIBILITIES
2196-170151-0002_1098-133695-0014 SOME YEARS AGO IT WAS PROPOSED TO SEND LOGS FROM CANADA TO NEW YORK BY A NEW METHOD THE INGENIOUS PLAN OF MISTER JOGGINS WAS TO BIND GREAT LOGS TOGETHER BY CABLES AND IRON GIRDERS
2196-170151-0006_289-121652-0035 THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE THEN CAREFULLY COLLATED SYSTEMATIZED AND TABULATED AND DISCOVERIES WERE MADE AS TO THE COURSE OF OCEAN CURRENTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE THE LOSS OF THE JOGGINS RAFT WAS NOT A REAL FAILURE
2196-170151-0007_6848-252323-0038 FOR IT LED TO ONE OF THE GREAT DISCOVERIES IN MODERN MARINE GEOGRAPHY AND NAVIGATION IN OUR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE WE ARE DISPOSED TO SPEAK IN A PATRONIZING TONE
2196-170151-0008_3242-8112-0030 BUT THEIR FAILURE TO TRANSMUTE THE BASER METALS INTO GOLD RESULTED IN THE BIRTH OF CHEMISTRY THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN WHAT THEY ATTEMPTED BUT THEY BROUGHT INTO VOGUE THE NATURAL PROCESSES OF SUBLIMATION FILTRATION
2196-170151-0010_6272-70191-0020 AND ITS USE IN GUNPOWDER AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISTILLATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS THIS WAS THE SUCCESS OF FAILURE A WONDROUS PROCESS OF NATURE FOR THE HIGHEST GROWTH A MIGHTY LESSON OF COMFORT STRENGTH AND ENCOURAGEMENT
2196-170151-0017_3699-19401-0007 THE ART FAILURE THAT CAST HIM INTO THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY UNIFIED WITH MARVELLOUS INTENSITY ALL THE FINER ELEMENTS OF HIS NATURE THIS RARE SPIRITUAL UNITY
2196-170151-0018_6818-76332-0025 THIS PURGING OF ALL THE DROSS OF TRIVIALITY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF POVERTY TRIAL AND SORROW GAVE ELOQUENCE TO HIS BRUSH AND ENABLED HIM TO PAINT AS NEVER BEFORE AS NO PROSPERITY WOULD HAVE MADE POSSIBLE
2196-170151-0020_3240-131232-0027 THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER
2196-170151-0021_3879-173592-0039 TRUER NOBLER THEN POVERTY HAS BEEN RICHES FAILURE HAS BEEN A SUCCESS IF WEALTH HAS COME TO ME AND HAS MADE ME VAIN ARROGANT CONTEMPTUOUS UNCHARITABLE CYNICAL
2196-170151-0022_458-126294-0009 IT HAS NOT BEEN RICHES IT HAS BEEN DARK TREACHEROUS POVERTY THAT STOLE FROM ME EVEN MYSELF ALL THINGS BECOME FOR US THEN WHAT WE TAKE FROM THEM FAILURE IS ONE OF GOD'S EDUCATORS
2196-170151-0030_3112-9554-0016 HAVE HAD THEIR SOURCE AND THEIR TRICKLING INCREASE INTO VOLUME AMONG THE DARK GLOOMY RECESSES OF OUR FAILURE THERE IS NO HONEST AND TRUE WORK
2196-170151-0032_1081-125237-0024 NO MATTER WHAT STATISTICS OF FAILURE A NEAR SIGHTED AND HALF BLIND WORLD OF CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS MAY LAY AT HIS DOOR HIGH IDEALS NOBLE EFFORTS WILL MAKE SEEMING FAILURES BUT TRIFLES
2196-170151-0034_3723-171631-0001 WHEN THE SAILS FLAP IDLY AGAINST THE UNSTRAINED MASTS
2196-170379-0002_1553-140047-0014 BOTH NAMES LOOM LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF HYPNOSIS MESMER AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THAT HYPNOSIS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF VITAL FLUIDS DRAWN FROM A MAGNET OR LODESTONE
2196-170379-0003_5456-62014-0000 AND WHICH DREW THEIR UNIQUE QUALITIES FROM THE SUN MOON AND STARS CHARCOT
2196-170379-0005_4813-248641-0000 NOTABLY DOCTOR WILLIAM S KROGER A PSYCHIATRICALLY ORIENTED OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST WHO LIMITS HIS PRACTICE TO HYPNOTHERAPY BELIEVE HYPNOSIS IS A CONVICTION PHENOMENON WHICH PRODUCES RESULTS THAT PARALLEL THE PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0006_4137-11702-0042 PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
2196-170379-0009_198-209-0004 CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
2196-170379-0011_6925-80680-0035 THE WORD IS USED BECAUSE HYPNOSIS SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES SLEEP INASMUCH AS THE EYES USUALLY ARE CLOSED THE BODY IN A POSTURE OF COMPLETE RELAXATION ACTUALLY THE MIND IS HYPERACUTE
2196-170379-0013_3168-173564-0029 ALLOWING HIM TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION THIS IS EXCELLENT AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOW SUGGESTION WORKS THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE HYPNOTIC DILEMMA AND THE ANSWER IS FAR FROM SOLVED
2196-170379-0014_7517-100442-0000 HYPNOTISTS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO USE ELECTRICITY EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY IT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KNOW IT HAS BEEN HARNESSED FOR THEIR USE
2196-170379-0015_7078-271888-0041 IF THERE IS ONE THING VIRTUALLY CERTAIN ABOUT HYPNOSIS IT IS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE INHIBITED AND OTHER PARTS EXPANDED BY THE PROCESS
2196-170379-0019_78-369-0019 AND A LIMITATION OF SENSORY CHANNELS SUCH AS TAKES PLACE IN SLEEP HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS OPERATES THROUGH TRANSFERENCE OTHERS AGREE THAT IT IS A TRANSFERENCE PROCESS
2196-170379-0022_307-127540-0034 MILTON V KLINE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY POSTULATES THAT HYPNOSIS IS PRIMARILY RETROGRESSIVE HE HAS WRITTEN THAT THE ORGANISM FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY ON VARIOUS LEVELS OF BEHAVIOR REGRESSION
2196-170379-0023_2436-2481-0032 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF REGRESSION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT USED SO MUCH THESE DAYS TO UNCOVER PAST TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS ACTUALLY REGRESSION BY DUPLICATING THE EXACT EARLIER AGE
2196-170379-0027_7511-102419-0040 MEANING THAT IT CONSTITUTES A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE DREDGED UP TO REPLACE THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AUTOMATICISM OF COURSE IS INHERENTLY PART OF THIS VIEW AND IS PRESUMED TO NEGATE VOLITION ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRUM
2196-170379-0028_2159-179156-0028 WHICH CONTROLS THE CONSCIOUS AND VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IS RENDERED NON OPERATIONAL MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE THAT HYPNOSIS RESULTS FROM FIRST OF ALL A GOOD TRANSFERENCE SECONDLY FROM A CONDITIONED REFLEX
2196-170379-0030_5339-14133-0015 WHICH SUPERSEDE ALL ELSE IN THE HYPNOTIC SITUATION THERE ARE MANY MORE THEORIES I BELIEVE ARE PARTIALLY CORRECT BUT THE ONES NAMED WILL DO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS VOLUME INCIDENTALLY

2289-152253-0002_1963-142776-0001 HE WAS VERY OLD WITH WRINKLED FACE AND LONG GRAY HAIR AND BEARD MANY PERSONS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A FORTUNE TELLER SO PEOPLE OFTEN WENT TO HIM TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO THEM
2289-152253-0005_7517-100442-0016 BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF SPIRIT AND VERY SOON HE REMEMBERED ONLY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM ABOUT HIS BECOMING A GREAT AND FAMOUS CONQUEROR AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR WAR HE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BEST MEN
2289-152253-0006_7794-295955-0010 FROM THE VARIOUS TRIBES OF HIS PEOPLE AND TRAINED THEM INTO A GREAT ARMY OF GOOD SOLDIERS TWO ABOUT THIS TIME ONE OF THE KING'S SHEPHERDS WHILE TAKING CARE OF CATTLE IN THE FIELDS
2289-152253-0007_4297-13009-0056 NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE OXEN THE SHEPHERD FOLLOWED THE STREAK OF BLOOD THROUGH THE GRASS AND AT LAST FOUND THE SHARP POINT OF A SWORD STICKING OUT OF THE EARTH HE DUG OUT THE WEAPON CARRIED IT TO THE PALACE
2289-152253-0008_458-126305-0017 AS LONG AS I FIGHT WITH THE SWORD OF TIEW AS SOON AS HIS ARMY WAS READY HE MARCHED WITH IT INTO COUNTRIES WHICH BELONGED TO ROME HE DEFEATED THE ROMANS IN SEVERAL GREAT BATTLES AND CAPTURED MANY OF THEIR CITIES
2289-152253-0011_5049-25947-0122 AND AT LAST THE EMPEROR HAD TO GIVE HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
2289-152253-0013_587-54108-0010 HE ATTACKED AND DESTROYED TOWNS AND KILLED THE INHABITANTS WITHOUT MERCY THE PEOPLE HAD SUCH DREAD OF HIM THAT HE WAS CALLED THE SCOURGE OF GOD AND THE FEAR OF THE WORLD THREE
2289-152253-0014_1594-135914-0006 ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS MARCHED THROUGH GAUL UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF ORLEANS HERE THE PEOPLE BRAVELY RESISTED THE INVADERS THEY SHUT THEIR GATES AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD
2289-152253-0016_426-122821-0011 WHO LIVED BY ROBBING THEIR NEIGHBORS SO THE TOWNS AND CASTLES IN WHICH THERE WAS
2289-152253-0022_3374-298032-0031 WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED AND NOW HE LED THEM ON TO FIGHT THEY WERE ALL EAGER TO HAVE REVENGE FOR THE DEATH OF THEIR KING SO THEY FOUGHT LIKE LIONS AND SWEPT ACROSS THE PLAIN WITH GREAT FURY THE HUNS WERE SOON BEATEN ON EVERY SIDE
2289-152253-0023_6563-63821-0032 AND ATTILA HIMSELF FLED TO HIS CAMP IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER BEEN DEFEATED THORISMOND THE CONQUEROR WAS LIFTED UPON HIS SHIELD ON THE BATTLE FIELD AND HAILED AS KING OF THE VISIGOTHS
2289-152253-0024_1737-142396-0022 WHEN ATTILA REACHED HIS CAMP HE HAD ALL HIS BAGGAGE AND WAGONS GATHERED IN A GREAT HEAP HE INTENDED TO SET FIRE TO IT AND JUMP INTO THE FLAMES IF THE ROMANS SHOULD COME THERE TO ATTACK HIM
2289-152253-0027_8770-295462-0026 AND THEY HAD NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH TO SEND AGAINST HIM ROME WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN DESTROYED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR POPE LEO
2289-152254-0000_6272-70171-0008 WHEN HE WAS BUT TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HE WAS LAME IN ONE LEG AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE A VERY ORDINARY PERSON LIKE MOST OF THE VANDALS HE WAS A CRUEL AND CUNNING MAN BUT HE HAD GREAT ABILITY IN MANY WAYS
2289-152254-0003_5339-14133-0012 HE ALSO SENT A LETTER TO GENSERIC INVITING HIM TO COME TO AFRICA WITH AN ARMY GENSERIC WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THE INVITATION FROM BONIFACE HE HAD LONG WANTED TO ATTACK ROME AND TAKE FROM HER SOME OF THE RICH COUNTRIES SHE HAD CONQUERED
2289-152254-0006_7302-86815-0018 THEY WERE ALSO DEFEATED IN SEVERAL OTHER BATTLES AT LAST THEY HAD TO FLEE FOR SAFETY TO TWO OR THREE TOWNS WHICH THE VANDALS HAD NOT YET TAKEN ONE OF THESE TOWNS WAS HIPPO GENSERIC CAPTURED THIS TOWN
2289-152254-0017_322-124146-0015 SOME YEARS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY GENSERIC THERE WAS A ROMAN EMPEROR NAMED MA JO'RI AN HE WAS A GOOD RULER AND A BRAVE MAN THE VANDALS STILL CONTINUED TO ATTACK AND PLUNDER CITIES IN ITALY
2289-152254-0018_311-124404-0034 AND OTHER COUNTRIES BELONGING TO ROME AND MAJORIAN RESOLVED TO PUNISH THEM SO HE GOT TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND BUILT A FLEET OF THREE HUNDRED SHIPS TO CARRY HIS TROOPS TO CARTHAGE
2289-152254-0019_3983-5371-0054 BUT HE FIRST MARCHED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ALPS THROUGH GAUL AND DOWN TO THE SEAPORT OF CARTHAGENA IN SPAIN WHERE HIS FLEET WAS STATIONED HE TOOK THIS ROUTE BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO ADD TO HIS FORCES
2289-152254-0021_2007-149877-0038 AND ENTERTAINED HIM HOSPITABLY NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS THE EMPEROR MAJORIAN OF COURSE PEACE WAS NOT MADE THE EMPEROR LEFT CARTHAGE AFTER HAVING GOT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS HE COULD
2289-152254-0022_2182-181183-0030 BUT GENSERIC DID NOT WAIT FOR THE ROMAN FLEET TO COME TO ATTACK HIM IN HIS CAPITAL WHEN HE GOT WORD THAT IT WAS IN THE BAY OF CARTHAGENA HE SAILED THERE WITH A FLEET OF HIS OWN AND IN A SINGLE DAY BURNED OR SANK NEARLY ALL THE ROMAN SHIPS
2289-152254-0023_6272-70171-0039 AFTER THIS THE VANDALS BECAME MORE THAN EVER THE TERROR OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALL THE COUNTRIES BORDERING UPON IT EVERY YEAR THEIR SHIPS WENT ROUND THE COASTS FROM ASIA MINOR TO SPAIN ATTACKING AND PLUNDERING CITIES ON THEIR WAY
2289-152254-0025_4853-27670-0017 TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS THE PIRATES THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SHIPS IN THIS FLEET AND THEY CARRIED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN
2289-152254-0026_3857-182317-0029 THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
2289-152254-0028_4160-11550-0005 IN AMONG THE ROMAN SHIPS TOWING BEHIND THEM LARGE BOATS FILLED WITH MATERIAL THAT WOULD EASILY BURN THESE BOATS WERE SET ON FIRE AND FLOATED AGAINST THE ROMAN VESSELS WHICH ALSO WERE SOON ON FIRE THE FLAMES QUICKLY SPREAD
2289-152257-0000_6064-300880-0006 IN THE TIME OF CLOVIS THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED BULGARIA WAS INHABITED BY GOTHS ONE DAY A POOR SHEPHERD BOY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LEFT HIS MOUNTAIN HOME IN THAT COUNTRY TO GO TO THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH WAS MANY MILES AWAY
2289-152257-0004_307-127535-0020 AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
2289-152257-0006_6848-252323-0040 AND GAVE HIM THE BEST EDUCATION THAT COULD BE HAD IN THE CITY
2289-152257-0009_211-122442-0002 JUSTINIAN REIGNED FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND DID SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED JUSTINIAN THE GREAT HE HAD MANY WARS DURING HIS REIGN BUT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE PART IN THEM
2289-152257-0010_8465-246943-0016 HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
2289-152257-0013_1363-139304-0041 AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
2289-152257-0014_2910-131096-0073 HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0015_7780-274562-0102 AND PREFERRED TO BE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ROMANS ABOUT TEN MILES FROM CARTHAGE HE MET A LARGE ARMY LED BY THE BROTHER OF GELIMER A BATTLE IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE AND THE VANDALS WERE UTTERLY DEFEATED
2289-152257-0016_8095-274346-0049 GELIMER GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BELISARIUS WHO TOOK HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE JUSTINIAN SET APART AN ESTATE FOR HIM TO LIVE UPON AND THE CONQUERED KING PASSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PEACEFUL RETIREMENT
2289-152257-0017_250-142286-0001 AFTER CONQUERING THE VANDALS JUSTINIAN RESOLVED TO CONQUER ITALY WHICH WAS THEN HELD BY THE OSTROGOTHS A LARGE ARMY WAS GOT TOGETHER AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF BELISARIUS AND NARSES WHO IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR ITALY
2289-152257-0020_2436-2481-0036 LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
2289-152257-0021_2843-152918-0009 VITIGES RETIRED TO RAVENNA AND BELISARIUS QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND MADE SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY THAT IT WAS COMPELLED TO SURRENDER THE OSTROGOTH ARMY WAS CAPTURED
2289-152257-0023_6925-80680-0018 THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS MOST CELEBRATED WAS THE IMPROVING AND COLLECTING OF THE LAWS HE MADE MANY EXCELLENT NEW LAWS AND REFORMED MANY OF THE OLD LAWS SO THAT HE BECAME FAMOUS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE WORLD'S LEGISLATORS
2289-152257-0026_4481-17498-0022 JUSTINIAN ALSO DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD BY ESTABLISHING A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURES IN CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS HE WHO FIRST BROUGHT SILK WORMS INTO EUROPE TO THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE JUSTINIAN WAS STRONG AND ACTIVE
2289-152258-0001_5022-29411-0005 AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
2289-152258-0003_1455-134435-0073 AND BROUGHT HIM UP WHEN THE BOY GREW OLD ENOUGH HE TOOK CARE OF HIS UNCLE'S SHEEP AND CAMELS SOMETIMES HE WENT ON JOURNEYS WITH HIS UNCLE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ARABIA TO HELP HIM IN HIS BUSINESS AS A TRADER ON THESE JOURNEYS MOHAMMED USED TO RIDE ON A CAMEL
2289-152258-0004_6078-54007-0001 AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
2289-152258-0008_3879-173592-0022 THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
2289-152258-0010_7402-59171-0014 SHE SAID I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOU AMONG THE TRADERS
2289-152258-0014_3436-172162-0048 AND CHRISTIANITY BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER OF THEM
2289-152258-0021_5163-18515-0003 SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
2289-152258-0022_87-121553-0070 LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
2289-152258-0024_696-93314-0039 AT SUCH TIMES HIS FACE GREW PALE AS DEATH HIS EYES BECAME RED AND STARING HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE AND HIS BODY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY THEN HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS VISION
2289-152258-0027_3112-9555-0075 AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
2289-152258-0028_4297-13009-0061 THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
2289-152258-0030_5652-19215-0018 HE GAINED MANY VICTORIES HE MARCHED AGAINST MECCA WITH AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN AND THE CITY SURRENDERED WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE THE PEOPLE THEN JOINED HIS RELIGION AND DESTROYED THEIR IDOLS
2289-152258-0032_5022-29411-0063 THAT THE BODY STILL LIES IN THE COFFIN IN THE SAME STATE AS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BURIED
2289-152258-0033_4267-287369-0032 THAT THE COFFIN OF MOHAMMED RESTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THIS FABLE WAS INVENTED BY ENEMIES TO BRING RIDICULE ON THE PROPHET AND HIS RELIGION
2289-152258-0034_2391-145015-0003 EVERY MUSSULMAN IS BOUND BY HIS RELIGION TO MAKE A VISIT OR PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE
2289-152258-0035_3436-172162-0014 OF THE MOSQUE AND CHANTING IN A LOUD VOICE SUCH WORDS AS THESE COME TO PRAYER COME TO PRAYER THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD HE GIVETH LIFE AND HE DIETH NOT I PRAISE HIS PERFECTION GOD IS GREAT IN MECCA
2289-152258-0039_3112-9555-0009 BUT WHEN HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MECCA HE MADE THE OLD TEMPLE THE CENTRE OF WORSHIP FOR HIS OWN RELIGION AFTER MOHAMMED DIED A PERSON WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR AS HEAD OF THE MOSLEM CHURCH
229-130880-0003_5463-39173-0058 ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
229-130880-0005_7226-86964-0020 IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
229-130880-0008_6531-61334-0130 WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
229-130880-0012_19-198-0016 ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
229-130880-0014_6531-61334-0010 THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
229-130880-0015_1594-135914-0072 ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
229-130880-0016_7302-86815-0066 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0017_911-128684-0021 THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
229-130880-0018_6081-41998-0007 I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
229-130880-0019_83-11691-0040 I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
229-130880-0022_19-198-0018 IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
229-130880-0023_8580-287364-0039 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0024_60-121082-0006 ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME

229-130880-0035_1263-138246-0004 AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION

233-134440-0008_27-124992-0061 WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
233-134440-0009_4813-248641-0044 WASH WILLIAMS DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEN OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HE SAID LOOKING WITH BLEARY EYES AT THE MEN WHO WALKED ALONG THE STATION PLATFORM
233-134440-0010_4640-19188-0016 PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
233-134440-0011_2384-152900-0078 WASH WILLIAMS WAS A MAN OF COURAGE A THING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM HATE LIFE AND HE HATED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE ABANDON OF A POET FIRST OF ALL HE HATED WOMEN
233-134440-0012_7067-76048-0042 BITCHES HE CALLED THEM HIS FEELING TOWARD MEN WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HE PITIED THEM DOES NOT EVERY MAN LET HIS LIFE BE MANAGED FOR HIM BY SOME BITCH OR ANOTHER HE ASKED
233-134440-0014_2691-156755-0031 AND SMELLED ABOMINABLY BUT NOTHING CAME OF HER COMPLAINT HERE AND THERE A MAN RESPECTED THE OPERATOR INSTINCTIVELY THE MAN FELT IN HIM A GLOWING RESENTMENT OF SOMETHING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RESENT
233-134440-0015_89-219-0030 WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
233-134440-0016_4051-11217-0017 ON THE RAILROAD THAT WENT THROUGH WINESBURG FELT THAT WAY HE HAD PUT WASH INTO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG TO AVOID DISCHARGING HIM AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIM THERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF COMPLAINT FROM THE BANKER'S WIFE
233-134440-0020_1867-154075-0031 HE ONCE TOLD THE STORY TO GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELLING OF THE TALE CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY GEORGE WILLARD WENT ONE EVENING TO WALK WITH BELLE CARPENTER A TRIMMER OF WOMEN'S HATS
233-134440-0021_5652-19215-0026 WHO WORKED IN A MILLINERY SHOP KEPT BY MISSUS KATE MC HUGH THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN
233-134440-0022_6531-61334-0082 IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
233-134440-0023_7367-86737-0098 BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT
233-134440-0025_1867-148436-0019 GEORGE WILLARD AND THE STRANGE SHAPELESS MAN WHO LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S HOTEL HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TALKING THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT THE HIDEOUS LEERING FACE
233-134440-0026_4481-17499-0009 SOMETHING HE SAW LURKING IN THE STARING EYES TOLD HIM THAT THE MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO OTHERS HAD NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM
233-134440-0027_1867-154071-0014 HE WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHEN THE OPERATOR REMAINED SILENT AND SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING HE TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION WERE YOU EVER MARRIED MISTER WILLIAMS HE BEGAN
233-134440-0029_3374-298032-0001 SHE IS A LIVING DEAD THING WALKING IN THE SIGHT OF MEN AND MAKING THE EARTH FOUL BY HER PRESENCE STARING INTO THE BOY'S EYES THE MAN BECAME PURPLE WITH RAGE DON'T HAVE FOOL NOTIONS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0030_625-132112-0019 HE COMMANDED MY WIFE SHE IS DEAD YES SURELY I TELL YOU ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD MY MOTHER YOUR MOTHER
233-134440-0034_8770-295462-0031 THEY WITH THEIR SOFT HANDS AND THEIR BLUE EYES THE SIGHT OF A WOMAN SICKENS ME WHY I DON'T KILL EVERY WOMAN I SEE I DON'T KNOW
233-134440-0036_87-121553-0049 WHEN IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE PURPLE BLOATED FACE AND THE BURNING EYES A CURIOUS FANCY CAME TO HIM WASH WILLIAMS TALKED IN LOW EVEN TONES
233-134440-0037_198-126831-0048 THAT MADE HIS WORDS SEEM THE MORE TERRIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE YOUNG REPORTER FOUND HIMSELF IMAGINING THAT HE SAT ON THE RAILROAD TIES BESIDE A COMELY YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLACK SHINING EYES
233-134440-0038_8465-246947-0013 THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE VOICE OF WASH WILLIAMS THE HIDEOUS TELLING HIS STORY OF HATE THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG SITTING IN THE DARKNESS ON THE RAILROAD TIES HAD BECOME A POET
233-134440-0040_8063-274116-0003 ALREADY YOU MAY BE HAVING DREAMS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0043_5390-30096-0002 AT AN INCREASED SALARY AND SENT TO AN OFFICE AT COLUMBUS OHIO THERE HE SETTLED DOWN WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND BEGAN BUYING A HOUSE ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WAS MADLY IN LOVE
233-134440-0048_4441-76263-0014 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A CATCH IN THE VOICE OF THE MAN TALKING IN THE DARKNESS I LOVED HER HE SAID I DON'T CLAIM NOT TO BE A FOOL I LOVE HER YET THERE IN THE DUSK IN THE SPRING EVENING
233-134440-0052_254-127705-0022 AROSE FROM THE PILE OF RAILROAD TIES AND WALKED ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD TOWN THE OPERATOR FINISHED HIS TALE QUICKLY BREATHLESSLY HER MOTHER SENT FOR ME HE SAID

233-134440-0054_307-127535-0038 I SAT IN THE PARLOR OF THAT HOUSE TWO HOURS HER MOTHER TOOK ME IN THERE AND LEFT ME THEIR HOUSE WAS STYLISH THEY WERE WHAT IS CALLED RESPECTABLE PEOPLE THERE WERE PLUSH CHAIRS AND A COUCH IN THE ROOM
233-134440-0055_8098-275181-0019 I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER I HATED THE MEN I THOUGHT HAD WRONGED HER I WAS SICK OF LIVING ALONE AND WANTED HER BACK THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE RAW AND TENDER I BECAME I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CAME IN AND JUST
233-134440-0056_7264-92316-0026 TOUCHED ME WITH HER HAND I WOULD PERHAPS FAINT AWAY I ACHED TO FORGIVE AND FORGET WASH WILLIAMS STOPPED AND STOOD STARING AT GEORGE WILLARD
233-134440-0060_1594-135914-0121 YOU SEE WAITING GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR CAME INTO THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG THE LIGHTS FROM THE STORE WINDOWS LAY BRIGHT AND SHINING ON THE SIDEWALKS PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT LAUGHING AND TALKING
233-134440-0061_8014-112602-0031 THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
233-155990-0004_1926-147979-0014 TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
233-155990-0006_118-47824-0029 YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
233-155990-0007_4267-72637-0011 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0009_201-122255-0012 IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
233-155990-0011_6367-74004-0017 AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
233-155990-0012_3982-182255-0001 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0014_1992-141719-0006 ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
233-155990-0016_7511-102420-0005 OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
233-155990-0017_1040-133433-0017 EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
233-155990-0027_6415-116629-0010 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0028_6272-70168-0033 AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
233-155990-0029_1867-154075-0039 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
233-155990-0030_6272-70168-0021 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
233-155990-0033_8312-279790-0047 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0034_1624-142933-0012 THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0036_460-172359-0000 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUDAN VALUED INDEPENDENCE ONLY BECAUSE IT DESIRED TO WAR AGAINST ALL CHRISTIANS AND TO CARRY ON AN UNLIMITED SLAVE TRADE
233-155990-0037_3807-4955-0007 UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
233-155990-0039_7264-92314-0003 ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
233-155990-0040_1867-148436-0028 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
233-155990-0041_2159-179154-0014 THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
233-155990-0043_2989-138028-0065 IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
233-155990-0044_5390-30096-0028 IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
233-155990-0046_5463-39174-0018 BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
2384-152900-0000_4362-15663-0033 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
2384-152900-0001_8630-305213-0042 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002_8975-270782-0106 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0007_6415-116629-0005 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008_6078-54007-0046 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0010_8419-293469-0025 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011_7148-59157-0007 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0014_831-130746-0037 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0017_7505-258958-0023 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0018_5688-15787-0032 I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
2384-152900-0022_32-4137-0052 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023_26-496-0014 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0024_2989-138028-0067 WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
2384-152900-0025_226-122538-0013 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0027_196-122150-0040 IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
2384-152900-0032_7067-76048-0011 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0036_3214-167606-0029 WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
2384-152900-0037_7447-91186-0004 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0039_5750-100289-0006 IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
2384-152900-0041_6367-65536-0028 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0042_8095-274348-0002 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0043_2136-5140-0017 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0046_4214-7146-0012 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047_32-21634-0004 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0049_4051-10927-0006 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0052_7780-274562-0098 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053_441-128988-0011 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0059_1235-135884-0038 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0062_7302-86814-0016 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0064_669-129074-0025 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065_8123-275193-0005 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0066_3112-9555-0004 IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0073_32-21625-0002 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0075_307-127535-0005 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0079_2952-408-0006 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0081_441-130108-0033 TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
2384-152900-0082_1235-135887-0026 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083_248-130652-0030 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2391-145015-0000_8770-295463-0016 STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
2391-145015-0005_2817-142371-0068 NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0008_1926-147979-0027 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0011_1098-133695-0040 ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0012_1081-125237-0001 ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
2391-145015-0013_32-21634-0013 BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014_103-1240-0030 AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0016_19-198-0031 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017_2910-131096-0080 MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0019_7402-90848-0026 SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0021_8770-295465-0022 THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
2391-145015-0024_311-124404-0073 THIS MIGHT IMPLY A HIGHER STYLE OF LIVING IN OUR DAYS THAN IT DID IN THEIRS THERE WERE THEN NO ASSESSED TAXES THE CARRIAGE ONCE BOUGHT ENTAILED LITTLE FURTHER EXPENSE AND THE HORSES PROBABLY LIKE MISTER BENNET'S WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED ON FARM WORK
2391-145015-0025_1743-142912-0025 MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0027_6415-116629-0039 THE FAMILY LIVED IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH TWO COUSINS EDWARD AND JANE COOPER THE CHILDREN OF MISSUS AUSTEN'S ELDEST SISTER AND DOCTOR COOPER THE VICAR OF SONNING NEAR READING THE COOPERS LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT BATH
2391-145015-0028_2289-152258-0017 I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0031_4853-29413-0025 JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0033_2136-5147-0014 WHO MUST HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER VARIETY INTO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER AUSTEN'S ONLY SISTER MISSUS HANCOCK
2391-145015-0034_4267-72637-0033 OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0037_8630-305213-0016 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0039_4397-15678-0018 THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
2391-145015-0040_8098-278252-0010 HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041_1926-143879-0025 AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0043_3240-131231-0016 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0045_4853-27671-0022 HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
2391-145015-0046_405-130894-0063 THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0050_2002-139469-0091 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0052_3235-28452-0017 WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053_2182-150130-0012 AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0054_730-360-0044 ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I MIGHT ATTEMPT OF THE FAMILY LIFE AT STEVENTON WHICH CLOSED SOON AFTER I WAS BORN COULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A FANCY PIECE
2391-145015-0055_8629-261139-0005 WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0058_248-130697-0028 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059_248-130697-0034 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0060_211-122442-0044 BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
2391-145015-0061_4481-17499-0018 NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0063_1723-141149-0108 AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE FAMILY DINNER FOR MANY GENERATIONS
2391-145015-0065_1502-122619-0010 POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0066_5390-30096-0019 AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
2391-145015-0068_6529-62554-0038 IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0071_374-180298-0047 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0072_87-121553-0017 THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
2391-145015-0074_5778-54535-0045 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0075_4788-91208-0003 AS IF IT WERE A NATURAL PRODUCTION WITH LESS FASTIDIOUSNESS AS TO THE QUALITY OF MUSIC LIGHTS AND FLOOR MANY COUNTRY TOWNS HAD A MONTHLY BALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IN SOME OF WHICH THE SAME APARTMENT SERVED FOR DANCING AND TEA ROOM
2391-145015-0077_254-12312-0005 FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0078_5022-29405-0012 AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
2391-145015-0080_1743-142913-0017 TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0081_1040-133433-0039 EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
2391-145015-0082_6880-216547-0083 IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0086_89-219-0035 GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0087_4214-7146-0064 THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
2391-145015-0089_1553-140047-0046 THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0090_3112-9555-0001 AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF CALLING AND LEADING OFF THE FIRST DANCE AND NO LITTLE INDIGNATION WAS FELT AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM WHEN ANY OF THE LEADING COUPLES RETIRED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR DUTIES AND DID NOT CONDESCEND TO DANCE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE SET
2391-145015-0091_6272-70171-0024 WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0095_2911-15045-0002 AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0098_201-127786-0068 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0100_226-131532-0008 A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0102_6209-34600-0016 IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
2391-145015-0108_3983-5331-0014 FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
2391-145015-0110_1963-142393-0039 THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0111_6019-3185-0067 THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
2391-145015-0117_8630-305213-0047 MAY THE KNOT NEVER SLIP NOR THE RING PRESS TOO HARD NOR THE FOOT FIND THE PATTEN A CLOG AT THE TIME WHEN JANE AUSTEN LIVED AT STEVENTON A WORK WAS CARRIED ON IN THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECORDED BECAUSE IT HAS LONG CEASED TO EXIST
2391-145015-0121_1334-135589-0063 IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122_3983-5371-0037 HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
2416-152137-0003_2691-156755-0025 AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
2416-152137-0006_7511-102420-0017 OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
2416-152137-0007_8747-293952-0063 THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
2416-152137-0009_4680-16041-0005 OR ONE OF THOSE JUST PASSING IN THE AISLE IT HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET AS HE HAD STOOPED OVER FOR HIS HAT BUT FROM JUST EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION HE COULD NOT TELL HIS EYES EAGERLY HUNGRILY
2416-152137-0010_5339-14134-0009 CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
2416-152137-0011_4362-15663-0097 WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
2416-152137-0012_3242-67153-0004 WITH AN EFFORT HE CHOKED BACK THE BITTER IMPOTENT LAUGH THAT ROSE TO HIS LIPS THEY WERE TALKING LAUGHING AROUND HIM HER VOICE YES
2416-152137-0014_6081-42010-0011 EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
2416-152137-0016_1355-39947-0054 OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
2416-152137-0017_2092-145706-0067 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0021_8123-275216-0045 WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
2416-152137-0022_8312-279791-0003 AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK
2416-152137-0026_8063-274112-0007 AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0027_5652-19215-0001 WHAT SUDDEN EMERGENCY WAS THE GRAY SEAL CALLED UPON TO FACE THIS TIME WHAT ROLE UNREHEARSED WITHOUT WARNING MUST HE PLAY WHAT STORY OF GRIM
2416-152137-0030_3486-166446-0009 INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
2416-152137-0033_8747-293952-0061 THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
2416-152139-0000_4160-14187-0007 HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS
2416-152139-0002_3235-28452-0025 I WANT TO SEE MISTER THOMAS H CARLING CASHIER OF THE HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SAID JIMMIE DALE EARNESTLY I AM MISTER CARLING REPLIED THE OTHER WHAT IS IT

2416-152139-0007_6818-76332-0031 WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
2416-152139-0008_3830-12530-0007 AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK

2436-2481-0022_1898-145724-0019 TORTURED SLEEP I WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF MY ALARM BUZZER SOMEONE WAS TAMPERING WITH MY DOOR THEN THE BUZZER CEASED THE MARAUDER OUTSIDE MUST HAVE FOUND A WAY OF SILENCING IT BUT IT HAD DONE ITS WORK AWAKENED ME
2436-2481-0024_3436-172171-0060 THE SIZZLING WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE MY DOOR SEAL WAS BREAKING UPON IMPULSE I REACHED FOR THE DOOR JERKED IT OPEN NO ONE THERE
2436-2481-0025_87-121553-0014 WAS EMPTY BUT I LEAPED AND STRUCK A SOLID BODY CROUCHING IN THE DOORWAY A GIANT MAN
2436-2481-0026_289-121665-0044 HIS ELECTRONIZED METALLIC ROBE BURNED MY HANDS I LUNGED AGAINST HIM I WAS ALMOST AS SURPRISED AS HE I SHOT BUT THE STAB OF HEAT EVIDENTLY MISSED HIM THE SHOCK OF MY ENCOUNTER SHORT CIRCUITED HIS ROBE HE MATERIALIZED IN THE STARLIGHT A BRIEF
2436-2481-0027_1737-142397-0042 SAVAGE ENCOUNTER HE STRUCK THE WEAPON FROM MY HAND HE HAD DROPPED HIS HYDROGEN TORCH AND TRIED TO GRIP ME BUT I TWISTED AWAY FROM HIS HOLD SO IT'S YOU QUIET GREGG HALJAN I ONLY WANT TO TALK WITHOUT WARNING A STAB OF RADIANCE SHOT FROM A WEAPON IN HIS HAND

2436-2481-0033_8419-286676-0022 MIKO GOT INTO HER STATEROOM AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS LOVE UPON HER SHE REPULSED HIM HE KILLED HER IT STRUCK ME BLANK AND THEN WITH A RUSH CAME THE THOUGHT
2436-2481-0034_248-130644-0002 WE MUST GET HIM I GATHERED MY WITS A SURGE OF HATE SWEPT ME A WILD DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE WHY BY GOD WHERE IS HE
2436-2481-0037_7800-283478-0022 THE DOOR OF THE SHINING GARDEN WAS CLOSED A BRIEF GLIMPSE GIVEN TO ME AND TO HER OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND NOW
248-130644-0000_8051-295385-0030 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0001_1334-135589-0072 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0004_3857-180923-0012 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005_4051-11218-0029 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0007_2989-138028-0049 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008_7447-91186-0025 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0011_1235-135887-0024 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0013_3982-182255-0011 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014_7800-283493-0016 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0017_8747-293952-0093 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0021_6415-111615-0031 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0022_3168-173565-0016 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023_8051-119902-0006 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0024_4014-186176-0020 IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
248-130644-0028_211-122442-0073 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029_3374-298026-0021 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0031_1624-168623-0011 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032_3240-131231-0064 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0033_3807-4955-0012 SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
248-130644-0034_5339-14133-0020 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130652-0001_5163-39921-0004 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0003_839-130898-0036 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0005_5456-62043-0020 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006_27-124992-0066 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0008_1081-125237-0052 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0013_5703-47198-0054 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0015_2518-154826-0012 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016_4051-11218-0059 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017_7447-91187-0005 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0019_7059-77897-0001 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020_4640-19187-0023 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021_5514-19193-0024 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0023_4813-248641-0010 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024_8609-262281-0033 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025_587-41611-0020 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0027_696-92939-0015 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0029_226-131533-0013 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0032_4214-7146-0034 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033_254-27760-0003 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034_2817-142371-0011 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035_1841-179183-0001 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0037_5750-100289-0072 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0039_298-126791-0057 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000_587-41619-0010 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0002_6880-216547-0079 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003_4137-11701-0051 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0005_4014-186175-0008 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0009_8975-270782-0024 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0012_1235-135883-0047 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013_1737-142396-0015 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0015_1624-142933-0028 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016_5789-57195-0008 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017_2518-154825-0007 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0019_5049-25947-0106 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0022_6019-3185-0060 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023_5049-25947-0068 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0025_1081-125237-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0029_6385-220959-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0031_6454-120342-0027 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0033_1970-28415-0013 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
250-140277-0002_3112-9555-0080 AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN

250-140277-0005_8051-119902-0033 NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
250-140277-0006_7312-92432-0003 RATHER THAN THE ABIDING SUBSTANCE OF SPIRITUALITY READERS OF THESE PAGES WILL FIND NOTHING ABOUT TRANCES ECSTASIES AND OTHER RARE PSYCHIC PHENOMENA WHICH SOMETIMES INDICATE HOLINESS AND SOMETIMES ONLY DISEASE
250-140277-0009_27-123349-0005 THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
250-140277-0010_625-132118-0007 AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
250-140277-0011_1034-121119-0039 THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
250-140277-0012_3830-12530-0013 AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES

250-142276-0004_403-128339-0003 AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
250-142276-0005_696-92939-0016 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0007_3857-182315-0020 MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
250-142276-0008_3242-8112-0043 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0011_669-129061-0008 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0014_5688-41232-0027 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0025_6454-93938-0003 AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
250-142276-0027_1334-135589-0012 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE

250-142276-0030_405-130894-0077 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0036_60-121082-0062 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0038_5688-15787-0013 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039_374-180299-0031 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0041_198-209-0015 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0044_32-21634-0008 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045_6272-70171-0001 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0047_839-130898-0034 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0050_8324-286682-0036 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0053_5778-54535-0019 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054_6437-66173-0058 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0055_5808-54425-0011 BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
250-142276-0056_1116-137572-0021 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057_4481-17499-0019 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0058_5390-24512-0047 THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
250-142276-0060_4830-25904-0043 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0062_7278-104730-0020 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063_2159-179157-0005 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
250-142286-0004_6531-61334-0120 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
250-142286-0005_7190-90542-0076 BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
250-142286-0007_200-124139-0028 MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
250-142286-0008_103-1240-0047 WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
250-142286-0009_1992-141719-0021 THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
250-142286-0011_1578-6379-0039 WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
250-142286-0012_4018-107312-0001 MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
250-142286-0013_3374-298025-0022 AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
250-142286-0015_1926-147979-0034 HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
250-142286-0016_6925-80680-0020 FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
250-142286-0018_4297-13009-0020 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
250-142286-0019_911-128684-0042 AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
250-142286-0020_5652-19215-0058 AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
250-142286-0023_4397-15668-0035 FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
250-142286-0026_1040-133433-0055 BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
250-142286-0028_6836-61804-0016 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
250-142286-0031_1355-39947-0028 EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
2514-149482-0001_3526-176651-0014 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0005_3214-167606-0000 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006_201-122255-0009 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007_8063-274112-0018 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008_405-130894-0015 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009_458-126305-0041 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010_1069-133709-0045 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011_4640-19189-0009 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0014_6078-54013-0028 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015_5652-39938-0050 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016_4898-20016-0023 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0019_5561-41616-0030 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0021_3526-176653-0028 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0025_7226-86964-0015 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026_1723-141149-0100 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027_5104-33407-0031 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028_8014-112602-0020 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029_7113-86041-0096 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030_5104-33407-0012 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0033_3983-5371-0035 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034_3235-28452-0016 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035_302-123504-0013 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0040_7367-86737-0037 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0042_3947-13260-0020 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043_1737-146161-0012 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0047_7800-283493-0011 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048_39-121914-0035 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049_6563-63821-0044 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050_5789-70653-0015 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0056_39-121914-0025 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057_6272-70168-0013 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058_3374-298025-0012 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059_5322-7680-0031 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060_3240-131231-0047 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061_1235-135887-0022 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0063_6000-55211-0036 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064_1963-142776-0006 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0066_2518-154826-0026 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0068_1040-133433-0057 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069_412-126975-0028 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070_254-27760-0006 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071_8770-295463-0003 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072_2007-132570-0053 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0075_8226-274369-0051 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076_248-130697-0011 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077_6064-300880-0008 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0079_7402-90848-0041 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080_4018-107312-0005 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0082_27-124992-0050 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0085_1235-135887-0010 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0087_1723-141149-0017 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088_6563-285357-0009 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0090_2911-7601-0047 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091_8051-295385-0025 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0094_7517-100429-0025 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095_4362-15663-0017 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0097_4441-76262-0027 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098_7190-90542-0054 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0100_7278-104730-0017 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101_254-12312-0019 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102_6529-62554-0008 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103_8419-293473-0019 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104_730-359-0019 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0106_4088-158077-0031 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107_3440-171009-0074 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
2518-154825-0000_6437-66173-0019 HOW FEARFUL AND DIZZY TIS TO CAST ONE'S EYES SO LOW I'LL LOOK NO MORE
2518-154825-0002_307-127540-0008 AND TWAS ONLY SHOOTING AT A VENTURE WE WERE SAFE BUT FOR HOW SHORT A TIME SAFE JUST FOR SO LONG AS IT SHOULD PLEASE THE SOLDIERS NOT TO COME DOWN TO TAKE US
2518-154825-0003_3857-182315-0044 SAFE WITH A DISCHARGED PISTOL IN OUR GRASP AND A SHOT MAN LYING AT OUR FEET ELZEVIR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK CAN YOU STAND JOHN IS THE BONE BROKEN
2518-154825-0005_6880-216547-0053 EVER SO LITTLE IT CAUSED ME SHARP PAIN FOR FEELING WAS COMING BACK AFTER THE FIRST NUMBNESS OF THE SHOT THEY HAVE BROKE THE LEG THOUGH IT BLEEDS LITTLE ELZEVIR SAID WE HAVE NO TIME TO SPLICE IT HERE
2518-154825-0006_3723-171631-0033 BUT I WILL PUT A KERCHIEF ROUND AND WHILE I WRAP IT LISTEN TO HOW WE LIE AND THEN CHOOSE WHAT WE SHALL DO I NODDED BITING MY LIPS HARD TO CONCEAL THE PAIN HE GAVE ME AND HE WENT ON
2518-154825-0009_6454-93938-0006 AND THEREFORE DO NOT BLAME THEE IF THOU DIDST MAKE ME WASTE A CHARGE IN AIR SO ONE THING WE CAN DO IS TO WAIT HERE UNTIL THEY COME AND I CAN ACCOUNT FOR A FEW OF THEM BEFORE THEY SHOOT ME DOWN BUT THOU CANST NOT FIGHT WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0010_3947-13262-0049 AND THEY WILL TAKE THEE ALIVE AND THEN THERE IS A DANCE ON AIR AT DORCHESTER JAIL I FELT SICK WITH PAIN AND BITTERLY CAST DOWN TO THINK THAT I WAS LIKE TO COME SO SOON TO SUCH A VILE END
2518-154825-0013_5703-47212-0019 JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
2518-154825-0017_7067-76048-0036 IT WAS A DESPERATE CHANCE ENOUGH BUT CAME AS WELCOME AS A PATCH OF BLUE THROUGH LOWERING SKIES YES I SAID DEAR MASTER ELZEVIR LET US GET TO IT QUICKLY AND IF WE FALL
2518-154825-0018_211-122425-0013 TIS BETTER FAR TO DIE UPON THE ROCKS BELOW THAN TO WAIT HERE FOR THEM TO HALE US OFF TO JAIL AND WITH THAT I TRIED TO STAND THINKING I MIGHT GO DOT AND CARRY EVEN WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0022_4898-20016-0022 FAUGH SAID ELZEVIR TIS A POOR BEAST HAS LOST HIS FOOTHOLD IT WAS AN ILL OMEN ENOUGH AND I SAID AS MUCH BESEECHING HIM TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY UP THE ZIGZAG
2518-154825-0025_8419-286676-0015 WILL KEEP THEM IN CHECK A LITTLE WHILE THEY TRY TO BRING THE LIFE BACK TO SO GOOD A MAN BUT IF WE FALL WHY WE SHALL FALL TOGETHER AND OUTWIT THEIR CUNNING
2518-154825-0026_4160-14187-0024 SO SHUT THY EYES AND KEEP THEM TIGHT UNTIL I BID THEE OPEN THEM WITH THAT HE CAUGHT ME UP AGAIN AND I SHUT MY EYES FIRM REBUKING MYSELF FOR MY FAINT HEARTEDNESS AND NOT TELLING HIM HOW MUCH MY FOOT HURT ME
2518-154825-0030_3607-29116-0034 AND THEN THE PATH GREW STEEPER AND STEEPER AND ELZEVIR WENT SLOWER AND SLOWER TILL AT LAST HE SPOKE JOHN I AM GOING TO STOP
2518-154825-0034_7264-92316-0042 BUT SPENT MUCH TIME THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS IN TRAVELLING THOSE TEN YARDS TO TAKE ME ROUND THE FIRST ELBOW OF THE PATH FOR MY FOOT WAS HEAVY AND GAVE ME FIERCE PAIN TO DRAG THOUGH I TRIED TO MASK IT FROM ELZEVIR AND HE
2518-154825-0036_5322-7679-0023 BUT HERE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY FOR THE PATH WAS STILL SO NARROW AND THE CLIFF WALL SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE ME UP IN HIS ARMS SO I LAY FLAT ON MY FACE AND HE STEPPED OVER ME SETTING HIS FOOT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS TO DO IT
2518-154825-0037_307-127539-0024 AND THEN WHILE HE KNELT DOWN UPON THE PATH
2518-154825-0038_6454-107462-0007 PUTTING MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND SO HE BORE ME PICKABACK I SHUT MY EYES FIRM AGAIN AND THUS WE MOVED ALONG ANOTHER SPELL MOUNTING STILL AND FEELING THE WIND STILL FRESHENING
2518-154825-0040_8425-287387-0008 I SAW THE BLUE SEA TWINKLING LIKE A DAZZLING MIRROR AND THE GULLS WHEELING ABOUT THE SHEER CHALK WALL AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THAT BLOATED CARCASS OF A SHEEP THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THIS VERY SPOT PERHAPS AND IN AN INSTANT
2518-154825-0041_5778-54535-0024 FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF
2518-154825-0046_460-172357-0016 LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME
2518-154825-0049_211-122442-0007 I KNEW THAT IT WAS MOVING THE LITTLE TUFTS OF BENT GRASS AND THE CHIDING CRIES OF THE GULLS SEEMED TO INVITE ME TO BE DONE WITH FEAR AND PAIN AND BROKEN LEG AND FLING MYSELF OFF ON TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEN ELZEVIR SPOKE JOHN HE SAID
2518-154825-0054_27-123349-0009 IT IS ALL UP ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEY WILL SEE US BUT SO STRANGE IS THE FORCE OF MIND ON BODY AND THE POWER OF A GREATER TO MASTER A LESSER FEAR THAT WHEN I HEARD THOSE VOICES FROM BELOW ALL FRIGHT OF FALLING LEFT ME IN A MOMENT
2518-154825-0056_5750-35690-0027 THINKING THAT WE WERE HIDING BY THE SEA FIVE MINUTES LATER ELZEVIR STEPPED ON TO THE CLIFF TOP WITH ME UPON HIS BACK WE HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF THIS THROW HE SAID AND ARE SAFE FOR ANOTHER HOUR THOUGH I THOUGHT THY GIDDY HEAD HAD RUINED US
2518-154826-0000_839-130898-0095 THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
2518-154826-0005_2391-145015-0101 THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP
2518-154826-0006_460-172359-0018 AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY
2518-154826-0007_5688-15787-0005 THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE
2518-154826-0009_2002-139469-0086 THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
2518-154826-0010_2514-149482-0089 IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS
2518-154826-0011_4088-158077-0008 THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR
2518-154826-0015_2952-410-0045 SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP
2518-154826-0020_2893-139322-0021 THEN I SOUGHT SOMETHING TO FIX MY THOUGHTS AND LOOKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL WHERE THE SWARD WAS FELL TO COUNTING THE MOLE HILLS THAT WERE CAST UP IN NUMBERS THEREABOUT AND WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THEM AND RECKONED UP THIRTY LITTLE HEAPS OF DRY AND POWDERY BROWN EARTH
2518-154826-0021_78-369-0011 THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY
2518-154826-0022_1502-122619-0073 BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG
2518-154826-0023_3259-158083-0098 AND THOUGH I COULD SEE NOTHING I KNEW THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED VERY NEAR US I WAS FOR WAKING ELZEVIR BUT HE WAS ALREADY FULL AWAKE AND PUT A FINGER ON HIS LIP TO SHOW I SHOULD NOT SPEAK THEN
2518-154826-0028_1447-17506-0018 NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY
2518-154826-0029_1334-135589-0035 AND HIS VOICE HAD SOMETHING OF SURPRISE IN IT NAY BUT MY SHOT ARE OVER SMALL

2518-154826-0031_8098-275181-0023 THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION
2518-154826-0032_4051-11218-0060 FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK
2518-154826-0033_8580-287364-0024 THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
2518-154826-0037_5652-19215-0054 WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE
2518-154826-0038_481-123720-0034 AND IN THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS WE HAD SLEPT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT FOR THE SUN WAS WESTERING FAST AND THOUGH THE REST HAD REFRESHED ME MY LEG HAD GROWN STIFF AND HURT THE MORE IN DANGLING WHEN WE STARTED AGAIN
2518-154826-0040_8838-298546-0020 ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
2518-154826-0041_911-130578-0004 AND I AM TOLD IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL AND THE WAY OF MAKING A MARBLE QUARRY IS TO SINK A TUNNEL SLANTING VERY STEEPLY DOWN INTO THE EARTH LIKE A WELL TURNED ASKEW TILL YOU REACH FIFTY SEVENTY OR PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP THEN
2518-154826-0046_2289-152258-0013 ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
2518-154826-0047_8098-278252-0000 FOR IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS HOLY PURPOSE THE MANDRIVE WOULD HAVE POWER TO STRANGLE THE MAN THAT HEWED IT IT WAS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE OLD SHAFTS THAT ELZEVIR LAID ME DOWN AT LAST THE LIGHT WAS VERY LOW
2518-154826-0051_1841-159771-0021 AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN
2518-154826-0054_302-123516-0009 AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH

254-12312-0009_5703-47212-0038 AND NOW CONSIDER I DO YOU EXHORT IN SUCH COMMOTIONS SO CONTINUAL WHAT REST CAN TAKE THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL MOST HAPPY THEN ARE THEY THAT CAN IT HOLD AND USE IT CAREFULLY AS PRECIOUS GOLD
254-12312-0010_6454-120342-0024 BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT

254-127705-0001_5456-24741-0018 WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
254-127705-0003_5688-41232-0059 INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
254-127705-0004_298-126791-0059 TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
254-127705-0006_4853-27670-0001 MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES

254-127705-0012_2843-152918-0039 AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
254-127705-0013_19-227-0042 AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
254-127705-0016_1737-142397-0003 MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
254-127705-0019_3983-5371-0008 AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
254-127705-0020_8468-295198-0008 POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
254-127705-0024_7511-102420-0025 SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
254-127705-0026_7178-34645-0005 THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
254-127705-0028_233-155990-0013 AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
254-127705-0031_6064-300880-0005 WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
254-127705-0032_3982-182255-0012 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
254-127705-0034_8312-279791-0018 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
254-127705-0036_5393-19219-0023 WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
254-127705-0037_2514-149482-0018 DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
254-127705-0039_8123-275209-0010 THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
254-127705-0040_7447-91186-0031 BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
254-127705-0041_7302-86815-0058 AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
254-145458-0000_163-122947-0046 IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
254-145458-0002_696-93314-0010 ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
254-145458-0003_6272-70191-0035 IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
254-145458-0005_118-47824-0018 LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
254-145458-0007_6563-63821-0040 WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
254-145458-0009_3723-171631-0011 IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
254-145458-0011_298-126791-0030 LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
254-145458-0015_332-128985-0049 TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
254-145458-0020_8095-274346-0010 BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
254-27760-0002_446-123501-0047 THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
254-27760-0004_5688-41232-0065 AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
254-27760-0008_7402-59171-0013 HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
254-27760-0009_8088-284756-0054 HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
254-27760-0010_6181-216552-0105 NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
254-27760-0011_3440-171009-0043 THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
254-27760-0013_3607-29116-0031 I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING
254-27760-0019_2514-149482-0023 AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK
254-27760-0021_1723-141149-0097 BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
254-27760-0022_7178-34645-0011 THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
254-27760-0024_1743-142914-0034 TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
254-27760-0025_1963-142393-0047 HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
254-27760-0030_8063-274115-0017 TAUGHT HIM TO READ WRITE COUNT UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EVEN TO DANCE THE QUADRILLE WHEN PELAGUEYA DIED THEY PLACED THE ORPHAN VANKA IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND FROM THE KITCHEN HE WAS SENT TO MOSCOW
254-27760-0031_7800-283493-0020 AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE
254-27760-0033_6415-116629-0033 FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
254-27760-0034_3723-171115-0035 AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
26-495-0000_1034-121119-0014 IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
26-495-0004_3947-13260-0017 AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
26-495-0013_441-130108-0036 THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
26-495-0014_8312-279790-0007 THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
26-495-0017_229-130880-0061 SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
26-495-0023_2989-138035-0042 STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
26-495-0024_7059-77900-0037 FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
26-495-0025_6476-96661-0022 THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
26-495-0027_4788-94904-0018 THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
26-495-0028_1447-130552-0010 BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
26-495-0029_3440-171009-0017 SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
26-495-0030_412-126975-0046 BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
26-495-0033_198-126831-0029 A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
26-495-0035_2817-142371-0070 OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
26-495-0036_6880-216547-0112 IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
26-495-0037_7302-86815-0028 COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
26-495-0038_5561-41616-0026 WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
26-495-0039_1334-135589-0069 AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
26-495-0040_1743-142912-0013 THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
26-495-0042_1502-122619-0059 NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
26-495-0043_8580-287363-0009 THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
26-495-0045_5703-47198-0046 CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
26-495-0047_307-127539-0027 TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
26-495-0051_2159-179157-0024 BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
26-495-0052_4680-16041-0040 WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
26-495-0053_1898-145715-0018 AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
26-495-0054_2092-145706-0076 THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
26-495-0056_27-124992-0053 I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
26-495-0059_3214-167606-0007 SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
26-495-0065_5463-39173-0013 FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
26-495-0067_8609-262281-0016 MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
26-495-0069_311-124404-0024 I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
26-495-0070_196-122159-0012 ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
26-495-0075_2384-152900-0003 AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
26-495-0077_730-359-0035 WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
26-495-0082_374-180299-0042 IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
26-495-0083_3168-173565-0040 BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
26-495-0086_8630-305213-0044 THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
26-495-0090_3526-176653-0050 SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
26-496-0001_4014-186176-0008 FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
26-496-0002_6454-120342-0021 OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
26-496-0003_3112-9555-0025 BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
26-496-0004_198-126831-0009 YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
26-496-0005_2893-139322-0031 AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
26-496-0008_3699-47246-0016 THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
26-496-0009_4088-158077-0009 WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
26-496-0015_3879-173592-0014 BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
26-496-0023_6147-34607-0030 ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
26-496-0024_2391-145015-0113 TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
26-496-0025_1363-135842-0048 AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
2691-156745-0001_8226-274369-0061 THE REPORT OF OUR AFFLICTION SPREAD RAPIDLY AND THE WELL MEANING TENDER HEARTED WOMEN AT THE FORT CAME TO CONDOLE AND WEEP WITH US AND MADE THEIR CHILDREN WEEP ALSO BY URGING

2691-156745-0003_460-172359-0073 I WOULD RUSH OFF ALONE AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TORTURING SYMPATHY EVEN THERE I MET THOSE WHO WOULD LOOK AT ME WITH GREAT SERIOUS EYES SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND MOURNFULLY SAY YOU POOR LITTLE MITE
2691-156745-0005_4830-25904-0044 AND I KNEW THAT MOTHER DID NOT WANT ME TO BE THERE EITHER HAD SHE NOT SENT ME AWAY TO SAVE ME AND ASKED GOD OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME
2691-156745-0008_2002-139469-0020 BUT ALSO OF HAVING WANTONLY TAKEN THE LIFE OF MISSUS MURPHY AND OF MY MOTHER SOME DECLARED HIM CRAZY OTHERS CALLED HIM A MONSTER KESEBERG DENIED THESE CHARGES AND
2691-156745-0009_8312-279790-0038 HE STATED THAT MISSUS MURPHY HAD DIED OF STARVATION SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD RELIEF AND THAT MY MOTHER HAD WATCHED BY FATHER'S BEDSIDE UNTIL HE DIED
2691-156745-0014_8975-270782-0018 SAVED HIM FROM PERSONAL VIOLENCE BUT NOT FROM SUSPICION AND ILL WILL WOMEN SHUNNED HIM AND CHILDREN STONED HIM AS HE WALKED ABOUT THE FORT THE CALIFORNIA STAR PRINTED IN FULL THE ACCOUNT OF THE FALLON PARTY
2691-156745-0015_5867-48852-0051 AND BLOOD CURDLING EDITORIALS INCREASED PUBLIC SENTIMENT AGAINST KESEBERG STAMPING HIM WITH THE MARK OF CAIN AND CLOSING THE DOOR OF EVERY HOME AGAINST HIM
2691-156745-0017_7780-274562-0025 MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS FOR US WERE BREWING AT THE FORT FALLON'S PARTY DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT OF ITS CLAIM IT HAD GONE UP THE MOUNTAINS UNDER PROMISE THAT ITS MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE NOT ONLY A PER DIEM AS RESCUERS

2691-156755-0027_3168-173564-0004 I HAVE A FAINT RECOLLECTION OF LISTENING TO THE CHIMES OF THE WEDDING BELLS AND LATER OF HEARING THAT CAPTAIN FRISBIE HAD TAKEN HIS BRIDE AWAY BUT THAT IS ALL FOR ABOUT THAT TIME DEAR OLD JAKIE RETURNED TO US IN ILL HEALTH AND OUR THOUGHTS AND CARE TURNED TO HIM
2691-156755-0030_887-123291-0009 NO SOONER WOULD I COMMENCE OPERATIONS THAN THE BRANCHES SLIPPING FROM UNDER THE STICK WOULD BRUSH GEORGIA'S FACE AND STRIKE MY HANDS AND ARMS WITH STINGING FORCE AND BY THE TIME WE HAD SECURED THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF ROOTS WE WERE COVERED WITH FIERY WELTS
2691-156755-0032_2836-5354-0004 AND ANGRILY DEMANDED THE CONTENTS OF OUR BASKET WE OPENED IT AND WHEN HE SAW WHAT IT CONTAINED HE STAMPED HIS WABBLING FOOT AND MOTIONED US TO BE OFF WE OBEYED WITH ALACRITY FOR IT WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A DRUNKEN INDIAN
2691-156755-0033_1116-137572-0027 AND GREATLY ALARMED US THE TEA MAY HAVE EASED JAKIE'S PAIN BUT IT DID NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE HAD HOPED
2691-156755-0035_3699-19401-0000 GRANDPA HAD THE GRAVE ENCLOSED WITH A WHITE PALING AND WE CHILDREN PLANTED CASTILIAN ROSE BUSHES AT THE HEAD AND FOOT OF THE MOUND AND CARRIED WATER TO THEM FROM THE HOUSE AND IN TIME THEIR BRANCHES MET AND THE GRAVE WAS A BED OF FRAGRANT BLOSSOMS
27-123349-0003_3436-172162-0032 AND HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT EVEN IN THE FIELD EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SURPRISE HE WOULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF A COUNCIL OF WAR MONMOUTH WAS TO COMMAND IN ENGLAND HIS SOFT MIND HAD AS USUAL
27-123349-0006_4680-16042-0008 ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
27-123349-0007_8629-261139-0036 THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
27-123349-0011_4406-16883-0037 SHOULD ACCOMPANY ARGYLE TO SCOTLAND AND THAT FLETCHER SHOULD GO WITH MONMOUTH TO ENGLAND FLETCHER FROM THE BEGINNING HAD AUGURED ILL OF THE ENTERPRISE BUT HIS CHIVALROUS SPIRIT WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECLINE A RISK WHICH HIS FRIENDS SEEMED EAGER TO ENCOUNTER
27-123349-0012_6880-216547-0031 WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
27-123349-0013_1455-134435-0047 RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
27-123349-0015_1081-125237-0015 BUT HIS INTELLECT AND HIS TEMPER PRESERVED HIM FROM THE VIOLENCE OF A PARTISAN HE HAD LIVED ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH SHAFTESBURY AND HAD THUS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT LOCKE'S PRUDENCE HAD HOWEVER
27-123349-0016_4160-11549-0035 BEEN SUCH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE TO BRING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE CORRUPT AND PARTIAL TRIBUNALS OF THAT AGE IN ONE POINT HOWEVER HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS A STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
27-123349-0019_5049-25947-0021 THAT NEVER MAN WAS SO COMPLETE A MASTER OF HIS TONGUE AND OF HIS PASSIONS WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TREACHERY COULD DO NOTHING ARBITRARY POWER WAS USED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO INVEIGLE LOCKE INTO A FAULT
27-123349-0023_374-180298-0027 BUT IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT ARGYLE WOULD SHORTLY APPEAR IN ARMS AMONG HIS CLANSMEN A PROCLAMATION WAS ACCORDINGLY ISSUED DIRECTING THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD BE PUT INTO A STATE OF DEFENCE THE MILITIA WAS ORDERED TO BE IN READINESS
27-123349-0025_1737-148989-0036 AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
27-123349-0027_4640-19189-0033 THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
27-123349-0030_5561-39621-0022 WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
27-123349-0031_6367-74004-0018 JAMES HAD LATELY HELD LANGUAGE WHICH ENCOURAGED THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT PATIENTLY SUBMIT TO THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD CONSENT TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES AND THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
27-123349-0032_7190-90542-0035 THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
27-123349-0033_7402-90848-0010 BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
27-123349-0034_1363-135842-0034 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING IMMEDIATE EXIGENCIES HAD NEVER BEEN DELIBERATELY REVISED AND PERFECTED IN A TIME OF TRANQUILLITY EVERY ONE OF THE SEVEN COMMONWEALTHS
27-123349-0037_3699-19401-0014 HOLLAND ALONE CONTAINED EIGHTEEN CITIES EACH OF WHICH WAS FOR MANY PURPOSES AN INDEPENDENT STATE JEALOUS OF ALL INTERFERENCE FROM WITHOUT IF THE RULERS OF SUCH A CITY RECEIVED FROM THE HAGUE AN ORDER
27-123349-0041_3699-47246-0013 AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ANIMATED BY THEIR SPIRIT ALL THE ENDEAVOURS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EFFECT WHAT JAMES DESIRED WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE EVASIONS OF THE FUNCTIONARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND BY THE BLUNDERS OF COLONEL BEVIL SKELTON
27-123349-0042_1992-141719-0034 THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
27-123349-0043_87-121553-0101 WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
27-123349-0044_8629-261139-0074 AND THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REAL WISH AT THE STADTHOUSE OF AMSTERDAM TO PREVENT ARGYLE FROM SAILING NO DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE SKELTON NOW ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE STATES GENERAL THEY SHOWED EVERY DISPOSITION TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND
27-123349-0045_1235-135887-0004 DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
27-123349-0047_5789-57158-0027 WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
27-123349-0049_6925-80680-0003 AND ALLOWED TWO OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO GO ON SHORE THERE THE BISHOP ORDERED THEM TO BE ARRESTED THE REFUGEES PROCEEDED TO HOLD A LONG AND ANIMATED DEBATE ON THIS MISADVENTURE
27-123349-0050_1841-150351-0022 FOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THEIR EXPEDITION HOWEVER LANGUID AND IRRESOLUTE THEIR CONDUCT MIGHT BE THEY NEVER IN DEBATE WANTED SPIRIT OR PERSEVERANCE SOME WERE FOR AN ATTACK ON KIRKWALL
27-123349-0053_2518-154825-0014 WHEN THE EARL REACHED HIS OWN PROVINCE HE FOUND THAT PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO REPEL HIM AT DUNSTAFFNAGE HE SENT HIS SECOND SON CHARLES ON SHORE TO CALL THE CAMPBELLS TO ARMS BUT CHARLES RETURNED WITH GLOOMY TIDINGS
27-123349-0055_2196-174172-0025 OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
27-123349-0057_839-130898-0024 IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
27-124992-0001_233-134440-0051 IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THAT ILLUSTRIOUS WOMAN BY WHOSE VIRTUE AND FORTITUDE AND ARMED WITH PRAYER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE PRESERVED FROM THE DESTRUCTION THREATENED THEM BY HOLOFERNES AND HIS GREAT ARMY
27-124992-0002_3857-182317-0002 SWORE BY HIS THRONE AND KINGDOM THAT HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
27-124992-0004_1867-154075-0029 AND ALL THE GOVERNORS AND HIS OFFICERS OF WAR
27-124992-0006_5652-19215-0061 GO OUT AGAINST ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WEST
27-124992-0009_831-130746-0020 WITH THE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS
27-124992-0013_911-128684-0045 WHO WERE OVER AGAINST THE FACE OF THE DESERT
27-124992-0020_5393-19219-0028 AND BE SUBJECT TO THEE THAN TO DIE AND TO PERISH
27-124992-0024_2911-7601-0037 THAT HE ONLY MIGHT BE CALLED GOD BY THOSE NATIONS WHICH COULD BE BROUGHT UNDER HIM
27-124992-0025_6272-70168-0019 AND ALL APAMEA AND ALL MESOPOTAMIA
27-124992-0029_1723-141149-0007 WROTE TO ALL THAT WERE OVER AGAINST ESDRELON
27-124992-0032_332-128985-0032 AND THEY CAUSED THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO LIE PROSTRATE BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0033_7859-102519-0002 THAT THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT NOT BE MADE A PREY AND THEIR WIVES CARRIED OFF AND THEIR CITIES DESTROYED AND THEIR HOLY THINGS PROFANED
27-124992-0034_446-123502-0043 KNOW YE THAT THE LORD WILL HEAR YOUR PRAYERS
27-124992-0035_3112-9555-0059 THAT TRUSTED IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND IN HIS POWER AND IN HIS ARMY AND IN HIS SHIELDS AND IN HIS CHARIOTS AND IN HIS HORSEMEN NOT BY FIGHTING WITH THE SWORD
27-124992-0038_6529-62554-0047 OR WHAT ARE THEIR CITIES AND OF WHAT SORT AND HOW GREAT ALSO WHAT IS THEIR POWER OR WHAT IS THEIR MULTITUDE
27-124992-0044_5789-57195-0035 SO THAT THE WATERS WERE MADE TO STAND FIRM AS A WALL ON EITHER SIDE
27-124992-0047_4160-11550-0010 AND OF THE HETHITES AND OF THE HEVITES AND OF THE AMORRHITES AND ALL THE MIGHTY ONES IN HESEBON
27-124992-0048_3436-172171-0062 WHEN THEY HAD REVOLTED FROM THE WAY WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN THEM TO WALK THEREIN THEY WERE DESTROYED IN BATTLES BY MANY NATIONS AND VERY MANY OF THEM WERE LED AWAY CAPTIVE
27-124992-0051_4898-28461-0015 WE CANNOT RESIST THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL DEFEND THEM
27-124992-0055_118-47824-0082 AND BESIDES HIM THERE IS NO OTHER JUDITH CHAPTER SIX
27-124992-0056_2182-150130-0021 WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
27-124992-0058_1235-135883-0015 THEN THOU ALSO SHALT DIE WITH THEM BY THE SWORD OF THE ASSYRIANS
27-124992-0070_4014-186175-0004 THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS WHOSE POWER THOU HAST SET FORTH WILL MAKE THIS RETURN TO THEE
27-124992-0071_4830-25898-0045 LET GOD BE WITH THEE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF US THAT AS IT SHALL PLEASE THEE SO THOU WITH ALL THINE
27-124992-0072_3607-29116-0017 AFTER THE ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UP RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOUSE
27-124992-0074_311-124404-0108 AND THEY PRAYED ALL THE NIGHT LONG WITHIN THE CHURCH DESIRING HELP OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
27-124992-0075_5022-29411-0036 THE CHURCH THAT IS THE SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE WHERE THEY MET FOR PRAYER JUDITH CHAPTER SEVEN HOLOFERNES BESIEGETH BETHULIA
27-124992-0076_78-368-0012 AND TWO AND TWENTY THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE PREPARATIONS OF THOSE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN
2764-36616-0001_458-126305-0001 THIS MYSTERY PUZZLED ME FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY VIEWS I DRIFTED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER SOMETHING WAS OUT THERE THAT MUCH WAS CERTAIN AND ANY DOUBTING THOMAS WAS INVITED TO PLACE HIS FINGER ON THE SCOTIA'S WOUND WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK
2764-36616-0002_4014-186176-0034 ALSO DISCREDITED WAS THE IDEA OF A FLOATING HULL OR SOME OTHER ENORMOUS WRECKAGE AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS SPEED OF MOVEMENT SO ONLY TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE QUESTION WERE LEFT CREATING TWO VERY DISTINCT GROUPS OF SUPPORTERS
2764-36616-0004_32-4137-0006 ONLY SOME GOVERNMENT COULD OWN SUCH AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION AND IN THESE DISASTER FILLED TIMES WHEN MEN TAX THEIR INGENUITY TO BUILD INCREASINGLY POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT UNKNOWN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD SOME NATION COULD HAVE BEEN TESTING SUCH A FEARSOME MACHINE
2764-36616-0005_1235-135883-0022 AND THE TORPEDO HAS LED TO THIS UNDERWATER BATTERING RAM WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO THE WORLD PUTTING ITS FOOT DOWN AT LEAST I HOPE IT WILL BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS OF A WAR MACHINE COLLAPSED IN THE FACE OF FORMAL DENIALS FROM THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS
2764-36616-0007_6880-216547-0072 BESIDES HOW COULD THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS UNDERWATER BOAT HAVE ESCAPED PUBLIC NOTICE KEEPING A SECRET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A NATION WHOSE EVERY MOVE IS UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE BY RIVAL POWERS
2764-36616-0010_311-124404-0098 AFTER I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK SEVERAL PEOPLE DID ME THE HONOR OF CONSULTING ME ON THE PHENOMENON IN QUESTION IN FRANCE I HAD PUBLISHED A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ENTITLED THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS WELL RECEIVED IN SCHOLARLY CIRCLES
2764-36616-0012_3486-166446-0005 I CONFINED MYSELF TO A FLAT NO COMMENT BUT SOON PINNED TO THE WALL I HAD TO EXPLAIN MYSELF STRAIGHT OUT AND IN THIS VEIN THE HONORABLE PIERRE ARONNAX PROFESSOR AT THE PARIS MUSEUM WAS SUMMONED BY THE NEW YORK HERALD TO FORMULATE HIS VIEWS NO MATTER WHAT
2764-36616-0013_8630-305213-0008 I COMPLIED SINCE I COULD NO LONGER HOLD MY TONGUE I LET IT WAG I DISCUSSED THE QUESTION IN ITS EVERY ASPECT BOTH POLITICAL AND SCIENTIFIC AND THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE WELL PADDED ARTICLE I PUBLISHED IN THE ISSUE OF APRIL THIRTIETH
2764-36616-0015_7505-258964-0023 THE DEEPEST PARTS OF THE OCEAN ARE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US NO SOUNDINGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH THEM WHAT GOES ON IN THOSE DISTANT DEPTHS WHAT CREATURES INHABIT OR COULD INHABIT THOSE REGIONS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
2764-36616-0016_118-47824-0065 WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THESE ANIMALS IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE HOWEVER THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SUBMITTED TO ME CAN TAKE THE FORM OF A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVES EITHER WE KNOW EVERY VARIETY OF CREATURE POPULATING OUR PLANET OR WE DO NOT
2764-36616-0017_2289-152254-0002 IF WE DO NOT KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM IF NATURE STILL KEEPS ICHTHYOLOGICAL SECRETS FROM US NOTHING IS MORE ADMISSIBLE THAN TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF FISH OR CETACEANS OF NEW SPECIES OR EVEN NEW GENERA ANIMALS WITH A BASICALLY CAST IRON CONSTITUTION
2764-36616-0018_6836-61804-0010 THAT INHABIT STRATA BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR SOUNDINGS AND WHICH SOME DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER AN URGE OR A WHIM IF YOU PREFER CAN BRING TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE OCEAN FOR LONG INTERVALS IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO KNOW EVERY LIVING SPECIES
2764-36616-0019_201-127786-0056 WE MUST LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL IN QUESTION AMONG THOSE MARINE CREATURES ALREADY CATALOGED AND IN THIS EVENT I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF A GIANT NARWHALE
2764-36616-0020_8051-295385-0035 INCREASE ITS DIMENSIONS FIVEFOLD OR EVEN TENFOLD THEN GIVE THIS CETACEAN A STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE WHILE ENLARGING ITS OFFENSIVE WEAPONS AND YOU HAVE THE ANIMAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT WOULD HAVE THE PROPORTIONS DETERMINED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHANNON
2764-36616-0022_5339-14133-0056 WHICH THE NARWHALE ATTACKS WITH INVARIABLE SUCCESS OTHERS HAVE BEEN WRENCHED NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
2764-36616-0023_8123-275193-0024 OWNS ONE OF THESE TUSKS WITH A LENGTH OF TWO POINT TWO FIVE METERS AND A WIDTH AT ITS BASE OF FORTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ALL RIGHT THEN IMAGINE THIS WEAPON TO BE TEN TIMES STRONGER AND THE ANIMAL TEN TIMES MORE POWERFUL
2764-36616-0025_446-123501-0005 NO LONGER ARMED WITH A MERE LANCE BUT WITH AN ACTUAL SPUR LIKE IRONCLAD FRIGATES OR THOSE WARSHIPS CALLED RAMS WHOSE MASS AND MOTOR POWER IT WOULD POSSESS SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENON IS THUS EXPLAINED AWAY
2764-36616-0026_7302-86815-0056 THESE LAST WORDS WERE COWARDLY OF ME BUT AS FAR AS I COULD I WANTED TO PROTECT MY PROFESSORIAL DIGNITY AND NOT LAY MYSELF OPEN TO LAUGHTER FROM THE AMERICANS WHO WHEN THEY DO LAUGH LAUGH RAUCOUSLY
2764-36616-0028_625-132118-0029 MOREOVER THE SOLUTION IT PROPOSED ALLOWED FOR FREE PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION THE HUMAN MIND ENJOYS IMPRESSIVE VISIONS OF UNEARTHLY CREATURES NOW THEN THE SEA IS PRECISELY THEIR BEST MEDIUM
2764-36616-0029_19-227-0023 OUR CREATOR CAST THEM USING A COLOSSAL MOLD THAT TIME HAS GRADUALLY MADE SMALLER WITH ITS UNTOLD DEPTHS COULDN'T THE SEA KEEP ALIVE SUCH HUGE SPECIMENS OF LIFE FROM ANOTHER AGE
2764-36616-0030_8747-293952-0105 CONTINUOUS ALTERATION COULDN'T THE HEART OF THE OCEAN HIDE THE LAST REMAINING VARIETIES OF THESE TITANIC SPECIES FOR WHOM YEARS ARE CENTURIES AND CENTURIES MILLENNIA BUT I MUSTN'T LET THESE FANTASIES RUN AWAY WITH ME
2764-36616-0031_4362-15663-0056 ENOUGH OF THESE FAIRY TALES THAT TIME HAS CHANGED FOR ME INTO HARSH REALITIES I REPEAT OPINION HAD CRYSTALLIZED AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THE PUBLIC ACCEPTED WITHOUT ARGUMENT THE EXISTENCE OF A PRODIGIOUS CREATURE THAT HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FABLED SEA SERPENT
2764-36616-0032_4297-13009-0003 YET IF SOME SAW IT PURELY AS A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED MORE PRACTICAL PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA AND ENGLAND WERE DETERMINED TO PURGE THE OCEAN OF THIS DAUNTING MONSTER TO INSURE THE SAFETY OF TRANSOCEANIC TRAVEL
2764-36616-0034_8580-287363-0027 THE NAVAL ARSENALS WERE UNLOCKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT WHO PRESSED ENERGETICALLY FORWARD WITH THE ARMING OF HIS FRIGATE BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS JUST WHEN A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO CHASE THE MONSTER THE MONSTER PUT IN NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
2764-36616-0038_1246-124548-0031 NOT EVEN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BREATHER WAS GRANTED TO COMMANDER FARRAGUT HIS PROVISIONS WERE LOADED ON BOARD HIS COAL BUNKERS WERE OVERFLOWING NOT A CREWMAN WAS MISSING FROM HIS POST TO CAST OFF HE NEEDED ONLY TO FIRE AND STOKE HIS FURNACES HALF A DAY'S DELAY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFORGIVABLE
2764-36617-0000_311-124404-0120 CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER
2764-36617-0001_4014-186175-0010 I UNDERSTOOD AT LAST THAT MY TRUE VOCATION MY SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO HUNT DOWN THIS DISTURBING MONSTER AND RID THE WORLD OF IT EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
2764-36617-0003_1363-139304-0015 I ACCEPTED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER BESIDES I MUSED ALL ROADS LEAD HOME TO EUROPE AND OUR UNICORN MAY BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE ME TOWARD THE COAST OF FRANCE THAT FINE ANIMAL MAY EVEN LET ITSELF BE CAPTURED IN EUROPEAN SEAS AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME
2764-36617-0004_6367-65536-0051 CONSEIL I CALLED IN AN IMPATIENT VOICE CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT A DEVOTED LAD WHO WENT WITH ME ON ALL MY JOURNEYS A GALLANT FLEMISH BOY WHOM I GENUINELY LIKED AND WHO RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT A BORN STOIC PUNCTILIOUS ON PRINCIPLE
2764-36617-0007_1841-150351-0004 UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2764-36617-0008_19-227-0049 WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
2764-36617-0011_669-129074-0012 THE LAD WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND HIS AGE TO THAT OF HIS EMPLOYER WAS AS FIFTEEN IS TO TWENTY PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING I HAD TURNED FORTY BUT CONSEIL HAD ONE FLAW HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY
2764-36617-0012_6019-3185-0106 AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME CONSEIL I REPEATED WHILE FEVERISHLY BEGINNING MY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE TO BE SURE I HAD CONFIDENCE IN THIS DEVOTED LAD
2764-36617-0015_211-122442-0000 YES MY BOY GET MY THINGS READY GET YOURS READY WE'RE DEPARTING IN TWO HOURS AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY WE HAVEN'T A MOMENT TO LOSE PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS
2764-36617-0016_6272-70171-0021 DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY WHAT ABOUT MASTER'S COLLECTIONS CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHAT THE ARCHAEOTHERIUM HYRACOTHERIUM OREODONTS CHEIROPOTAMUS AND MASTER'S OTHER FOSSIL SKELETONS
2764-36617-0018_7148-82991-0017 AS MASTER THINKS BEST CONSEIL REPLIED PLACIDLY YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE WE'RE GOING TO RID THE SEAS OF IT THE AUTHOR OF A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ON THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
2764-36617-0019_8797-294123-0042 IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
2764-36617-0020_87-121553-0076 THESE BEASTS CAN BE QUITE UNPREDICTABLE BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S GAME FOR ANYTHING WHAT MASTER DOES I'LL DO CONSEIL REPLIED
2764-36617-0021_2436-2477-0015 AS MASTER WISHES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER OUR TRUNKS WERE READY CONSEIL DID THEM IN A FLASH AND I WAS SURE THE LAD HADN'T MISSED A THING BECAUSE HE CLASSIFIED SHIRTS AND SUITS AS EXPERTLY AS BIRDS AND MAMMALS
2764-36617-0022_4441-76250-0010 THE HOTEL ELEVATOR DROPPED US OFF IN THE MAIN VESTIBULE ON THE MEZZANINE I WENT DOWN A SHORT STAIR LEADING TO THE GROUND FLOOR
2764-36617-0023_7794-295947-0039 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
2764-36617-0026_3607-135982-0014 I RUSHED ABOARD I ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME PROFESSOR PIERRE ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME
2764-36617-0027_4195-17507-0043 THE SAME I REPLIED COMMANDER FARRAGUT IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU I BOWED AND LETTING THE COMMANDER ATTEND TO GETTING UNDER WAY I WAS TAKEN TO THE CABIN THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR ME
2764-36617-0030_3112-9555-0072 JUST THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS GIVING ORDERS TO CAST OFF THE LAST MOORINGS HOLDING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO ITS BROOKLYN PIER AND SO IF I'D BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS
2764-36617-0034_669-129074-0015 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
2764-36617-0035_4160-11549-0023 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
2764-36617-0036_6925-80680-0060 THE WONDERFUL RIGHT BANK OF THIS RIVER ALL LOADED DOWN WITH COUNTRY HOMES AND PASSED BY THE FORTS TO SALUTES FROM THEIR BIGGEST CANNONS
2764-36619-0001_4813-248638-0007 OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH THE FRIGATE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A FLEET OF AMERICAN WHALERS AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY HADN'T SEEN THE NARWHALE BUT ONE OF THEM THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONROE
2764-36619-0003_4214-7146-0069 ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED BY JULY THIRD WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
2764-36619-0006_460-172359-0045 OUR COURSE WAS SET FOR THE NORTHWEST AND THE NEXT DAY OUR FRIGATE'S PROPELLER FINALLY CHURNED THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES REPEATED THE SAILORS OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THEY OPENED AMAZINGLY WIDE EYES AND SPYGLASSES
2764-36619-0008_8123-275193-0012 I NO LONGER LEFT THE SHIP'S DECK SOMETIMES BENDING OVER THE FORECASTLE RAILINGS SOMETIMES LEANING AGAINST THE STERNRAIL
2764-36619-0010_4297-13009-0065 WITH PANTING CHESTS AND ANXIOUS EYES WE EACH WOULD OBSERVE THE CETACEAN'S MOVEMENTS I STARED I STARED UNTIL I NEARLY WENT BLIND FROM A WORN OUT RETINA WHILE CONSEIL AS STOIC AS EVER KEPT REPEATING TO ME IN A CALM TONE
2764-36619-0013_2391-145015-0023 BECAUSE JULY IN THIS ZONE CORRESPONDS TO OUR JANUARY IN EUROPE BUT THE SEA REMAINED SMOOTH AND EASILY VISIBLE OVER A VAST PERIMETER NED LAND STILL KEPT UP THE MOST TENACIOUS SKEPTICISM
2764-36619-0014_839-130898-0058 BUT THIS STUBBORN CANADIAN SPENT EIGHT HOURS OUT OF EVERY TWELVE READING OR SLEEPING IN HIS CABIN A HUNDRED TIMES I CHIDED HIM FOR HIS UNCONCERN BAH HE REPLIED NOTHING'S OUT THERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX
2764-36619-0018_2136-5140-0004 NO DOUBT OUR BOSUN SAID BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER FOR HIM
2764-36619-0019_4813-248638-0027 THEN CUT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DEGREES AND HEADED FOR THE SEAS OF CHINA WE WERE FINALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MONSTER'S LATEST ANTICS AND IN ALL HONESTY SHIPBOARD CONDITIONS BECAME LIFE THREATENING HEARTS WERE POUNDING HIDEOUSLY
2764-36619-0020_211-122425-0005 NOBODY ATE NOBODY SLEPT TWENTY TIMES A DAY SOME ERROR IN PERCEPTION OR THE OPTICAL ILLUSIONS OF SOME SAILOR PERCHED IN THE CROSSTREES WOULD CAUSE INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND THIS EMOTION REPEATED TWENTY TIMES OVER
2764-36619-0021_5390-30102-0008 KEPT US IN A STATE OF IRRITABILITY SO INTENSE THAT A REACTION WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW AND THIS REACTION WASN'T LONG IN COMING FOR THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH EACH DAY SEEMED LIKE A CENTURY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PLOWED ALL THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC
2764-36619-0023_7264-92316-0020 AND IT DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT UNEXPLORED FROM THE BEACHES OF JAPAN TO THE COASTS OF AMERICA AND WE FOUND NOTHING NOTHING EXCEPT AN IMMENSENESS OF DESERTED WAVES NOTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A GIGANTIC NARWHALE OR AN UNDERWATER ISLET
2764-36619-0025_4481-17499-0035 THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
2764-36619-0026_6818-68772-0048 NEVER HAD THE CREW OF AN AMERICAN NAVAL CRAFT SHOWN MORE PATIENCE AND ZEAL

2817-142380-0001_1898-145724-0013 THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0004_1263-139804-0023 LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR

2817-142380-0018_7278-91083-0018 ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019_3242-8112-0029 BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0020_839-130898-0046 SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE

2817-142380-0022_7226-86964-0055 IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0023_8123-275193-0016 THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
2817-142380-0025_3699-175950-0017 YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT

2817-142380-0032_4018-107312-0018 I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
2817-142380-0036_163-122947-0096 WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE

2836-5355-0051_7780-274562-0062 BUT THAT SHE SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE GONE AWAY FROM IT WALKING IN THE FLOWER GARDEN WITH MISTER CARLYLE WHILE THE THREE CHILDREN PLAYED ON THE LAWN HER ARM WAS WITHIN HER HUSBAND'S AND HE WAS RELATING SOMETHING TO HER WHAT THE NEWS WAS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER AFTERWARD
2836-5355-0052_2007-149877-0037 EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
2836-5355-0053_911-128684-0053 ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
2843-152918-0000_6848-76049-0027 THEY HAD UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE CHANGE SINCE OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP THEY NOW WANDERED ABOUT FAT SLEEK AND CONTENTED AND THEIR FORMER VORACITY HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
2843-152918-0002_311-124404-0114 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0003_233-155990-0002 AND ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CUTLETS THE DOGS STOOD IN A RING ROUND HIM AND LOOKED ON WITH INTEREST THE NORTH EAST WIND WHISTLED AND HOWLED THE AIR WAS THICK WITH DRIVING SNOW AND WISTING WAS NOT TO BE ENVIED
2843-152918-0004_3947-13260-0030 TO WHATEVER AGE I MAY LIVE IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE WIND HAD GONE BACK TO THE NORTH AND INCREASED TO A GALE IT WAS BLOWING AND SNOWING SO THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE MORNING WE COULD NOT SEE THE SLEDGES THEY WERE HALF SNOWED UNDER
2843-152918-0006_3526-176653-0003 WE HAD ALL TAKEN A TURN OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND WERE SITTING ON OUR SLEEPING BAGS DISCUSSING THE POOR PROSPECT IT'S THE DEVIL'S OWN WEATHER HERE AT THE BUTCHER'S SAID ONE IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET ANY BETTER
2843-152918-0007_7302-86815-0070 THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY AND IT'S BLOWING WORSE THAN EVER WE ALL AGREED THERE'S NOTHING SO BAD AS LYING WEATHER BOUND LIKE THIS CONTINUED ANOTHER IT TAKES MORE OUT OF YOU THAN GOING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT PERSONALLY I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
2843-152918-0010_458-126305-0006 IT IS THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING THAT COMES FIRST TO MY MIND ALL THE QUALITIES THAT I MOST ADMIRE IN A MAN WERE CLEARLY SHOWN AT THAT JUNCTURE COURAGE AND DAUNTLESSNESS WITHOUT BOASTING OR BIG WORDS
2843-152918-0012_4813-248641-0018 THE DOGS WERE NOT MUCH INCLINED TO START AND IT TOOK TIME TO GET THEM INTO THEIR HARNESS BUT AT LAST WE WERE READY ONE MORE GLANCE OVER THE CAMPING GROUND TO SEE THAT NOTHING WE OUGHT TO HAVE WITH US HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN
2843-152918-0013_200-124139-0013 WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
2843-152918-0014_7800-283478-0010 THAT IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT THE FUTURE WILL SHOW AND THEN WE WERE OFF IT WAS A HARD PULL TO BEGIN WITH BOTH FOR MEN AND BEASTS AS THE HIGH SASTRUGI CONTINUED TOWARDS THE SOUTH
2843-152918-0017_5778-54535-0039 IT WAS LIKE DRAGGING ONESELF THROUGH SAND MEANWHILE THE SASTRUGI GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND FINALLY THEY DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE SURFACE BECAME QUITE FLAT THE GOING ALSO IMPROVED BY DEGREES
2843-152918-0018_6454-93938-0026 FOR WHAT REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AS THE STORM CONTINUED UNABATED AND THE DRIFT NOW COMBINED WITH FALLING SNOW WAS THICKER THAN EVER IT WAS ALL THE DRIVER COULD DO TO SEE HIS OWN DOGS THE SURFACE
2843-152918-0020_8324-286682-0002 BUT IT ALONE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE THIS TENDENCY OF THE GROUND TO FALL AWAY IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AFTER REACHING THE HEIGHT AT WHICH WE WERE A SLIGHT SLOPE UPWARD
2843-152918-0021_2817-142371-0062 POSSIBLY BUT DOWN NO THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY RECKONING SO FAR THE INCLINE HAD NOT BEEN SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE UNEASINESS BUT IF IT SERIOUSLY BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL WE SHOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CAMP
2843-152918-0023_3699-19401-0022 AND THE RAPID PACE AFTERWARDS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AS FAST THE DOGS COULD PULL I WAS THEREFORE FOLLOWING BY THE SIDE OF WISTING'S SLEDGE AND CHATTING WITH HIM SUDDENLY I SAW HANSSEN'S DOGS SHOOT AHEAD
2843-152918-0024_4018-107338-0000 AND DOWNHILL THEY WENT AT THE WILDEST PACE WISTING AFTER THEM I SHOUTED TO HANSSEN TO STOP
2843-152918-0025_3259-158083-0069 BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
2843-152918-0026_2910-131096-0063 WE TRAMPLED DOWN A PLACE FOR THE TENT IN THE LOOSE SNOW AND SOON GOT IT UP IT WAS NOT A LONG DAY'S MARCH THAT WE HAD DONE ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES BUT WE HAD PUT AN END TO OUR STAY AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND THAT WAS A GREAT THING
2843-152918-0027_211-122442-0045 THE BOILING POINT TEST THAT EVENING SHOWED THAT WE WERE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THAT WE HAD THUS GONE DOWN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FEET FROM THE BUTCHER'S WE TURNED IN AND WENT TO SLEEP AS SOON AS IT BRIGHTENED
2843-152918-0030_1088-129236-0016 THE SUN SHOWED AS YET LIKE A PAT OF BUTTER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE THICK MISTS THE WIND HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT BUT WAS STILL FAIRLY STRONG THIS IS AFTER ALL THE WORST PART OF ONE'S JOB
2843-152918-0032_3983-5331-0040 THE GLEAM CAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH WE LAY ON THE SIDE OF A RIDGE THAT FELL AWAY PRETTY STEEPLY THE DESCENT ON THE SOUTH WAS TOO ABRUPT BUT ON THE SOUTH EAST IT WAS BETTER AND MORE GRADUAL
2843-152918-0035_2182-181183-0035 SINCE WE HAD DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS IF WE ONCE GOT DOWN TO THE PLAIN WE KNEW THAT WE COULD ALWAYS FEEL OUR WAY ON AFTER PUTTING AMPLE BRAKES ON THE SLEDGE RUNNERS
2843-152918-0036_3947-13262-0003 WE STARTED OFF DOWNHILL IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION THE SLIGHT IDEA OF THE POSITION THAT WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE MORNING PROVED CORRECT THE DESCENT WAS EASY AND SMOOTH AND WE REACHED THE PLAIN WITHOUT ANY ADVENTURE
2843-152918-0040_307-127539-0009 WHICH WAS REAL TORTURE TO ALL OF US A SLEDGE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SAHARA COULD NOT HAVE OFFERED A WORSE SURFACE TO MOVE OVER
2843-152918-0044_150-132655-0020 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0045_1363-135842-0017 BUT WHAT ACCORDING TO DEAD RECKONING OUR LATITUDE THAT EVENING
2843-152918-0046_5652-39938-0062 THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH SHARP GUSTS FROM THE NORTH THE MORNING CAME WITH A SLACK WIND BUT ACCOMPANIED BY MIST AND SNOWFALL THIS WAS ABOMINABLE HERE WE WERE ADVANCING OVER ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN GROUND AND ABLE TO SEE NOTHING
2843-152918-0048_1963-142393-0035 LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
2843-152918-0049_2952-407-0020 AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
2843-152918-0050_405-130894-0060 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
2843-152918-0052_4160-11549-0019 TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
2843-152918-0055_5390-30096-0033 WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE IN THE CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF FINDING SOME SURPRISE OR OTHER IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE THE AIR AHEAD OF US WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH AS THOUGH IT CONCEALED SOMETHING
2843-152918-0057_2391-145015-0056 DOES NOT BEGIN VERY PROMISINGLY FOG FOG AND AGAIN FOG ALSO FINE FALLING SNOW WHICH MAKES THE GOING IMPOSSIBLE POOR BEASTS THEY HAVE TOILED HARD TO GET THE SLEDGES FORWARD TO DAY
2843-152918-0066_5456-62014-0013 AS HARD AS GLASS IN A SHORT TIME AN IMMENSE ERECTION OF ADAMANTINE BLOCKS OF SNOW ROSE INTO THE AIR CONTAINING PROVISIONS FOR FIVE MEN FOR SIX DAYS AND FOR EIGHTEEN DOGS FOR FIVE DAYS
2843-152918-0067_4195-186237-0006 A NUMBER OF SMALL ARTICLES WERE ALSO LEFT BEHIND WHILE WE WERE THUS OCCUPIED THE FOG HAD BEEN COMING AND GOING SOME OF THE INTERVALS HAD BEEN QUITE CLEAR AND HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE NEAREST PART OF THE RANGE
2843-152918-0069_6848-76049-0007 AND OLAV BJAALAND LAY CLOSER TOGETHER BEHIND THIS GROUP THE AIR HAD BEEN HEAVY AND BLACK THE WHOLE TIME SHOWING THAT MORE LAND MUST BE CONCEALED THERE SUDDENLY
2843-152918-0070_87-121553-0030 AND THE SUMMITS OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN MASS APPEARED OUR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN MUST BE SOMETHING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH IT POSITIVELY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
2843-152918-0071_4018-103416-0017 SO FORMIDABLE DID IT APPEAR BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THAT WE HAD AND THEN THE FOG ENCLOSED IT ONCE MORE WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING A FEW MEAGRE BEARINGS OF THE DIFFERENT SUMMITS OF THE NEAREST GROUP
2843-152918-0074_27-124992-0008 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0075_6836-76549-0013 THIS DID NOT AGREE VERY WELL WITH THE LATITUDE OF OUR DEAD RECKONING
2843-152918-0083_2911-12359-0025 AND A LIGHTNING LIKE MOVEMENT SOME WOULD CALL IT LUCK HE MANAGED TO SAVE HIMSELF IN THIS WAY WE WORKED UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET BUT THEN WE CAME UPON SUCH A LABYRINTH OF YAWNING CHASMS AND OPEN ABYSSES
2843-152918-0084_2989-138028-0000 THAT WE COULD NOT MOVE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO FIND THE LEAST DISTURBED SPOT AND SET THE TENT THERE AS SOON AS THIS WAS DONE HANSSEN AND I SET OUT TO EXPLORE WE WERE ROPED AND THEREFORE SAFE ENOUGH
2843-152918-0086_2196-170379-0032 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND EVOKED A PICTURE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION THANK GOD WE WERE NOT HERE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THIS BATTLEFIELD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECTACLE LIKE DOOMSDAY
2843-152918-0087_5778-12761-0021 AND NOT ON A SMALL SCALE EITHER TO ADVANCE IN THAT DIRECTION THEN WAS HOPELESS BUT THAT WAS NO GREAT MATTER SINCE OUR WAY WAS TO THE SOUTH ON THE SOUTH WE COULD SEE NOTHING THE FOG LAY THICK AND HEAVY THERE
2843-152918-0088_328-129766-0094 THIS RIDGE LED US ON TO AN ICEWAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH A FORMATION WHICH WAS DUE TO THE PRESSURE HAVING CEASED BEFORE THE WAVE HAD BEEN FORCED TO BREAK AND FORM HUMMOCKS
2843-152918-0089_4859-29340-0039 WE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT PLACE TO PASS WITH SLEDGES AND DOGS BUT IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING BETTER IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE FROM THE TOP OF THIS WAVE FORMATION WE COULD SEE DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
2843-152918-0092_4859-29340-0030 A FISSURE HAD OPENED MAKING A GATEWAY ABOUT SIX FEET WIDE THIS FORMATION LIKE EVERY THING ELSE ON THE GLACIER WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY OLD AND FOR THE MOST PART FILLED WITH SNOW
2843-152918-0093_2989-138028-0023 FROM THIS POINT THE GLACIER AS FAR AS OUR VIEW EXTENDED TO THE SOUTH LOOKED BETTER AND BETTER
2843-152918-0094_298-126791-0050 OUR COMPANIONS WERE NO LESS PLEASED WITH THE NEWS WE BROUGHT OF OUR PROSPECTS OUR ALTITUDE THAT EVENING WAS EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THAT IS TO SAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0101_2196-174172-0042 AND ALLOWED US A VERY GOOD SURVEY OF OUR POSITION WE COULD NOW SEE THAT THE TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES
2843-152918-0105_5703-47212-0003 WE WERE AT HELL'S GATE BJAALAND TOOK AN EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPH HERE WHICH GIVES A VERY GOOD IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY PRESENTED IN THE FOREGROUND
2843-152918-0106_8468-286673-0013 BELOW THE HIGH SNOW RIDGE THAT FORMS ONE SIDE OF A VERY WIDE BUT PARTLY FILLED UP CREVASSE THE MARKS OF SKI CAN BE SEEN IN THE SNOW THIS WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IN PASSING OVER THIS SNOW BRIDGE
2843-152918-0107_311-124404-0076 STRUCK HIS SKI INTO IT TO TRY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORT CLOSE TO THE TRACKS CAN BE SEEN AN OPEN PIECE OF THE CREVASSE IT IS A PALE BLUE AT THE TOP BUT ENDS IN THE DEEPEST BLACK IN A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS
2843-152918-0110_3947-13262-0050 THE ALTITUDE WAS EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THE SUN WAS NOW IN THE WEST AND SHINING DIRECTLY UPON THE HUGE MOUNTAIN MASSES IT WAS A FAIRY LANDSCAPE IN BLUE AND WHITE
2843-152918-0111_1743-142913-0024 CLEAR AS IT NOW APPEARED TO BE ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE WEATHER WAS NOT ALL THAT COULD BE WISHED FOR THE SOUTH EASTERN END OF MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN LOST ITSELF IN A DARK IMPENETRABLE CLOUD
2843-152918-0112_1970-28415-0006 WHICH LED ONE TO SUSPECT A CONTINUATION IN THAT DIRECTION THOUGH ONE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN MOUNT NILSEN AH ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL TAKING IT ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN
2843-152918-0113_3664-178355-0033 PEAKS OF THE MOST VARIED FORMS ROSE HIGH INTO THE AIR PARTLY COVERED WITH DRIVING CLOUDS SOME WERE SHARP BUT MOST WERE LONG AND ROUNDED HERE AND THERE ONE SAW BRIGHT SHINING GLACIERS
2843-152918-0114_4018-107338-0005 PLUNGING WILDLY DOWN THE STEEP SIDES AND MERGING INTO THE UNDERLYING GROUND IN FEARFUL CONFUSION BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THEM ALL WAS MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN ITS TOP WAS AS ROUND AS THE BOTTOM OF A BOWL
289-121652-0002_4680-16041-0033 AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
289-121652-0005_8770-295462-0021 THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
289-121652-0007_2952-410-0002 ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
289-121652-0012_7302-86815-0074 RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
289-121652-0013_3486-166424-0027 AMERICA BASES HER CLAIM TO MOTHER GOOSE UPON THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT MADE BY THE LATE JOHN FLEET ELIOT A DESCENDANT OF THOMAS FLEET THE PRINTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE LIVED IN BOSTON A LADY NAMED ELIZA GOOSE
289-121652-0015_8468-294887-0024 AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
289-121652-0016_909-131045-0017 TRIED WHAT RIDICULE COULD EFFECT AND ACTUALLY PRINTED A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE SONGS OF THE NURSERY OR MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE TITLE PAGE WAS THE PICTURE OF A GOOSE WITH A VERY LONG NECK AND A MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BELOW THIS
289-121652-0018_8324-286682-0004 AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
289-121652-0022_2952-408-0000 INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
289-121652-0025_4195-186236-0007 THROUGH LONG YEARS OF SERVICE AS NURSE SHE CAME TO BE CALLED MOTHER GOOCH THIS GOOD WOMAN HAD ONE PECULIARITY SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CROON QUEER RHYMES AND JINGLES OVER THE CRADLES OF HER CHARGES AND THESE RHYMES
289-121652-0029_2952-407-0000 WHICH IT IS SAID WAS PRINTED BY JOHN WORTHINGTON AND SON IN THE STRAND LONDON IN SEVENTEEN TWELVE UNDER THE NAME OF YE MELODIOUS RHYMES OF MOTHER GOOSE BUT EVEN THIS STORY OF MARTHA GOOCH
289-121652-0031_3214-167606-0015 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE NONE OF THE EARLIER EDITIONS HOWEVER CONTAINED ALL THE RHYMES SO WELL KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY SINCE EVERY DECADE HAS ADDED ITS QUOTA TO THE MASS OF JINGLES ATTRIBUTED TO MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0033_909-131041-0009 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES

2893-139322-0007_5808-48608-0012 THE BLUE CANVAS CLOTHING WAS ON MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MANY OF THESE GREAT AND DUSTY GALLERIES WERE SILENT AVENUES OF MACHINERY ENDLESS RAKED OUT ASHEN FURNACES TESTIFIED TO THE REVOLUTIONARY DISLOCATION
2893-139322-0009_328-129766-0018 THE VOLUNTARY VIGOURS OF THE BUSINESS QUARTER GRAHAM COULD NOTE THE PINCHED FACES THE FEEBLE MUSCLES AND WEARY EYES OF MANY OF THE LATTER DAY WORKERS SUCH AS HE SAW AT WORK WERE NOTICEABLY INFERIOR IN PHYSIQUE TO THE FEW GAILY DRESSED MANAGERS AND FOREWOMEN
2893-139322-0010_1553-140048-0027 WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE

2893-139322-0015_1235-135883-0040 HAD BEEN A DIVERSE MULTITUDE STILL STIRRED BY THE TRADITION OF PERSONAL HONOUR AND A HIGH MORALITY NOW IT WAS DIFFERENTIATING INTO AN INSTINCT CLASS WITH A MORAL AND PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE OF ITS OWN EVEN WITH A DIALECT OF ITS OWN
2893-139322-0016_26-495-0078 THEY PENETRATED DOWNWARD EVER DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE WORKING PLACES PRESENTLY THEY PASSED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE STREETS OF THE MOVING WAYS AND SAW ITS PLATFORMS RUNNING ON THEIR RAILS FAR OVERHEAD AND CHINKS OF WHITE LIGHTS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLITS
2893-139322-0017_7278-246956-0013 THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
2893-139322-0018_125-121342-0037 HE CAME TO THE WARREN OF THE JEWELLERS AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND BY USING HIS SIGNATURE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO THESE GALLERIES THEY WERE HIGH AND DARK AND RATHER COLD IN THE FIRST A FEW MEN WERE MAKING ORNAMENTS OF GOLD FILIGREE
2893-139322-0019_2691-156745-0031 EACH MAN AT A LITTLE BENCH BY HIMSELF AND WITH A LITTLE SHADED LIGHT THE LONG VISTA OF LIGHT PATCHES WITH THE NIMBLE FINGERS BRIGHTLY LIT AND MOVING AMONG THE GLEAMING YELLOW COILS AND THE INTENT FACE LIKE THE FACE OF A GHOST IN EACH SHADOW
2893-139322-0023_1069-133709-0040 MANY OF THESE WORKERS HAD LIPS AND NOSTRILS A LIVID WHITE DUE TO A DISEASE CAUSED BY A PECULIAR PURPLE ENAMEL THAT CHANCED TO BE MUCH IN FASHION ASANO APOLOGISED TO GRAHAM FOR THIS OFFENSIVE SIGHT BUT EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE SCORE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS ROUTE
2893-139322-0025_441-128982-0021 GRAHAM MADE SOME INDIGNANT COMMENTS BUT SIRE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT STAND THAT STUFF WITHOUT THE PURPLE SAID ASANO IN YOUR DAYS PEOPLE COULD STAND SUCH CRUDITIES THEY WERE NEARER THE BARBARIC BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS
2893-139322-0026_3259-158083-0025 AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
2893-139322-0027_7302-86815-0021 BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
2893-139322-0028_39-121914-0001 EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE WOULD STOP TO COUGH A SHADOWY HUGE MASS OF MASONRY RISING OUT OF THE INKY WATER BROUGHT TO GRAHAM'S MIND THE THOUGHT OF THE MULTITUDE OF WAYS AND GALLERIES AND LIFTS THAT ROSE FLOOR ABOVE FLOOR OVERHEAD BETWEEN HIM AND THE SKY
2893-139322-0032_1624-142933-0039 THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0033_2436-2481-0012 THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
2893-139322-0034_289-121652-0019 AND HERE UNPRECEDENTED REEKS EVERYWHERE WERE PILLARS AND CROSS ARCHINGS OF SUCH A MASSIVENESS AS GRAHAM HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THICK TITANS OF GREASY SHINING BRICKWORK CRUSHED BENEATH THE VAST WEIGHT OF THAT COMPLEX CITY WORLD
2893-139322-0035_332-128985-0033 EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
2893-139322-0036_3168-173565-0044 GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
2893-139322-0038_201-127786-0011 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS REMNANT THAT WORKED WORKED HOPELESSLY ALL THE SPIRIT THAT WAS LEFT IN FALLEN HUMANITY WAS ABOVE IN THE STREETS THAT NIGHT CALLING FOR THE MASTER AND VALIANTLY AND NOISILY KEEPING ITS ARMS
2893-139322-0039_6563-63821-0023 THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES

2911-15045-0022_103-1241-0033 AND AS THE VOYAGER PASSED SOME WOODED POINT OR THICKET COVERED ISLAND THE WHISTLING OF A STONE HEADED ARROW PROCLAIMED PERHAPS THE PRESENCE OF THESE FIERCE MARAUDERS AT MONTREAL THERE WAS NO HUMAN LIFE SAVE DURING A BRIEF SPACE IN EARLY SUMMER
2911-15045-0023_3240-131232-0007 WHEN THE SHORE SWARMED WITH SAVAGES WHO HAD COME TO THE YEARLY TRADE FROM THE GREAT COMMUNITIES OF THE INTERIOR
2911-15045-0024_3259-158083-0077 TO MORROW ALL AGAIN WAS SOLITUDE AND THE OTTAWA WAS COVERED WITH THE CANOES OF THE RETURNING WARRIORS ALONG THIS STREAM A MAIN ROUTE OF TRAFFIC THE SILENCE OF THE WILDERNESS WAS BROKEN ONLY BY THE SPLASH OF THE PASSING PADDLE
2911-15045-0025_39-121914-0023 TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER THERE WAS INDEED A SMALL ALGONQUIN BAND CALLED LA PETITE NATION TOGETHER WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER FEEBLE COMMUNITIES BUT THEY DWELT FAR FROM THE BANKS THROUGH FEAR OF THE UBIQUITOUS IROQUOIS
2911-15045-0026_696-92939-0027 IT WAS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES BY THE WINDINGS OF THE STREAM BEFORE ONE REACHED THAT ALGONQUIN TRIBE
2911-15045-0027_7226-86964-0048 THEN AFTER MANY A DAY OF LONELY TRAVEL THE VOYAGER FOUND A SAVAGE WELCOME AMONG THE NIPISSINGS ON THE LAKE WHICH BEARS THEIR NAME AND THEN CIRCLING WEST AND SOUTH FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF SOLITUDE

2911-15084-0000_1355-39947-0042 WOULD HAVE FORMED HIS CHRISTIAN EMPIRE IN THE WILDERNESS BUT ONE BY ONE THESE KINDRED PEOPLES WERE UPROOTED AND SWEPT AWAY WHILE THE NEIGHBORING ALGONQUINS TO WHOM THEY HAD BEEN A BULWARK WERE INVOLVED WITH THEM IN A COMMON RUIN
2911-15084-0003_7780-274562-0084 THE GUNS AND TOMAHAWKS OF THE IROQUOIS WERE THE RUIN OF THEIR HOPES COULD THEY HAVE CURBED OR CONVERTED THOSE FEROCIOUS BANDS IT IS LITTLE LESS THAN CERTAIN
2911-15084-0005_8095-274345-0007 UNMOLESTED BY INDIAN ENEMIES AND FED BY A RICH COMMERCE SHE WOULD HAVE PUT FORTH A VIGOROUS GROWTH TRUE TO HER FAR REACHING AND ADVENTUROUS GENIUS SHE WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED THE WEST WITH TRADERS SETTLERS AND GARRISONS

2911-15084-0010_1081-125237-0046 POPULATIONS FORMED IN THE IDEAS AND HABITS OF A FEUDAL MONARCHY AND CONTROLLED BY A HIERARCHY PROFOUNDLY HOSTILE TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE REMAINED A HINDRANCE AND A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF THAT MAJESTIC EXPERIMENT
2911-15084-0011_8630-305212-0003 OF WHICH AMERICA IS THE FIELD THE JESUITS SAW THEIR HOPES STRUCK DOWN AND THEIR FAITH THOUGH NOT SHAKEN WAS SORELY TRIED THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD SEEMED IN THEIR EYES DARK AND INEXPLICABLE BUT FROM THE STAND POINT OF LIBERTY
2911-15084-0012_8098-275181-0012 THAT PROVIDENCE IS CLEAR AS THE SUN AT NOON MEANWHILE LET THOSE WHO HAVE PREVAILED YIELD DUE HONOR TO THE DEFEATED THEIR VIRTUES SHINE AMIDST THE RUBBISH OF ERROR LIKE DIAMONDS AND GOLD IN THE GRAVEL OF THE TORRENT

2911-7601-0005_2817-142380-0007 I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN AND THUS RID MYSELF OF THE EYE FOREVER NOW THIS IS THE POINT YOU FANCY ME MAD MADMEN KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WISELY I PROCEEDED
2911-7601-0007_8975-270782-0034 OH SO GENTLY AND THEN WHEN I HAD MADE AN OPENING SUFFICIENT FOR MY HEAD I PUT IN A DARK LANTERN ALL CLOSED CLOSED THAT NO LIGHT SHONE OUT AND THEN I THRUST IN MY HEAD
2911-7601-0011_6000-55211-0012 SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
2911-7601-0012_6078-54007-0017 NEVER BEFORE THAT NIGHT HAD I FELT THE EXTENT OF MY OWN POWERS OF MY SAGACITY I COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN MY FEELINGS OF TRIUMPH TO THINK THAT THERE I WAS OPENING THE DOOR LITTLE BY LITTLE
2911-7601-0014_8238-274553-0070 HIS ROOM WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH WITH THE THICK DARKNESS FOR THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSE FASTENED THROUGH FEAR OF ROBBERS AND SO I KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OPENING OF THE DOOR
2911-7601-0016_6078-54013-0056 FOR A WHOLE HOUR I DID NOT MOVE A MUSCLE AND IN THE MEANTIME I DID NOT HEAR HIM LIE DOWN HE WAS STILL SITTING UP IN THE BED LISTENING JUST AS I HAVE DONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HEARKENING TO THE DEATH WATCHES IN THE WALL
2911-7601-0021_8425-246962-0008 IT IS ONLY A MOUSE CROSSING THE FLOOR OR IT IS MERELY A CRICKET WHICH HAS MADE A SINGLE CHIRP YES HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THESE SUPPOSITIONS BUT HE HAD FOUND ALL IN VAIN ALL IN VAIN BECAUSE DEATH
2911-7601-0022_1069-133699-0038 IN APPROACHING HIM HAD STALKED WITH HIS BLACK SHADOW BEFORE HIM AND ENVELOPED THE VICTIM AND IT WAS THE MOURNFUL INFLUENCE OF THE UNPERCEIVED SHADOW THAT CAUSED HIM TO FEEL ALTHOUGH HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD TO FEEL THE PRESENCE OF MY HEAD WITHIN THE ROOM
2911-7601-0024_1447-130552-0018 STEALTHILY UNTIL AT LENGTH A SIMPLE DIM RAY LIKE THE THREAD OF THE SPIDER
2911-7601-0025_1334-135589-0081 AND FELL FULL UPON THE VULTURE EYE IT WAS OPEN WIDE WIDE OPEN AND I GREW FURIOUS AS I GAZED UPON IT I SAW IT WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS ALL A DULL BLUE
2911-7601-0026_8312-279791-0032 WITH A HIDEOUS VEIL OVER IT THAT CHILLED THE VERY MARROW IN MY BONES BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE OF THE OLD MAN'S FACE OR PERSON FOR I HAD DIRECTED THE RAY AS IF BY INSTINCT PRECISELY UPON THE DAMNED SPOT
2911-7601-0027_2002-139469-0024 AND HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT WHAT YOU MISTAKE FOR MADNESS IS BUT OVER ACUTENESS OF THE SENSE NOW I SAY THERE CAME TO MY EARS
2911-7601-0032_887-123290-0021 YET FOR SOME MINUTES LONGER I REFRAINED AND STOOD STILL BUT THE BEATING GREW LOUDER LOUDER I THOUGHT THE HEART MUST BURST AND NOW A NEW ANXIETY SEIZED ME THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR THE OLD MAN'S HOUR HAD COME
2911-7601-0033_2952-410-0000 WITH A LOUD YELL I THREW OPEN THE LANTERN AND LEAPED INTO THE ROOM HE SHRIEKED ONCE ONCE ONLY IN AN INSTANT I DRAGGED HIM TO THE FLOOR
2911-7601-0035_3879-174923-0037 I REMOVED THE BED AND EXAMINED THE CORPSE YES HE WAS STONE STONE DEAD I PLACED MY HAND UPON THE HEART AND HELD IT THERE MANY MINUTES THERE WAS NO PULSATION HE WAS STONE DEAD HIS EYE WOULD TROUBLE ME NO MORE
2911-7601-0040_1081-125237-0086 WITH PERFECT SUAVITY AS OFFICERS OF THE POLICE A SHRIEK HAD BEEN HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR DURING THE NIGHT SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY HAD BEEN AROUSED INFORMATION HAD BEEN LODGED AT THE POLICE OFFICE AND THEY THE OFFICERS

2911-7601-0045_5688-15787-0020 AND BECAME MORE DISTINCT I TALKED MORE FREELY TO GET RID OF THE FEELING BUT IT CONTINUED AND GAINED DEFINITENESS UNTIL AT LENGTH I FOUND THAT THE NOISE WAS NOT WITHIN MY EARS NO DOUBT I NOW GREW VERY PALE BUT I TALKED MORE FLUENTLY
2911-7601-0046_6415-116629-0029 AND WITH A HEIGHTENED VOICE YET THE SOUND INCREASED AND WHAT COULD I DO IT WAS A LOW DULL QUICK SOUND MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I GASPED FOR BREATH AND YET THE OFFICERS HEARD IT NOT
2911-7601-0050_307-127535-0022 WAS IT POSSIBLE THEY HEARD NOT ALMIGHTY GOD NO NO THEY HEARD THEY SUSPECTED THEY KNEW THEY WERE MAKING A MOCKERY OF MY HORROR THIS I THOUGHT AND THIS I THINK
2911-7601-0051_229-130880-0086 BUT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THIS AGONY ANYTHING WAS MORE TOLERABLE THAN THIS DERISION I COULD BEAR THOSE HYPOCRITICAL SMILES NO LONGER I FELT THAT I MUST SCREAM OR DIE AND NOW AGAIN HARK LOUDER LOUDER
2952-407-0001_7278-91083-0024 WHO PRESENTED HER MIRROR TO THE TEMPLE TO BE USED FOR BELL METAL BUT AFTERWARDS SHE MUCH REGRETTED HER MIRROR SHE REMEMBERED THINGS THAT HER MOTHER HAD TOLD HER ABOUT IT AND SHE REMEMBERED THAT IT HAD BELONGED NOT ONLY TO HER MOTHER BUT TO HER MOTHER'S MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND SHE REMEMBERED SOME HAPPY SMILES WHICH IT HAD REFLECTED
2952-407-0002_4088-158079-0017 BUT SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY NECESSARY WHENEVER SHE WENT TO THE TEMPLE SHE SAW HER MIRROR LYING IN THE COURT YARD BEHIND A RAILING AMONG HUNDREDS OF OTHER MIRRORS HEAPED THERE TOGETHER SHE KNEW IT BY THE SHO CHIKU BAI IN RELIEF ON THE BACK OF IT THOSE THREE FORTUNATE EMBLEMS OF PINE BAMBOO AND PLUMFLOWER
2952-407-0003_5322-7680-0023 WHICH DELIGHTED HER BABY EYES WHEN HER MOTHER FIRST SHOWED HER THE MIRROR SHE LONGED FOR SOME CHANCE TO STEAL THE MIRROR AND HIDE IT THAT SHE MIGHT THEREAFTER TREASURE IT ALWAYS BUT THE CHANCE DID NOT COME AND SHE BECAME VERY UNHAPPY FELT AS IF SHE HAD FOOLISHLY GIVEN AWAY A PART OF HER LIFE
2952-407-0006_150-126112-0012 OF COURSE EVERYBODY HEARD OF THE MATTER AND EVERYBODY SOON KNEW WHOSE MIRROR IT WAS THAT WOULD NOT MELT AND BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER SECRET FAULT THE POOR WOMAN BECAME VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND VERY ANGRY AND AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SHAME SHE DROWNED HERSELF
2952-407-0008_3259-158083-0082 BUT THE BELL PROVED TO BE A GOOD BELL AND IT BRAVELY WITHSTOOD THEIR ASSAULTS NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE WERE NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED DAY AFTER DAY AT ALL HOURS THEY CONTINUED TO RING THE BELL FURIOUSLY CARING NOTHING WHATEVER FOR THE PROTESTS OF THE PRIESTS
2952-407-0010_5867-48852-0022 OR BELL OF MUGEN NOW THERE ARE QUEER OLD JAPANESE BELIEFS IN THE MAGICAL EFFICACY OF A CERTAIN MENTAL OPERATION IMPLIED THOUGH NOT DESCRIBED BY THE VERB
2952-407-0016_403-126855-0024 FOR THE SAME REASON THAT SISTER HELEN MADE A LITTLE MAN OF WAX AND NAIL IT
2952-407-0023_87-121553-0104 AFTERWARDS A SONG WAS MADE ABOUT UMEGAE'S BASIN OF BRONZE AND THAT SONG IS SUNG BY DANCING GIRLS EVEN TO THIS DAY UMEGAE NO CHOZUBACHI TATAITE
2952-407-0026_311-124404-0037 AS IT DESERVES TO BE ANSWERED TAKE THEREFORE THIS JAR SO SAYING SHE PUT THE JAR INTO HIS HANDS AND DISAPPEARED INTO HIS HOUSE THE HAPPY MAN RUSHED TO TELL HIS WIFE THE GOOD NEWS HE SET DOWN IN FRONT OF HER THE COVERED JAR WHICH WAS HEAVY
2952-407-0027_89-219-0016 AND THEY OPENED IT TOGETHER AND THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS FILLED UP TO THE VERY BRIM WITH
2952-408-0001_5750-100289-0037 FOR A LONG TIME HE WANDERED ABOUT HELPLESSLY AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO DESPAIR OF FINDING SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT WHEN HE PERCEIVED ON THE TOP OF A HILL LIGHTED BY THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE HERMITAGES CALLED
2952-408-0002_2436-2481-0016 WHICH ARE BUILT FOR SOLITARY PRIESTS IT SEEMED TO BE IN RUINOUS CONDITION BUT HE HASTENED TO IT EAGERLY AND FOUND THAT IT WAS INHABITED BY AN AGED PRIEST FROM WHOM HE BEGGED THE FAVOR OF A NIGHT'S LODGING
2952-408-0007_200-124139-0007 BUT I AM SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT TELL ME OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH WHEN I CAME FOR THOUGH I WAS A LITTLE TIRED I CERTAINLY WAS NOT SO TIRED THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOUND DIFFICULTY IN DOING MY DUTY AS A PRIEST HAD YOU TOLD ME I COULD HAVE PERFORMED THE SERVICE BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
2952-408-0010_8630-305213-0025 BY THE RULE OF OUR VILLAGE NONE OF US CAN STAY HERE AFTER MIDNIGHT WE BEG KIND SIR THAT YOU WILL TAKE EVERY CARE OF YOUR HONORABLE BODY WHILE WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND UPON YOU AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING STRANGE DURING OUR ABSENCE PLEASE TELL US OF THE MATTER WHEN WE RETURN IN THE MORNING
2952-408-0014_8226-274371-0053 HE SAW THAT SHAPE LIFT THE CORPSE AS WITH HANDS DEVOUR IT MORE QUICKLY THAN A CAT DEVOURS A RAT BEGINNING AT THE HEAD AND EATING EVERYTHING THE HAIR AND THE BONES AND EVEN THE SHROUD AND THE MONSTROUS THING HAVING THUS CONSUMED THE BODY
2952-408-0015_328-129766-0011 TURNED TO THE OFFERINGS AND ATE THEM ALSO THEN IT WENT AWAY AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS IT HAD COME WHEN THE VILLAGERS RETURNED NEXT MORNING THEY FOUND THE PRIEST AWAITING THEM AT THE DOOR OF THE HEADMAN'S DWELLING ALL IN TURN SALUTED HIM AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED
2952-408-0016_8838-298545-0004 AND LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM NO ONE EXPRESSED ANY SURPRISE AT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DEAD BODY AND THE OFFERINGS BUT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID TO MUSO REVERENT SIR YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN UNPLEASANT THINGS DURING THE NIGHT
2952-408-0017_374-180298-0000 ALL OF US WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU BUT NOW WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO FIND YOU ALIVE AND UNHARMED GLADLY WE WOULD HAVE STAYED WITH YOU IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE BUT THE LAW OF OUR VILLAGE AS I TOLD YOU LAST EVENING OBLIGES US TO QUIT OUR HOUSES AFTER A DEATH HAS TAKEN PLACE
2952-408-0019_211-122425-0058 THEN MUSO TOLD OF THE DIM AND AWFUL SHAPE THAT HAD ENTERED THE DEATH CHAMBER TO DEVOUR THE BODY AND THE OFFERINGS NO PERSON SEEMED TO BE SURPRISED BY HIS NARRATION AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OBSERVED
2952-408-0020_198-126831-0040 WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US REVEREND SIR AGREES WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS MATTER FROM ANCIENT TIME MUSO THEN INQUIRED DOES NOT THE PRIEST ON THE HILL SOMETIMES PERFORM THE FUNERAL SERVICE FOR YOUR DEAD WHAT PRIEST THE YOUNG MAN ASKED
2952-408-0023_4813-248638-0013 FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS KIND HOSTS SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE BEEN DELUDED BY SOME GOBLIN BUT AFTER HAVING BIDDEN THEM FAREWELL AND OBTAINED ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION AS TO HIS ROAD HE DETERMINED TO LOOK AGAIN FOR THE HERMITAGE ON THE HILL AND SO TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE HAD REALLY BEEN DECEIVED
2952-408-0024_8063-274117-0009 AND THIS TIME ITS AGED OCCUPANT INVITED HIM TO ENTER WHEN HE HAD DONE SO THE HERMIT HUMBLY BOWED DOWN BEFORE HIM EXCLAIMING AH I AM ASHAMED I AM VERY MUCH ASHAMED I AM EXCEEDINGLY ASHAMED
2952-408-0025_8838-298546-0047 YOU NEED NOT BE ASHAMED FOR HAVING REFUSED ME SHELTER SAID MUSO YOU DIRECTED ME TO THE VILLAGE YONDER WHERE I WAS VERY KINDLY TREATED AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT FAVOR I CAN GIVE NO MAN SHELTER THE RECLUSE MADE ANSWER
2952-408-0026_1926-143879-0004 SO IN THAT TIME THE BODIES OF THE MOUNTAIN FOLK WHO DIED USED TO BE BROUGHT HERE SOMETIMES FROM GREAT DISTANCES IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT REPEAT OVER THEM THE HOLY SERVICE BUT I REPEATED THE SERVICE AND PERFORMED THE RITES ONLY AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS
2952-408-0027_6848-76049-0005 I THOUGHT ONLY OF THE FOOD AND THE CLOTHES THAT MY SACRED PROFESSION ENABLED ME TO GAIN AND BECAUSE OF THIS SELFISH IMPIETY I WAS REBORN IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY DEATH INTO THE STATE OF A JIKININKI
2952-408-0028_3436-172171-0015 SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO FEED UPON THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIE IN THIS DISTRICT EVERY ONE OF THEM I MUST DEVOUR IN THE WAY THAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT NOW REVEREND SIR
2952-410-0004_1970-26100-0036 HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
2952-410-0006_78-368-0032 AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENT OBSERVATION SAID TO HIM IN A TONE OF GREAT SURPRISE WHAT KIND OF A MAN CAN YOU BE GOOD SIR THAT YOU DARE TO LIE DOWN ALONE IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THERE ARE HAUNTERS ABOUT HERE MANY OF THEM ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF HAIRY THINGS
2952-410-0008_1116-132847-0037 AS FOR LONESOME PLACES I LIKE THEM THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR MEDITATION I AM ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AIR AND I HAVE LEARNED NEVER TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT MY LIFE
2952-410-0009_2384-152900-0086 TO LIE DOWN HERE THIS PLACE HAS A BAD NAME A VERY BAD NAME BUT AS THE PROVERB HAS IT KUNSHI AYAYUKI NI CHIKAYORAZU THE SUPERIOR MAN DOES NOT NEEDLESSLY EXPOSE HIMSELF TO PERIL
2952-410-0010_1926-147979-0041 AND I MUST ASSURE YOU SIR THAT IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SLEEP HERE THEREFORE ALTHOUGH MY HOUSE IS ONLY A WRETCHED THATCHED HUT LET ME BEG OF YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME AT ONCE IN THE WAY OF FOOD I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU BUT THERE IS A ROOF AT LEAST AND YOU CAN SLEEP UNDER IT WITHOUT RISK
2952-410-0015_332-128985-0056 THOUGH NOW LIVING AS YOU FIND ME I WAS ONCE A PERSON OF SOME DISTINCTION MY STORY IS THE STORY OF A RUINED LIFE RUINED BY MY OWN FAULT I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF A DAIMYO AND MY RANK IN THAT SERVICE WAS NOT INCONSIDERABLE
2952-410-0016_1069-133709-0051 BUT I LOVED WOMEN AND WINE TOO WELL AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION I ACTED WICKEDLY
2952-410-0017_332-128985-0067 RETRIBUTION FOLLOWED ME AND I LONG REMAINED A FUGITIVE IN THE LAND NOW I OFTEN PRAY THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME ATONEMENT FOR THE EVIL WHICH I DID AND TO REESTABLISH THE ANCESTRAL HOME BUT I FEAR THAT I SHALL NEVER FIND ANY WAY OF SO DOING
2952-410-0019_6272-70191-0019 IN THE HOLY SUTRAS IT IS WRITTEN THAT THOSE STRONGEST IN WRONG DOING CAN BECOME BY POWER OF GOOD RESOLVE THE STRONGEST IN RIGHT DOING I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART AND I HOPE THAT BETTER FORTUNE WILL COME TO YOU
2952-410-0020_200-126784-0029 TO NIGHT I SHALL RECITE THE SUTRAS FOR YOUR SAKE AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN THE FORCE TO OVERCOME THE KARMA OF ANY PAST ERRORS WITH THESE ASSURANCES KWAIRYO BADE THE ARUJI GOOD NIGHT AND HIS HOST SHOWED HIM TO A VERY SMALL SIDE ROOM WHERE A BED HAD BEEN MADE READY
2952-410-0021_3235-28452-0014 THEN ALL WENT TO SLEEP EXCEPT THE PRIEST WHO BEGAN TO READ THE SUTRAS BY THE LIGHT OF A PAPER LANTERN UNTIL A LATE HOUR HE CONTINUED TO READ AND PRAY
2952-410-0023_8609-262281-0036 AND THE SOUND OF THE NEIGHBORING CASCADE DEEPENED WITH THE NIGHT KWAIRYO FELT THIRSTY AS HE LISTENED TO THE NOISE OF THE WATER AND REMEMBERING THE BAMBOO AQUEDUCT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GO THERE AND GET A DRINK WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD
2952-410-0025_7635-105409-0042 FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOOD BEWILDERED IMAGINING A CRIME BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO BLOOD AND THAT THE HEADLESS NECKS DID NOT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0028_7635-105409-0045 GENTLY UNBARRING THE DOOR HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE GARDEN AND PROCEEDED WITH ALL POSSIBLE CAUTION TO THE GROVE BEYOND IT HE HEARD VOICES TALKING IN THE GROVE AND HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICES STEALING FROM SHADOW TO SHADOW UNTIL HE REACHED A GOOD HIDING PLACE
2952-410-0029_587-41611-0000 THEN FROM BEHIND A TRUNK HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE HEADS ALL FIVE OF THEM FLITTING ABOUT AND CHATTING AS THEY FLITTED THEY WERE EATING WORMS AND INSECTS WHICH THEY FOUND ON THE GROUND OR AMONG THE TREES
2952-410-0030_1594-135914-0053 PRESENTLY THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI STOPPED EATING AND SAID AH THAT TRAVELING PRIEST WHO CAME TO NIGHT HOW FAT ALL HIS BODY IS WHEN WE SHALL HAVE EATEN HIM OUR BELLIES WILL BE WELL FILLED I WAS FOOLISH TO TALK TO HIM AS I DID
2952-410-0031_6078-54007-0047 TO GO NEAR HIM WHILE HE IS RECITING WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND WE CANNOT TOUCH HIM SO LONG AS HE IS PRAYING BUT AS IT IS NOW NEARLY MORNING PERHAPS HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP SOME ONE OF YOU GO TO THE HOUSE AND SEE WHAT THE FELLOW IS DOING
2952-410-0032_403-128339-0006 ANOTHER HEAD THE HEAD OF A YOUNG WOMAN IMMEDIATELY ROSE UP AND FLITTED TO THE HOUSE LIGHTLY AS A BAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT CAME BACK AND CRIED OUT HUSKILY IN A TONE OF GREAT ALARM THAT TRAVELING PRIEST IS NOT IN THE HOUSE HE IS GONE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF THE MATTER
2952-410-0033_3982-178459-0000 HE HAS TAKEN THE BODY OF OUR ARUJI AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE HAS PUT IT AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI DISTINCTLY VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT ASSUMED A FRIGHTFUL ASPECT ITS EYES OPENED MONSTROUSLY ITS HAIR STOOD UP BRISTLING AND ITS TEETH GNASHED
2952-410-0035_8312-279791-0053 AND THERE HE IS BEHIND THAT TREE HIDING BEHIND THAT TREE SEE HIM THE FAT COWARD IN THE SAME MOMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER FOUR HEADS SPRANG AT KWAIRYO
2952-410-0038_6064-56168-0001 BUT ITS TEETH STILL HELD THE SLEEVE AND FOR ALL HIS GREAT STRENGTH KWAIRYO COULD NOT FORCE OPEN THE JAWS WITH THE HEAD STILL HANGING TO HIS SLEEVE HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND THERE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE OTHER FOUR ROKURO KUBI SQUATTING TOGETHER
2952-410-0040_196-122152-0016 AND KWAIRYO KNEW THAT THE POWER OF THE GOBLINS WAS LIMITED TO THE HOURS OF DARKNESS HE LOOKED AT THE HEAD CLINGING TO HIS SLEEVE ITS FACE ALL FOULED WITH BLOOD AND FOAM AND CLAY AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0042_311-124404-0041 SEIZED THE PRIEST AND TOOK HIM TO JAIL FOR THEY SUPPOSED THE HEAD TO BE THE HEAD OF A MURDERED MAN WHO IN THE MOMENT OF BEING KILLED HAD CAUGHT THE MURDERER'S SLEEVE IN HIS TEETH AS THE KWAIRYO HE ONLY SMILED AND SAID NOTHING WHEN THEY QUESTIONED HIM
2952-410-0046_7226-86965-0034 A VERY OLD MAN THIS AGED OFFICER HAD MADE NO REMARK DURING THE TRIAL BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD THE OPINION OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE ROSE UP AND SAID LET US FIRST EXAMINE THE HEAD CAREFULLY FOR THIS I THINK HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE
2952-410-0048_1116-132847-0024 ON THE CONTRARY THE LINE OF LEVERANCE WAS SMOOTH AS THE LINE AT WHICH A FALLING LEAF DETACHES ITSELF FROM THE STEM THEN SAID THE ELDER I AM QUITE SURE THAT THE PRIEST TOLD US NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THIS IS THE HEAD OF A ROKURO KUBI
2952-410-0050_3486-166424-0037 PERHAPS YOU ONCE BELONGED TO THE SAMURAI CLASS
2952-410-0051_3259-158083-0083 BEFORE BECOMING A PRIEST I LONG FOLLOWED THE PROFESSION OF ARMS AND IN THOSE DAYS I NEVER FEARED MAN OR DEVIL MY NAME THEN WAS ISOGAI HEIDAZAEMON TAKETSURA OF KYUSHU THERE MAY BE SOME AMONG YOU WHO REMEMBER IT
2952-410-0052_8088-284756-0084 AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION FILLED THE COURT ROOM FOR THERE WERE MANY PRESENT WHO REMEMBERED IT AND KWAIRYO IMMEDIATELY FOUND HIMSELF AMONG FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JUDGES FRIENDS ANXIOUS TO PROVE THEIR ADMIRATION BY FRATERNAL KINDNESS
298-126790-0002_1081-125237-0028 NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS BODY HAD RISEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH A RULE FROM WHICH HE NEVER DEPARTED OF SLEEPING BUT SIX HOURS AT A TIME THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW POINTS IN WHICH THE CARE OF THE HUMAN FRAME WAS INVOLVED ON WHICH THE TROOPER AND THE SURGEON OF HORSE WERE EVER KNOWN TO AGREE
298-126790-0003_4267-78186-0030 THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
298-126790-0005_26-495-0044 STARTLED THE PRUDENT SURGEON AND WARNED HIM OF A TRITE SAYING IN THE CORPS THAT CAPTAIN LAWTON ALWAYS SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN THIS GROUP HAD ASSEMBLED IN ONE OF THE PARLORS AS THE SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE OVER THE EASTERN HILL DISPERSING THE COLUMNS OF FOG WHICH HAD ENVELOPED THE LOWLAND
298-126790-0006_403-216-0002 MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
298-126790-0007_8425-246962-0000 AND WAS SEEN MAKING HASTY STEPS TOWARDS THE LOCUSTS THERE WAS THAT IN THE AIR OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WHICH BESPOKE DISTRESS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE AND THE KIND HEARTED MISTRESS OF THE LOCUSTS OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF SOOTHING A GRIEF
298-126790-0008_7278-246956-0014 THAT SEEMED SO OVERWHELMING A NEARER VIEW OF THE DISTURBED FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CONFIRMED MISS PEYTON IN HER BELIEF AND WITH THE SHOCK THAT GENTLE FEELINGS EVER EXPERIENCE AT A SUDDEN AND ENDLESS SEPARATION FROM EVEN THE MEANEST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES SHE SAID HASTILY
298-126790-0010_1553-140047-0006 AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
298-126790-0013_6531-61334-0003 THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
298-126790-0017_2289-152257-0011 BUT THEN I HAVE LEFT MY WAGES FOR THREE YEARS PAST IN THE HANDS OF HARVEY AND HOW AM I TO GET THEM MY BROTHERS TOLD ME AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RELATIONS WERE EASILY SETTLED WERE YOU RELATED THEN TO BIRCH ASKED MISS PEYTON OBSERVING HER TO PAUSE
298-126790-0018_2384-152900-0015 WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
298-126790-0023_27-123349-0058 HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
298-126790-0027_5192-19397-0005 BUT I SUPPOSE HIS TIME HAD COME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE WHAT DOCTOR'S STUFF WE TAKE LET ME SET YOU RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR INTERRUPTED THE SURGEON WE MUST ALL DIE IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PERMITTED US TO USE THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN ARRESTING DANGERS AS THEY OCCUR UNTIL
298-126790-0029_5456-58161-0007 WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE CASE NO ONE YET SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH QUICKNESS I EXPECT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE SURGEON DISREGARDED THE SMILE OF THE LADIES AND PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES IT IS DOUBTLESS WISE TO BE PREPARED FOR DEATH BUT UNDER WHOSE CARE WAS THE SICK MAN DURING HIS INDISPOSITION
298-126790-0031_211-122442-0076 I DOCTORED HIM MOSTLY WITH YARBS SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER SMILING AS IF CONSCIOUS OF ERROR WITH SIMPLES RETURNED THE SURGEON THEY ARE SAFER IN THE HANDS OF THE UNLETTERED THAN MORE POWERFUL REMEDIES BUT WHY HAD YOU NO REGULAR ATTENDANT
298-126790-0032_481-123719-0032 I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
298-126790-0033_5561-41616-0001 DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
298-126790-0034_7264-92310-0025 FOR MY PART I AM CLEAR FOR DOCTORING THOUGH HARVEY SAYS I AM KILLING MYSELF WITH MEDICINES
298-126790-0036_7402-59171-0032 YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
298-126790-0039_7067-76048-0022 IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
298-126790-0042_1116-137572-0028 THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATED A MOMENT AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT THE SURGEON EXPRESSED YET SHE FELT IT WAS BOTH COMPLIMENTARY AND KIND THEREFORE SUPPRESSING HER NATURAL FLOW OF LANGUAGE A LITTLE SHE REPLIED
298-126790-0043_1578-140049-0011 I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
298-126791-0002_1246-124548-0003 HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE

298-126791-0010_1743-142912-0000 IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
298-126791-0011_7367-86737-0031 EVERYTHING IS AS YOU LEFT IT BUT IT GLIDED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH THE GRACE OF A FAIRY AND THE TENDERNESS OF AN ANGEL

298-126791-0017_5022-29411-0055 AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN
298-126791-0018_8580-287363-0017 IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE

298-126791-0029_2092-145706-0037 HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
298-126791-0031_3723-171115-0039 THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE

302-123504-0005_6818-68772-0011 DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
302-123504-0006_1447-130551-0007 BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
302-123504-0012_254-145458-0006 I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
302-123504-0014_78-368-0021 I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
302-123504-0015_831-130739-0026 WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
302-123504-0017_4137-11702-0038 I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
302-123504-0019_441-130108-0041 EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
302-123504-0020_2514-149482-0105 IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
302-123504-0023_1088-129236-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0026_3486-166424-0005 MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
302-123504-0027_5104-33406-0052 THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
302-123504-0028_3807-4923-0044 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123504-0030_5750-100289-0073 WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
302-123504-0031_5104-33407-0008 AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
302-123504-0032_1867-154071-0008 THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
302-123504-0035_8088-284756-0097 BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
302-123516-0001_8425-292520-0026 AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
302-123516-0002_3440-171006-0022 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003_6272-70191-0001 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0004_3240-131231-0018 AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
302-123516-0007_2007-149877-0048 WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
302-123516-0010_458-126294-0004 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123516-0012_696-92939-0009 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0013_3214-167602-0034 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0015_8226-274371-0050 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0017_60-121082-0014 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0019_8465-246943-0013 AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
302-123516-0020_2989-138035-0073 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0022_4441-76262-0003 BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
302-123516-0024_3214-167607-0021 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0026_1502-122619-0057 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027_7780-274562-0053 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0029_3112-9554-0005 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0031_1841-150351-0015 I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
302-123523-0000_26-495-0046 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001_8312-279791-0029 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0006_89-219-0058 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007_4137-11702-0058 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008_2893-139322-0045 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009_3982-182255-0021 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0011_3214-167602-0001 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012_3807-4955-0016 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0014_6818-68772-0026 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0020_2196-170151-0025 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0023_831-130739-0020 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024_2384-152900-0030 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0027_200-126784-0004 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028_887-123289-0031 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029_441-128982-0032 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030_7190-90542-0006 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0032_1737-142397-0015 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE

307-127540-0009_4018-103416-0029 WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
307-127540-0010_8630-305212-0026 FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
307-127540-0011_1081-128618-0007 AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
307-127540-0013_6081-42010-0027 NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
307-127540-0014_4014-186176-0027 A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
307-127540-0016_3607-29116-0032 AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
307-127540-0017_1898-145724-0010 AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
307-127540-0019_1116-132851-0023 AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
307-127540-0020_1235-135883-0030 AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
307-127540-0025_4481-17499-0026 SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
307-127540-0026_6563-285357-0006 THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
307-127540-0028_254-12312-0008 WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
307-127540-0030_289-121665-0039 CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
307-127540-0031_1963-142393-0032 MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
311-124404-0002_1737-142397-0010 I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
311-124404-0004_8465-246940-0031 TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
311-124404-0006_7517-100442-0024 BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
311-124404-0008_248-130652-0022 TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
311-124404-0010_8095-274346-0050 FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
311-124404-0013_5104-33407-0026 AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
311-124404-0015_3168-173564-0019 FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
311-124404-0017_5339-14134-0074 THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
311-124404-0020_3983-5371-0058 AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
311-124404-0021_8051-118101-0000 AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0025_3436-172162-0007 I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
311-124404-0030_87-121553-0039 BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
311-124404-0032_6476-57446-0048 IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
311-124404-0036_7367-86737-0086 OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
311-124404-0038_125-121124-0052 AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
311-124404-0043_5867-48852-0014 AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
311-124404-0044_8630-305213-0040 WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
311-124404-0046_3235-28452-0013 TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
311-124404-0050_328-129766-0046 WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
311-124404-0051_4859-22176-0013 TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0053_1034-121119-0037 WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
311-124404-0054_8975-270782-0063 AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
311-124404-0056_2289-152254-0004 FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
311-124404-0060_7059-77897-0002 OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
311-124404-0062_8088-284756-0107 AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
311-124404-0063_7312-92432-0014 VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
311-124404-0065_6880-216547-0005 IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
311-124404-0066_3879-174923-0032 TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
311-124404-0069_6181-216552-0102 AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
311-124404-0074_3436-172162-0051 TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
311-124404-0075_3214-167606-0004 WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
311-124404-0079_3436-172162-0038 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0080_909-131045-0026 IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
311-124404-0081_1334-135589-0028 SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
311-124404-0082_125-121124-0011 AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
311-124404-0084_229-130880-0011 AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
311-124404-0085_8051-119902-0021 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
311-124404-0086_5688-41232-0051 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0089_8238-274553-0065 IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
311-124404-0090_1970-26100-0030 ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
311-124404-0091_374-180298-0032 PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0092_1898-145724-0033 IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
311-124404-0096_198-209-0029 WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
311-124404-0099_3879-174923-0048 TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
311-124404-0100_3947-13260-0044 MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
311-124404-0105_32-21631-0017 APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
311-124404-0106_3983-5371-0021 THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
311-124404-0109_27-123349-0008 AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
311-124404-0111_5463-39174-0034 SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
311-124404-0112_4137-11701-0013 AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0113_2007-132570-0043 SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
311-124404-0116_7226-86965-0040 CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
311-124404-0117_8609-283227-0018 AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
311-124404-0118_289-121665-0036 BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
3112-9554-0001_6385-34655-0031 EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WILL GIVE HERE AS MUCH OF IT AS CONCERNS THE PUBLIC I WISH YOU TO ACCEPT AS A GIFT FROM ME GIVEN YOU NOW THE ACCOMPANYING PAGES WHICH CONTAIN A MEMOIR OF MY LIFE
3112-9554-0002_1926-147987-0002 MY INTENTION IS THAT THEY SHALL BE PUBLISHED AFTER MY DEATH AND BE EDITED BY YOU BUT I LEAVE IT ALTOGETHER TO YOUR DISCRETION WHETHER TO PUBLISH OR TO SUPPRESS THE WORK AND ALSO TO YOUR DISCRETION WHETHER ANY PART OR WHAT PART SHALL BE OMITTED
3112-9554-0006_1578-140049-0006 THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HUNTING BUT HE STILL KEPT TWO HORSES FOR SUCH RIDING AS MAY BE HAD IN OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON HE CONTINUED TO RIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE LIKED THE EXERCISE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED HIM NOT TO HAVE HAD A HORSE IN HIS STABLE
3112-9554-0007_311-124404-0110 BUT HE NEVER SPOKE WILLINGLY ON HUNTING MATTERS HE HAD AT LAST RESOLVED TO GIVE UP HIS FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT AND THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THERE SHOULD BE AN END OF IT IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA
3112-9554-0012_1926-147987-0021 EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AYALA'S ANGEL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE DOCTOR WORTLE'S SCHOOL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE FRAU FROHMANN AND OTHER STORIES EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO
3112-9554-0015_125-121342-0018 I THINK HE CHOSE THAT SPOT BECAUSE HE FOUND THERE A HOUSE THAT SUITED HIM AND BECAUSE OF THE PRETTINESS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HIS LAST LONG JOURNEY WAS A TRIP TO ITALY IN THE LATE WINTER AND SPRING OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
3112-9554-0017_481-123720-0016 FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN AUGUST FOLLOWING HE MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO IRELAND BUT FROM THIS JOURNEY HE DERIVED LESS BENEFIT HE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN AND WAS VERY MUCH DISTRESSED BY THE UNHAPPY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY
3112-9554-0018_412-126975-0062 FEW MEN KNEW IRELAND BETTER THAN HE DID HE HAD LIVED THERE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND HIS POST OFFICE WORK HAD TAKEN HIM INTO EVERY PART OF THE ISLAND IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE BEGAN HIS LAST NOVEL
3112-9554-0019_1926-147987-0011 THE LANDLEAGUERS WHICH AS STATED ABOVE WAS UNFINISHED WHEN HE DIED THIS BOOK WAS A CAUSE OF ANXIETY TO HIM HE COULD NOT RID HIS MIND OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD A STORY ALREADY IN THE COURSE OF PUBLICATION BUT WHICH HE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED
3112-9554-0022_4267-287369-0024 NEARLY FIVE WEEKS FROM THE NIGHT OF HIS ATTACK I HAVE BEEN LED TO SAY THESE FEW WORDS NOT AT ALL FROM A DESIRE TO SUPPLEMENT MY FATHER'S BIOGRAPHY OF HIMSELF BUT TO MENTION THE MAIN INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS OWN RECORD
3112-9555-0000_2817-142380-0006 CHAPTER ONE MY EDUCATION
3112-9555-0003_5688-41232-0016 AND YET THE GARRULITY OF OLD AGE AND THE APTITUDE OF A MAN'S MIND TO RECUR TO THE PASSAGES OF HIS OWN LIFE WILL I KNOW TEMPT ME TO SAY SOMETHING OF MYSELF
3112-9555-0007_6476-57446-0002 I WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN KEPPEL STREET RUSSELL SQUARE AND WHILE A BABY WAS CARRIED DOWN TO HARROW WHERE MY FATHER HAD BUILT A HOUSE ON A LARGE FARM
3112-9555-0008_7367-86737-0021 AND PERHAPS THE DIRECTOR OF HER DESTINY AND OF OURS MY FATHER HAD BEEN A WYKAMIST AND A FELLOW OF NEW COLLEGE AND WINCHESTER WAS THE DESTINATION OF MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF
3112-9555-0015_3723-171115-0009 WITHOUT A DAILY PURGATORY NO DOUBT MY APPEARANCE WAS AGAINST ME I REMEMBER WELL WHEN I WAS STILL THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL DOCTOR BUTLER THE HEAD MASTER STOPPING ME IN THE STREET AND ASKING ME
3112-9555-0016_27-123349-0021 PERHAPS HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME BY MY FACE AT THIS TIME I WAS THREE YEARS AT HARROW AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER I WAS THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL WHEN I LEFT IT
3112-9555-0020_3486-166424-0046 MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEADER OF WICKEDNESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM HE WHISPERED TO ME HALF A WORD THAT PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN WRONG WITH ALL A STUPID BOY'S SLOWNESS I SAID NOTHING
3112-9555-0022_7402-90848-0059 AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I REMEMBER THEIR NAMES WELL AND ALMOST WISH TO WRITE THEM HERE WHEN I WAS TWELVE THERE CAME THE VACANCY AT WINCHESTER COLLEGE WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO FILL
3112-9555-0024_6181-216552-0092 SHOULD ALL BECOME FELLOWS OF NEW COLLEGE BUT THAT SUFFERING MAN WAS NEVER DESTINED TO HAVE AN AMBITION GRATIFIED WE ALL LOST THE PRIZE WHICH HE STRUGGLED WITH INFINITE LABOUR TO PUT WITHIN OUR REACH
3112-9555-0031_8580-287363-0035 I HAVE NO CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF HER OBJECT OR OF MY FATHER'S BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT MONEY MIGHT BE MADE BY SENDING GOODS LITTLE GOODS SUCH AS PIN CUSHIONS PEPPER BOXES AND POCKET KNIVES OUT TO THE STILL UNFURNISHED STATES
3112-9555-0033_8226-274369-0015 THEN MY FATHER FOLLOWED THEM TAKING MY ELDER BROTHER BEFORE HE WENT TO OXFORD
3112-9555-0034_2893-139310-0051 THERE HAVE BEEN HOT WORDS BETWEEN US FOR PERFECT FRIENDSHIP BEARS AND ALLOWS HOT WORDS FEW BROTHERS HAVE HAD MORE OF BROTHERHOOD BUT IN THOSE SCHOOL DAYS HE WAS OF ALL MY FOES THE WORST
3112-9555-0035_250-140277-0008 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRACTICE OF THE COLLEGE WHICH SUBMITS OR DID THEN SUBMIT MUCH OF THE TUITION OF THE YOUNGER BOYS FROM THE ELDER HE WAS MY TUTOR AND IN HIS CAPACITY OF TEACHER AND RULER
3112-9555-0036_4853-27671-0018 HE HAD STUDIED THE THEORIES OF DRACO
3112-9555-0039_226-131533-0017 SEEMS TO ME TO ARGUE A VERY ILL CONDITION OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AT THIS PERIOD I REMEMBER TO HAVE PASSED ONE SET OF HOLIDAYS THE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS IN MY FATHER'S CHAMBERS IN LINCOLN'S INN
3112-9555-0040_83-9960-0019 THERE WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH ME ON THIS OCCASION MY AMUSEMENT CONSISTED IN WANDERING ABOUT AMONG THOSE OLD DESERTED BUILDINGS AND IN READING SHAKESPEARE OUT OF A BI COLUMNED EDITION
3112-9555-0044_5652-39938-0028 IT IS THE NATURE OF BOYS TO BE CRUEL I HAVE SOMETIMES DOUBTED WHETHER AMONG EACH OTHER THEY DO USUALLY SUFFER MUCH ONE FROM THE OTHER'S CRUELTY BUT I SUFFERED HORRIBLY
3112-9555-0046_3240-131232-0014 OF COURSE I WAS ILL DRESSED AND DIRTY BUT AH HOW WELL I REMEMBER ALL THE AGONIES OF MY YOUNG HEART HOW I CONSIDERED WHETHER I SHOULD ALWAYS BE ALONE
3112-9555-0047_625-132112-0041 WHETHER I COULD NOT FIND MY WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT COLLEGE TOWER AND FROM THENCE PUT AN END TO EVERYTHING AND A WORSE THING CAME THAN THE STOPPAGE OF THE SUPPLIES FROM THE SHOPKEEPERS EVERY BOY HAD A SHILLING A WEEK POCKET MONEY WHICH WE CALLED BATTELS
3112-9555-0049_2764-36619-0016 THE BATTELS FOR THE LAST HALF YEAR HAD NOT BEEN REPAID AND HE URGED HIS OWN UNWILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE THE MONEY THE LOSS OF A SHILLING A WEEK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH EVEN THOUGH POCKET MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES NEVER REACHED ME
3112-9555-0050_6078-54013-0017 AND NOW WHEN IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ANY SERVANT HE RECEIVED SIXTY NINE SHILLINGS INSTEAD OF SEVENTY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DEFALCATION WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM
3112-9555-0051_4640-19189-0023 WHEN I HAD BEEN AT WINCHESTER SOMETHING OVER THREE YEARS MY FATHER RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND TOOK ME AWAY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OR BECAUSE MY CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY
3112-9555-0055_233-134440-0028 BUT I PASSED MY MOST JOCUND HOURS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING INNOCENT LOVE TO THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER THE FARM KITCHEN MIGHT BE VERY WELL THROUGH THE EVENING WHEN THE HORRORS OF THE SCHOOL WERE OVER BUT IT ALL ADDED TO THE CRUELTY OF THE DAYS
3112-9555-0063_3607-29116-0040 I WISH I COULD GIVE SOME ADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE GLOOM OF THAT FARMHOUSE MY ELDER BROTHER TOM AS I MUST CALL HIM IN MY NARRATIVE THOUGH THE WORLD I THINK KNOWS HIM BEST AS ADOLPHUS WAS AT OXFORD
3112-9555-0064_8975-270782-0108 MY FATHER AND I LIVED TOGETHER HE HAVING NO MEANS OF LIVING EXCEPT WHAT CAME FROM THE FARM MY MEMORY TELLS ME THAT HE WAS ALWAYS IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLORD AND TO THE TRADESMEN HE EMPLOYED
3112-9555-0069_7302-86815-0022 THREE NUMBERS OUT OF EIGHT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED BY SUBSCRIPTION AND ARE NOW I FEAR UNKNOWN AND BURIED IN THE MIDST OF THAT HUGE PILE OF FUTILE LITERATURE THE BUILDING UP OF WHICH HAS BROKEN SO MANY HEARTS
3112-9555-0071_6880-216547-0111 AND SAY MY EARLY RULES FROM THE LATIN GRAMMAR OR REPEAT THE GREEK ALPHABET AND WAS OBLIGED AT THESE EARLY LESSONS TO HOLD MY HEAD INCLINED TOWARDS HIM
3112-9555-0076_3699-175950-0016 IN THE OLD HOUSE WERE THE TWO FIRST VOLUMES OF COOPER'S NOVEL CALLED THE PRAIRIE A RELIC PROBABLY A DISHONEST RELIC OF SOME SUBSCRIPTION TO HOOKHAM'S LIBRARY OTHER BOOKS OF THE KIND THERE WAS NONE
3112-9555-0078_8747-293952-0015 IT WAS THE HORROR OF THOSE DREADFUL WALKS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHICH MADE MY LIFE SO BAD WHAT SO PLEASANT WHAT SO SWEET AS A WALK ALONG AN ENGLISH LANE WHEN THE AIR IS SWEET AND THE WEATHER FINE
3112-9555-0081_4051-11217-0038 SHE LIVED AT FIRST AT THE FARMHOUSE BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME SHE CAME BACK WITH A BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND THE IMMEDIATE PECUNIARY SUCCESS WHICH THAT WORK OBTAINED ENABLED HER TO TAKE US ALL BACK TO THE HOUSE AT HARROW
3112-9555-0082_5808-54425-0033 NOT TO THE FIRST HOUSE WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN BEYOND HER MEANS BUT TO THAT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CALLED ORLEY FARM AND WHICH WAS AN EDEN AS COMPARED TO OUR ABODE AT HARROW WEALD
3112-9555-0083_4195-186236-0002 HERE MY SCHOOLING WENT ON UNDER SOMEWHAT IMPROVED CIRCUMSTANCES THE THREE MILES BECAME HALF A MILE AND PROBABLY SOME SALUTARY CHANGES WERE MADE IN MY WARDROBE
3112-9555-0084_6848-252323-0032 AND A GREAT ELEMENT OF HAPPINESS WAS ADDED TO US ALL IN THE AFFECTIONATE AND LIFE ENDURING FRIENDSHIP OF THE FAMILY OF OUR CLOSE NEIGHBOUR COLONEL GRANT BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO OVERCOME OR EVEN TO ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THE ABSOLUTE ISOLATION OF MY SCHOOL POSITION
3112-9555-0087_4088-158077-0036 AND I HAD AT FIRST GONE THERE AT SEVEN DURING THE WHOLE OF THOSE TWELVE YEARS NO ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO TEACH ME ANYTHING BUT LATIN AND GREEK AND VERY LITTLE ATTEMPT TO TEACH ME THOSE LANGUAGES
3112-9555-0088_1069-133709-0043 AT THE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY THERE WAS CERTAINLY A WRITING MASTER AND A FRENCH MASTER THE LATTER WAS AN EXTRA AND I NEVER HAD EXTRAS
3112-9555-0089_5104-33406-0005 I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WRITING MASTER'S CLASS BUT THOUGH I CAN CALL TO MIND THE MAN I CANNOT CALL TO MIND HIS FERULE IT WAS BY THEIR FERULES THAT I ALWAYS KNEW THEM AND THEY ME
3112-9555-0090_60-121082-0068 I FEEL CONVINCED IN MY MIND THAT I HAVE BEEN FLOGGED OFTENER THAN ANY HUMAN BEING ALIVE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN FIVE SCOURGINGS IN ONE DAY AT WINCHESTER
3112-9555-0092_3723-171631-0005 I AM NOW A FAIR LATIN SCHOLAR THAT IS TO SAY I READ AND ENJOY THE LATIN CLASSICS AND COULD PROBABLY MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD IN LATIN PROSE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAVE I HAVE ACQUIRED SINCE I LEFT SCHOOL

3168-173564-0010_1069-133699-0017 THEN TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HER LIPS AS IF TO FEEL WHETHER SHE WAS FEVERISH AND FINALLY KISSED HER YOU ARE COLD
3168-173564-0011_2136-5143-0032 LIE DOWN ALL RIGHT I WILL I'LL LIE DOWN AT ONCE SAID NATASHA

3168-173564-0013_2289-152254-0012 EVIDENTLY DISBELIEVING WHAT THEY TOLD HER AND CONVINCED THAT SAY WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE WOULD STILL BE TOLD THE SAME ALL THE WAY SHE HAD SAT MOTIONLESS IN A CORNER OF THE COACH WITH WIDE OPEN EYES
3168-173564-0014_7226-86965-0001 AND THE EXPRESSION IN THEM WHICH THE COUNTESS KNEW SO WELL AND FEARED SO MUCH AND NOW SHE SAT IN THE SAME WAY ON THE BENCH WHERE SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON ARRIVING SHE WAS PLANNING SOMETHING AND EITHER
3168-173564-0016_4640-19188-0003 A BED HAD BEEN MADE ON A BEDSTEAD FOR THE COUNTESS ONLY MADAME SCHOSS AND THE TWO GIRLS WERE TO SLEEP ON SOME HAY ON THE FLOOR NO MAMMA I WILL LIE DOWN HERE ON THE FLOOR NATASHA REPLIED IRRITABLY
3168-173564-0017_5678-43302-0026 AND SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW THE MOANS OF THE ADJUTANT COULD BE HEARD MORE DISTINCTLY SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT INTO THE DAMP NIGHT AIR AND THE COUNTESS SAW HER SLIM NECK SHAKING WITH SOBS AND THROBBING AGAINST THE WINDOW FRAME
3168-173564-0020_7511-102420-0021 I'LL LIE DOWN AT ONCE SAID NATASHA AND BEGAN HURRIEDLY UNDRESSING TUGGING AT THE TAPES OF HER PETTICOAT WHEN SHE HAD THROWN OFF HER DRESS AND PUT ON A DRESSING JACKET
3168-173564-0021_2391-145015-0069 THAT HAD BEEN MADE UP ON THE FLOOR JERKED HER THIN AND RATHER SHORT PLAIT OF HAIR TO THE FRONT AND BEGAN REPLAITING IT
3168-173564-0023_8838-298546-0012 WHEN HER TOILET FOR THE NIGHT WAS FINISHED SHE SANK GENTLY ONTO THE SHEET SPREAD OVER THE HAY ON THE SIDE NEAREST THE DOOR NATASHA YOU'D BETTER LIE IN THE MIDDLE SAID SONYA I'LL STAY HERE MUTTERED NATASHA

3168-173564-0028_696-93314-0013 AFTER A SHORT SILENCE THE COUNTESS SPOKE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME NO ONE REPLIED SOON AFTER THAT NATASHA HEARD HER MOTHER'S EVEN BREATHING NATASHA DID NOT MOVE THOUGH HER LITTLE BARE FOOT
3168-173564-0031_5652-39938-0063 NO ONE REPLIED NATASHA ROSE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY CROSSED HERSELF AND STEPPED CAUTIOUSLY ON THE COLD AND DIRTY FLOOR WITH HER SLIM SUPPLE BARE FEET THE BOARDS OF THE FLOOR CREAKED
3168-173564-0032_2836-5354-0019 STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER SHE RAN LIKE A KITTEN THE FEW STEPS TO THE DOOR AND GRASPED THE COLD DOOR HANDLE IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SOMETHING HEAVY WAS BEATING RHYTHMICALLY AGAINST ALL THE WALLS OF THE ROOM
3168-173564-0035_3242-67168-0025 ON WHICH SOMETHING WAS LYING STOOD A TALLOW CANDLE WITH A LONG THICK AND SMOLDERING WICK FROM THE MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND HIS PRESENCE THERE NATASHA HAD RESOLVED TO SEE HIM
3168-173564-0038_3486-166424-0024 WAS HE LIKE THAT INCESSANT MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT'S YES HE WAS ALTOGETHER LIKE THAT IN HER IMAGINATION HE WAS THAT TERRIBLE MOANING PERSONIFIED WHEN SHE SAW AN INDISTINCT SHAPE IN THE CORNER AND MISTOOK HIS KNEES
3168-173564-0041_7059-77900-0029 THE VALET SAT UP AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TIMOKHIN KEPT AWAKE BY THE PAIN IN HIS WOUNDED LEG GAZED WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AT THIS STRANGE APPARITION OF A GIRL IN A WHITE
3168-173565-0000_254-145458-0016 SEVEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AMBULANCE STATION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO HIS FEVERISH STATE AND THE INFLAMMATION OF HIS BOWELS WHICH WERE INJURED
3168-173565-0002_6000-55211-0050 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0003_6367-74004-0035 WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS CAMP BED HE LAY FOR A LONG TIME MOTIONLESS WITH CLOSED EYES THEN HE OPENED THEM AND WHISPERED SOFTLY AND THE TEA HIS REMEMBERING SUCH A SMALL DETAIL OF EVERYDAY LIFE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0006_839-130898-0000 PRINCE ANDREW'S VALET HIS COACHMAN AND TWO ORDERLIES THEY GAVE PRINCE ANDREW SOME TEA HE DRANK IT EAGERLY LOOKING WITH FEVERISH EYES AT THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER SOMETHING
3168-173565-0007_6081-41997-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY MORE IS TIMOKHIN HERE HE ASKED TIMOKHIN CREPT ALONG THE BENCH TO HIM I AM HERE YOUR EXCELLENCY HOW'S YOUR WOUND MINE SIR
3168-173565-0013_5778-12761-0046 HE PLEADED IN A PITEOUS VOICE THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE PASSAGE TO WASH HIS HANDS YOU FELLOWS HAVE NO CONSCIENCE SAID HE TO THE VALET WHO WAS POURING WATER OVER HIS HANDS
3168-173565-0017_4267-78186-0036 THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
3168-173565-0018_1069-133699-0049 THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AGAIN CONFUSED HIS THOUGHTS AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF A THIRD TIME IT WAS IN THE COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT EVERYBODY NEAR HIM WAS SLEEPING A CRICKET CHIRPED FROM ACROSS THE PASSAGE
3168-173565-0020_1963-142393-0017 HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
3168-173565-0021_1594-135914-0038 A HEALTHY MAN CAN TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE DEEPEST REFLECTIONS TO SAY A CIVIL WORD TO SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND CAN THEN RETURN AGAIN TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3168-173565-0022_39-121916-0005 ALL THE POWERS OF HIS MIND WERE MORE ACTIVE AND CLEARER THAN EVER BUT THEY ACTED APART FROM HIS WILL MOST DIVERSE THOUGHTS AND IMAGES OCCUPIED HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT TIMES HIS BRAIN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO WORK WITH A VIGOR CLEARNESS AND DEPTH
3168-173565-0025_403-128339-0016 EVERY MAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO CONCEIVE IT AND ENJOIN IT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR GOD BUT HOW DID GOD ENJOIN THAT LAW AND WHY WAS THE SON AND SUDDENLY THE SEQUENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS BROKE OFF
3168-173565-0029_5339-14134-0068 WHISPERED RHYTHMIC MUSIC IT STRETCHES STRETCHES SPREADING OUT AND STRETCHING SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF WHILE LISTENING TO THIS WHISPERING AND FEELING THE SENSATION OF THIS DRAWING OUT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EDIFICE OF NEEDLES
3168-173565-0031_8630-305212-0018 EACH TIME THE FLY TOUCHED HIS FACE IT GAVE HIM A BURNING SENSATION AND YET TO HIS SURPRISE IT DID NOT DESTROY THE STRUCTURE THOUGH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE VERY REGION OF HIS FACE WHERE IT WAS RISING
3168-173565-0037_1502-122619-0003 IS HE ALIVE WHEN LOVING WITH HUMAN LOVE ONE MAY PASS FROM LOVE TO HATRED BUT DIVINE LOVE CANNOT CHANGE NO NEITHER DEATH NOR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DESTROY IT IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
3168-173565-0039_5163-39921-0038 NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
3168-173565-0046_5750-100289-0063 HE MOVED A LITTLE AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A RINGING IN HIS EARS
3168-173565-0047_1447-130551-0024 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF NATASHA THAT SAME LIVING NATASHA WHOM OF ALL PEOPLE HE MOST LONGED TO LOVE WITH THIS NEW PURE DIVINE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0049_6081-41997-0024 WITH FRIGHTENED EYES RIVETED ON HIM WAS RESTRAINING HER SOBS HER FACE WAS PALE AND RIGID ONLY IN THE LOWER PART OF IT SOMETHING QUIVERED PRINCE ANDREW SIGHED WITH RELIEF SMILED
3168-173565-0050_8630-305212-0033 AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
3168-173565-0051_458-126305-0023 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0055_19-227-0029 WAS MORE THAN PLAIN IT WAS DREADFUL BUT PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE THAT HE SAW HER SHINING EYES WHICH WERE BEAUTIFUL THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES BEHIND THEM PETER THE VALET WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE HAD ROUSED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0057_2007-149877-0006 PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
3168-173565-0058_6209-34599-0030 FELL SOBBING ON HER BED FROM THAT TIME DURING ALL THE REST OF THE ROSTOVS JOURNEY AT EVERY HALTING PLACE AND WHEREVER THEY SPENT A NIGHT NATASHA NEVER LEFT THE WOUNDED BOLKONSKI
3168-173565-0059_6476-96661-0000 AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG GIRL EITHER SUCH FIRMNESS OR SUCH SKILL IN NURSING A WOUNDED MAN DREADFUL AS THE COUNTESS IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SHOULD PRINCE ANDREW DIE IN HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS DURING THE JOURNEY
3168-173565-0060_839-130898-0096 AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
3168-173565-0061_8098-278278-0032 NO ONE LEAST OF ALL NATASHA AND PRINCE ANDREW SPOKE OF THIS THE UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH WHICH HUNG NOT ONLY OVER BOLKONSKI BUT OVER ALL RUSSIA
32-21625-0001_909-131045-0028 THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
32-21625-0003_3440-171009-0000 EVERYBODY THAT DWELT THERE WAS A FINE SWIMMER YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE BROWNIE'S TIME HIS FOREFATHERS HAD COME THERE AND FINDING THAT THERE WERE MANY TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE SORT OF BARK THEY LIKED TO EAT
32-21625-0005_4898-28461-0011 AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
32-21625-0007_3436-172162-0009 SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
32-21625-0011_446-123502-0033 AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
32-21625-0012_8324-286682-0005 IT WAS SO OLD THAT TREES WERE GROWING ON IT AND THERE WAS AN ODD THING ABOUT IT IT WAS NEVER FINISHED THOUGH BROWNIE BEAVER WAS A YOUNG CHAP HE WORKED ON THE DAM SOMETIMES LIKE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
32-21625-0013_2843-152918-0051 YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
32-21625-0014_4297-13006-0031 AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
32-21625-0015_4813-248638-0044 IN ORDER TO HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN COLD WEATHER CAME AND THE ICE CLOSED THEIR POND SOME OF THEIR FOOD THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES THROUGH A STRAIGHT HALL WHICH WAS MADE FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE
32-21625-0016_7402-59171-0005 AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
32-21631-0000_8630-305213-0028 AFTER MISTER CROW FLEW BACK TO PLEASANT VALLEY TO GATHER NEWS FOR HIM BROWNIE BEAVER CAREFULLY COUNTED EACH DAY THAT PASSED SINCE MISTER CROW HAD AGREED TO BE HIS NEWSPAPER AND COME EACH SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE WEEK

32-4137-0024_446-123501-0008 AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
32-4137-0025_6818-76332-0026 ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
32-4137-0027_289-121665-0019 AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
32-4137-0028_6880-216547-0018 THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
32-4137-0029_2196-170151-0033 AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL

32-4137-0040_89-219-0040 THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS

3214-167602-0006_909-131045-0034 THE PEASANTS IN THE CROWD WERE SIMILARLY IMPRESSED WHEN THEY SAW ROSTOV'S RAPID FIRM STEPS AND RESOLUTE FROWNING FACE AFTER THE HUSSARS HAD COME TO THE VILLAGE AND ROSTOV HAD GONE TO SEE THE PRINCESS A CERTAIN CONFUSION AND DISSENSION HAD ARISEN AMONG THE CROWD
3214-167602-0007_6836-76549-0005 SOME OF THE PEASANTS SAID THAT THESE NEW ARRIVALS WERE RUSSIANS AND MIGHT TAKE IT AMISS THAT THE MISTRESS WAS BEING DETAINED DRON WAS OF THIS OPINION BUT AS SOON AS HE EXPRESSED IT KARP AND OTHERS ATTACKED THEIR EX ELDER HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEEN FATTENING ON THE COMMUNE

3214-167602-0021_1970-10594-0035 TWO HOURS LATER THE CARTS WERE STANDING IN THE COURTYARD OF THE BOGUCHAROVO HOUSE THE PEASANTS WERE BRISKLY CARRYING OUT THE PROPRIETOR'S GOODS AND PACKING THEM ON THE CARTS AND DRON LIBERATED AT PRINCESS MARY'S WISH FROM THE CUPBOARD WHERE HE HAD BEEN CONFINED
3214-167602-0022_229-130880-0000 WAS STANDING IN THE YARD DIRECTING THE MEN DON'T PUT IT IN SO CARELESSLY SAID ONE OF THE PEASANTS

3214-167602-0028_8063-274117-0011 SAID HE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME AND WISHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
3214-167602-0030_7517-100429-0009 THANKED HIM WITH THE WHOLE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE RADIANT WITH GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO THANK HIM FOR ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO HER CERTAIN THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE SHE WOULD HAVE PERISHED AT THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS AND OF THE FRENCH
3214-167602-0032_5688-41232-0039 MORE THAN ONCE NOTICED THAT HER MISTRESS LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SMILED AT SOMETHING WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED JOY AND SORROW WELL SUPPOSING I DO LOVE HIM THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY ASHAMED AS SHE WAS OF ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN WHO
3214-167602-0033_6147-34605-0027 WOULD PERHAPS NEVER LOVE HER SHE COMFORTED HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW IT AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE TO BLAME IF WITHOUT EVER SPEAKING OF IT TO ANYONE SHE CONTINUED TO THE END OF HER LIFE TO LOVE THE MAN WITH WHOM SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HER LIFE
3214-167602-0035_7190-90542-0005 AND THAT CAUSED HIS SISTER TO REFUSE MY BROTHER AND IN ALL THIS PRINCESS MARY SAW THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE THE IMPRESSION THE PRINCESS MADE ON ROSTOV WAS A VERY AGREEABLE ONE TO REMEMBER HER GAVE HIM PLEASURE
3214-167602-0037_4441-76263-0023 AND HAD AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE HAD AGAINST HIS WILL MORE THAN ONCE ENTERED HIS HEAD FOR HIMSELF PERSONALLY NICHOLAS COULD NOT WISH FOR A BETTER WIFE BY MARRYING HER HE WOULD MAKE THE COUNTESS HIS MOTHER HAPPY WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IN ORDER
3214-167606-0001_1069-133699-0037 ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS GLAD THAT LADIES AND TRADESMEN'S WIVES WERE LEAVING THE CITY THERE WILL BE LESS PANIC AND LESS GOSSIP RAN THE BROADSHEET
3214-167606-0003_7859-102518-0009 WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF HIS SOUL BUT WHICH YET AROUSED INVOLUNTARY HORROR IN HIM WAS DRAWING NEAR SHALL I JOIN THE ARMY AND ENTER THE SERVICE

3214-167606-0019_8098-275181-0011 VORONTSOVO TO SEE THE GREAT BALLOON LEPPICH WAS CONSTRUCTING TO DESTROY THE FOE AND A TRIAL BALLOON THAT WAS TO GO UP NEXT DAY THE BALLOON WAS NOT YET READY BUT PIERRE LEARNED THAT IT WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED BY THE EMPEROR'S DESIRE
3214-167606-0020_3807-4923-0015 GET TOGETHER A CREW OF RELIABLE AND INTELLIGENT MEN FOR HIS CAR AND SEND A COURIER TO GENERAL KUTUZOV TO LET HIM KNOW I HAVE INFORMED HIM OF THE MATTER PLEASE IMPRESS UPON LEPPICH TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHERE HE DESCENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME
3214-167606-0023_5778-54535-0023 WHO WAS MOANING PITEOUSLY ANOTHER CRIMINAL THIN AND PALE STOOD NEAR JUDGING BY THEIR FACES THEY WERE BOTH FRENCHMEN WITH A FRIGHTENED AND SUFFERING LOOK RESEMBLING THAT ON THE THIN FRENCHMAN'S FACE PIERRE PUSHED HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE CROWD
3214-167606-0031_8063-274117-0032 AND THAT HIS SADDLE HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY SO ON
3214-167606-0032_3664-178366-0003 THIS WAS THE BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE IN PERKHUSHKOVO THE EARTH TREMBLED FROM THE FIRING BUT NOBODY COULD ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS AS TO WHO HAD WON AT DAWN NEXT DAY PIERRE WAS APPROACHING MOZHAYSK
3214-167607-0000_1455-134435-0018 WHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVARDINO AND BORODINO GIVEN AND ACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE
3214-167607-0001_1447-130550-0027 THAT WE WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW WHICH WE FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD AND FOR THE FRENCH ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR WHOLE ARMY WHICH THEY FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
3214-167607-0002_3947-13262-0011 WHAT THE RESULT MUST BE WAS QUITE OBVIOUS AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLE IF THE COMMANDERS HAD BEEN GUIDED BY REASON IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0005_4397-15678-0017 HE WILL BE THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS I AM BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO OUR STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO THE FRENCH WAS ABOUT AS FIVE TO SIX BUT AFTER THAT BATTLE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN ONE TO TWO PREVIOUSLY
3214-167607-0006_5808-54425-0008 WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THE BATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0007_7635-105409-0009 AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEON'S HISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLENSK ONWARDS HE WISHED TO STOP
3214-167607-0009_887-123291-0032 THE HISTORIANS PROVIDED CUNNINGLY DEVISED EVIDENCE
3214-167607-0011_6209-34600-0033 AND WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT FOR OUR EPOCH HISTORIES OF THAT KIND ARE MEANINGLESS ON THE OTHER QUESTION HOW THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE PRECEDING BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO WERE FOUGHT
3214-167607-0013_8063-274116-0038 AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON THE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH WE ARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT
3214-167607-0015_458-126305-0029 THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEK OUT THE BEST POSITION BUT ON THE CONTRARY DURING THE RETREAT PASSED MANY POSITIONS BETTER THAN BORODINO THEY DID NOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTUZOV DID NOT WISH TO OCCUPY A POSITION
3214-167607-0016_1963-142393-0050 HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSE MILORADOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
3214-167607-0017_233-134440-0042 THE FACT IS THAT OTHER POSITIONS THEY HAD PASSED WERE STRONGER AND THAT THE POSITION AT BORODINO THE ONE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT FAR FROM BEING STRONG WAS NO MORE A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER SPOT ONE MIGHT FIND IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE
3214-167607-0019_3235-28433-0004 THAT IS THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN TWELVE DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BE FOUGHT THERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO ENTRENCHMENTS THERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH
3214-167607-0023_5561-39621-0011 WHICH CROSSES THE HIGHROAD NOT AT A RIGHT ANGLE BUT AT AN ACUTE ANGLE SO THAT THE LEFT FLANK WAS AT SHEVARDINO
3214-167607-0025_163-122947-0063 PROTECTED BY THE RIVER KOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOW NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0028_226-122538-0010 AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVING TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED
3214-167607-0029_4859-22176-0007 BY CROSSING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KOLOCHA TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHROAD NAPOLEON SHIFTED THE WHOLE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT LOOKING FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PLAIN BETWEEN UTITSA
3214-167607-0030_3242-67153-0028 SEMENOVSK AND BORODINO A PLAIN NO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER PLAIN IN RUSSIA AND THERE THE WHOLE BATTLE OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST TOOK PLACE
3214-167607-0034_7178-34644-0035 AT GRIDNEVA AND AS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH THE FIRST AND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
3214-167607-0037_3699-47246-0011 NAMELY THE LOSS OF OUR POSITION ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THE SHIFTING OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
3214-167607-0038_7780-274562-0005 AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO MOVE THEIR FORCES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT DURING THE BATTLE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BATTLE THE RUSSIANS OPPOSED THE ENTIRE FRENCH ARMY LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR LEFT FLANK WITH BUT HALF AS MANY MEN
3214-167607-0039_32-4137-0034 PONIATOWSKI'S ACTION AGAINST UTITSA AND UVAROV'S ON THE RIGHT FLANK AGAINST THE FRENCH WERE ACTIONS DISTINCT FROM THE MAIN COURSE OF THE BATTLE SO THE BATTLE OF BORODINO DID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL AS
3214-167607-0040_2136-5143-0023 IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL OUR COMMANDERS MISTAKES EVEN AT THE COST OF DIMINISHING THE GLORY DUE TO THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
322-124146-0000_4214-7146-0063 MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
322-124146-0004_1246-124550-0031 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
322-124146-0006_7635-105409-0027 SHE IS A VERY HEADSTRONG FOOLISH GIRL AND DOES NOT KNOW HER OWN INTEREST BUT I WILL MAKE HER KNOW IT PARDON ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MADAM CRIED MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0010_26-495-0049 HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
322-124146-0012_8975-270782-0054 YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
322-124146-0013_4195-17507-0032 FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
322-124146-0014_2893-139310-0026 MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
322-124146-0019_3214-167607-0014 WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
322-124146-0020_302-123523-0004 I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME FOR THERE IS SUCH FUN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED THIS MORNING
322-124146-0028_7190-90542-0060 ELIZABETH PASSED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM JANE AND KITTY FOLLOWED BUT LYDIA STOOD HER GROUND DETERMINED TO HEAR ALL SHE COULD AND CHARLOTTE
322-124146-0034_481-123719-0035 WITHOUT HAVING PAID YOURSELF AND MISTER BENNET THE COMPLIMENT OF REQUESTING YOU TO INTERPOSE YOUR AUTHORITY IN MY BEHALF
322-124146-0036_4898-20016-0007 I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
322-124147-0004_27-123349-0035 AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
322-124147-0005_4214-7146-0041 AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
322-124147-0006_1926-147987-0012 TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
322-124147-0011_4898-20016-0040 BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
322-124147-0013_1898-145720-0003 TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
322-124147-0014_6415-100596-0018 CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
322-124147-0015_7505-258964-0034 HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
322-124147-0016_8088-284756-0028 AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
322-124147-0019_8629-261140-0010 AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
322-124147-0020_2911-15045-0019 IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
322-124147-0021_307-127539-0014 HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
322-124147-0022_226-131533-0003 WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
322-124147-0025_7278-91083-0032 AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
322-124147-0026_7178-34644-0044 FOR MINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL YOU HEAR IT MOST WILLINGLY YOU SHALL HAVE IT IN A FEW WORDS MISS BINGLEY SEES THAT HER BROTHER IS IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WANTS HIM TO MARRY MISS DARCY
322-124147-0028_7635-105409-0006 NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
322-124147-0030_441-130108-0038 IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
322-124147-0032_328-129766-0009 CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
322-124147-0033_1088-129236-0028 IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
322-124147-0034_8419-293473-0013 EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
322-124147-0035_2391-145015-0096 AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
322-124147-0039_3857-182315-0030 AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
322-124147-0040_7078-271888-0100 AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
322-124147-0042_198-126831-0005 THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
322-124147-0043_2910-131096-0024 IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
322-124147-0044_4297-13006-0012 AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
322-124147-0046_7178-34644-0043 BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
322-124147-0047_118-47824-0044 HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE NOTICE OF HIS COUSINS FROM A CONVICTION THAT IF THEY SAW HIM DEPART THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO CONJECTURE HIS DESIGN
322-124147-0050_2182-150130-0029 IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
322-124147-0052_7067-76047-0042 WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
322-124147-0054_4397-15678-0015 AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
322-124147-0056_3983-5331-0024 AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
322-124147-0057_6415-100596-0007 HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
322-124147-0060_4051-11218-0053 WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
322-124147-0061_1235-135883-0017 WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
322-124147-0062_2952-410-0001 SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
322-124147-0065_3440-171009-0027 AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
322-124147-0070_5049-25947-0010 STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
322-124147-0071_6529-62554-0052 AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
322-124147-0072_8238-274553-0000 NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
322-124147-0074_200-124139-0005 RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
322-124147-0078_2289-152254-0024 SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
322-124147-0079_8419-293469-0010 AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
322-124147-0081_6925-80680-0052 I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
322-124147-0082_2416-152139-0038 THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
3235-11599-0000_103-1241-0009 CHAPTER TEN MEASURE NINETY SEVEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EYE A MEASURE IS THAT PORTION OF THE STAFF FOUND BETWEEN TWO BARS IN CERTAIN CASES THIS SPACE MAY BE LESS THAN A MEASURE
3235-11599-0004_1263-138246-0009 ONE OR MORE OF THESE BEATS BEING STRONGER THAN THE REST TWO CERTAIN RHYTHMIC FIGURES
3235-11599-0009_7302-86815-0053 IN SYNCOPATION THE NORMAL SYSTEM OF ACCENTING IS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED AND THE ACCENTED TONE FALLS ON THE REGULARLY UNACCENTED PART OF THE MEASURE SYNCOPATION MAY THEREFORE BE DEFINED AS THE TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION OF A NORMAL SERIES OF ACCENTS
3235-11599-0010_5703-47198-0055 AND COMPOUND A SIMPLE MEASURE IS ONE WHICH HAS BUT A SINGLE ACCENT
3235-11599-0011_2518-154825-0032 TWO BEAT MEASURE AND THREE BEAT MEASURE A COMPOUND MEASURE IS AS ITS NAME IMPLIES ONE MADE UP BY COMBINING TWO OR MORE SIMPLE MEASURES OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE IN SLOW TEMPO
3235-11599-0012_8324-286681-0018 INTO SEVERAL CONSTITUENT GROUPS THE PRINCIPAL COMPOUND MEASURES ARE FOUR BEAT AND SIX BEAT BOTH BEING REFERRED TO AS COMPOUND DUPLE MEASURES FIVE BEAT SEVEN BEAT NINE BEAT AND TWELVE BEAT MEASURES
3235-11599-0015_1246-135815-0002 AND THAT A COMPOUND MEASURE IS ONE IN WHICH EACH BEAT IS REPRESENTED BY A DOTTED NOTE WHOSE VALUE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS
3235-11599-0016_1034-121119-0023 THERE IS THUS SEEN TO BE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SIMPLE AND COMPOUND WHEN APPLIED IN THIS CONNECTION THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION AT ISSUE BEING WHETHER FOUR BEAT MEASURE IS AN INDIVIDUAL VARIETY
3235-11599-0017_6531-61334-0034 OR WHETHER IT IS A VARIETY COMPOUNDED OUT OF TWO BEAT MEASURES EITHER BY PLACING TWO OF THESE IN A GROUP OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE INTO A LARGER NUMBER OF BEATS AS IS OFTEN NECESSARY IN SLOW TEMPI
3235-11599-0019_2416-152137-0020 IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE BEATS THE FIRST ONE BEING ACCENTED THE SECOND AND THIRD UNACCENTED
3235-11599-0024_7402-59171-0029 BUT THESE ARE PRACTICALLY ALWAYS TAKEN AS THREE BEAT AND FOUR BEAT MEASURES RESPECTIVELY BEING EQUIVALENT TO THESE IF EACH GROUP OF THREE TONES IS THOUGHT OF AS A TRIPLET
3235-11599-0026_458-126290-0014 OR OF TWO AND THREE SOMETIMES A MIXTURE OF BOTH IN THE SAME COMPOSITION WHILE THE SEVEN BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN IN GROUPS OF FOUR AND THREE OR OF THREE AND FOUR
3235-11599-0027_150-126107-0020 BUT USAGE VARIES SOMEWHAT AND THE SECOND SIGN IS SOMETIMES USED TO INDICATE FOUR HALF MEASURE
3235-11599-0028_2136-5143-0036 BUT AN INCOMPLETE CIRCLE DIFFERENTIATING TWO BEAT IMPERFECT MEASURE FROM THREE BEAT PERFECT MEASURE
3235-28433-0001_8226-274371-0018 AN ENGLISH FAMILY CONSISTING OF THE MOTHER ONE SON AND A DAUGHTER WERE TO ACCOMPANY ME AND WE HAD SPENT WEEKS IN MAKING OUR PREPARATIONS WE WERE TAKING SUPPLIES OF CLOTHING FOOD
3235-28433-0005_887-123289-0004 WHEN I LAUGHINGLY CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE SHIP TO THE FACT THAT THAT DATE FELL UPON FRIDAY AND MANY PERSONS OBJECTED TO SAILING UPON THAT DAY HE POSTPONED THE STARTING OF THE SAINT PAUL TO MAY TWENTY SIXTH
3235-28433-0006_7505-258964-0000 AND WE LEFT THE DOCK ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AMID THE CHEERS AND HAND WAVING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE BIG BOAT OFF FOR NOME THE STEAMER WAS WELL FITTED OUT SPICK AND SPAN IN FRESH CARPETS AND PAINT
3235-28433-0007_7511-102420-0033 AND CROWDED TO THE UTMOST CAPACITY FOR COMFORT EVERY STATEROOM WAS FULL EACH SEAT AT THE TABLES OCCUPIED NOT A FOOT OF SPACE ABOVE OR BELOW DECKS WAS LEFT UNUSED BUT PROVISION WAS MADE FOR ALL
3235-28433-0010_7190-90543-0017 FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN OF THESE THIRTY FIVE WERE WOMEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHILD ON BOARD AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE BLACK EYED GIRL WITH HER ESKIMO MOTHER AND WHITE FATHER FROM GOLOVIN BAY
3235-28433-0011_198-126831-0045 WHOM I HAD SEEN AT SAINT MICHAEL SOME MONTHS BEFORE AND WHO WAS NOW GOING BACK TO HER NORTHERN HOME SHE WORE A SAILOR SUIT OF NAVY BLUE SERGE TRIMMED WITH WHITE BRAID AND WAS AS COY AND CUNNING AS EVER
3235-28433-0013_7278-91083-0030 A PACE WHICH MY ENGLISH FRIENDS AND OTHERS COULD NOT FOLLOW FOR THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLY ILL IN THE REGION OF THEIR DIGESTIVE APPARATUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS I SLEPT FOR HOURS EACH DAY AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE TRIP
3235-28433-0014_7402-90848-0018 DURING THE NINE DAYS SAIL FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO UNALASKA A DISTANCE OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILES I STUDIED WELL THE PASSENGERS WE HAD PREACHERS ON BOARD
3235-28433-0017_587-54108-0012 AND OCCUPYING THE NEXT STATEROOM TO MINE THE LAST NAMED WERE GOING TO START A RESTAURANT IN NOME AS THEY WERE SOCIABLE JOLLY AND GOOD SAILORS FOR THE MOST PART I ENJOYED THEIR SOCIETY THEY HAD ALL LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR YEARS
3235-28433-0018_2384-152900-0080 AND THOUGH NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER WERE FIRM FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING AND WERE UNITING THEIR LITTLE FORTUNES IN THE HOPE OF MAKING GREATER ONES THE YOUNG MISSIONARY WAS A FRIEND TO THE OTHER THREE
3235-28433-0019_163-122947-0089 AND I FOUND NO BETTER OR MORE CONGENIAL COMPANIONS ON BOARD THE SHIP THAN THESE FOUR HONEST HARD WORKING WOMEN SO FULL OF HOPE COURAGE AND GOOD SENSE AS WELL AS CHRISTIANITY
3235-28433-0021_150-132655-0003 AS THE SEQUEL WILL SHOW PERHAPS FOR YEARS TO COME NOT MANY DAYS HAD PASSED WHEN WE FOUND THAT WE HAD ON BOARD WHAT FEW STEAMERS CAN BOAST OF AND THAT WAS AN ORCHESTRA OF PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS AMONG THE WAITERS
3235-28433-0022_2989-138028-0036 THESE WERE MEN GOING WITH ALL THE OTHERS TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES IN THE NEW GOLD FIELDS WORKING THEIR PASSAGE AS WAITERS ON THE SHIP TO NOME WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LEAVE IT THREE EVENINGS IN THE WEEK THESE MUSICIANS
3235-28433-0024_1235-135883-0016 AND SHE SANG MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PASSENGERS WHEN SHE SANG ONE EVENING IN HER CLEAR SYMPATHETIC VOICE THE SELECTION
3235-28433-0025_4362-15663-0020 OH WHERE IS MY WANDERING BOY TONIGHT THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE IN THE ROOM AND THE MIND OF MANY A MAN WENT BACK TO HIS OLD HOME AND PRAYING MOTHER IN SOME FAR DISTANT STATE
3235-28433-0026_2989-138035-0048 MAKING HIM RESOLVE TO WRITE OFTENER TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT BE COMFORTED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WHEREABOUTS AND WELFARE THESE EVENINGS WERE SOMETIMES VARIED BY RECITATIONS FROM AN ELOCUTIONIST ON BOARD
3235-28433-0027_909-131041-0022 AND A PRACTISED CLOG DANCER EXCITED THE RISIBLES OF THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY USUALLY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER AT HIS EXHIBITION OF FLYING HEELS DAY AFTER DAY PASSED
3235-28433-0028_1447-17506-0002 THOSE WHO WERE CONTINUALLY SEASICK HAD DIVERSION ENOUGH IT WAS USELESS FOR US TO TELL THEM A PATHETIC TALE OF SOME ONE WHO AT SOME TIME HAD BEEN MORE ILL THAN THEY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
3235-28433-0031_6147-34605-0032 BUT ONLY RECEIVED BLACK LOOKS AS OUR REWARD WE THEN CONCLUDED THAT A DIET OF TEA COFFEE AND SOUP WAS EXACTLY SUCH A ONE AS THE FISHES WOULD RECOMMEND COULD THEY SPEAK
3235-28433-0032_441-128988-0015 THESE FAVORITE AND MUCH USED LIQUIDS KEEPING UP A CONTINUAL SWISHING IN ONE'S INTERIOR REGIONS AND CAUSING ONE TO TRUTHFULLY SPEAK OF THE SAME AS INFERNAL INSTEAD OF INTERNAL
3235-28433-0033_7635-105661-0046 BUT THEY WERE ALL TREE PHYSICAL AS WELL AS FREE MORAL AGENTS AND DECIDED THESE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES AT LAST WE ENTERED THE JAPAN CURRENT AND THE WEATHER WAS WARMER AND MORE ENJOYABLE
3235-28433-0034_125-121124-0056 ON MONDAY JUNE FOURTH WE SAW FROM THE DECK A FEW DRIFTING LOGS AND A QUANTITY OF SEAWEED AND THESE WITH THE PRESENCE OF GULLS AND GOONIES FLYING OVERHEAD CONVINCED US THAT WE WERE NEARING LAND
3235-28433-0035_7794-295955-0000 WE WERE NOT MISTAKEN AFTER EATING AN EXCELLENT SIX O'CLOCK DINNER WE WENT ABOVE TO FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN HIGH ROCKY CLIFFS WHICH LOOMED UP INTO MOUNTAINS NOT FAR DISTANT
3235-28433-0036_1926-147987-0018 AND WE KNEW WE WERE AGAIN AT THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AND IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF UNIMAK PASS AS WE DREW NEARER AND ENTERED THE HARBOR SO WELL LAND LOCKED THE SUN DIPPED LOW INTO YELLOW RED WESTERN WATERS
3235-28433-0037_7780-274562-0012 THEREBY CASTING LONG SHADOWS ASLANT OUR PATHWAY SO DELICATELY SHADED IN GREENS THE LITTLE HAMLET OF DUTCH HARBOR NESTLED COSILY AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH BORDERED THE BAY
3235-28433-0039_8770-295462-0009 BOTH GROUPS OF CRAFT WERE EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR THE ICE TO CLEAR FROM BEHRING SEA BEFORE PROCEEDING ON THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND WE COUNTED SIXTEEN SHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND SIZES THE MAJORITY OF THEM LARGE STEAMERS
3235-28433-0040_1992-141719-0050 ALL WERE LOADED WITH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT FOR NOME SCOUT BOATS HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE AND FIND IF POSSIBLE A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ICE FIELDS
3235-28433-0042_4813-248638-0017 AT UNALASKA WE SPENT FOUR DAYS TAKING ON FRESH WATER AND COAL DURING WHICH TIME PASSENGERS VISITED BACK AND FORTH FROM THE WAITING STEAMERS MANY PERSONS HAVING FRIENDS ON OTHER BOATS
3235-28433-0045_5104-33406-0039 WITH THE SERVICE OF THE SHIP'S MEN LEAVING UNALASKA THE SUN SHONE CLEAR AND COLD UPON THE MOUNTAINS WHERE IN PLACES THE SIDES LOOKED BLACK FROM THE LATE FIRES STARTED IN THE DEEP TUNDRA BY MISCREANTS
3235-28433-0046_8238-274553-0006 THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH SNOW DOWN DEEP GORGES DASHED MOUNTAIN WATERS OF MELTING SNOW AND ICE HURRYING TO LEAP OFF GULLIED AND ROCKY CLIFFS INTO THE SEA THEIR PROGRESS WAS NEVER IMPEDED
3235-28452-0000_2136-5147-0017 ON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JUNE I AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE ICE HAD DRIFTED OUT TO SEA IN THE NIGHT EIGHT DAYS AFTER MOLLIE AND I HAD TAKEN OUR TWELVE MILES TRIP ACROSS THE BAY AND RETURN
3235-28452-0001_7278-104730-0005 THEN CAME HARD RAIN AND WIND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BLEW THE ICE BACK INTO THE BAY FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE STEAMERS WAITING TO COME IN COULD NOT DO SO FOR FEAR OF THE DRIFTING FLOES
3235-28452-0002_909-131041-0028 BY THE THIRTIETH OF JUNE SCHOONERS WERE COMING INTO THE BAY WITH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT AND THE COAST STEAMERS ELMORE AND DORA HAD BEGUN TO MAKE REGULAR TRIPS TO AND FROM NOME WITH THEM CAME MAILS FROM THE OUTSIDE
3235-28452-0003_8629-261140-0005 WITH NEWSPAPERS AND TIDINGS OF FRIENDS IN THE STATES THEN OUR FINGERS TREMBLED AT OPENING OUR LETTERS UNTIL WE FOUND THAT ALL OUR DEAR ONES WERE WELL AND WE HEARTILY THANKED THE LORD
3235-28452-0004_3240-131231-0012 THERE WERE OTHER WHITE WOMEN IN CAMP BY THIS TIME AND MANY STRANGERS AT THE HOTEL AMONG OTHERS OFFICIALS AND THOSE IN AUTHORITY SINCE THE STONE THROWING EPISODE THE MARSHAL HAD BEEN DOING DUTY AS WATCHMAN
3235-28452-0005_211-122425-0029 SLEEPING DURING THE DAY AND GUARDING THE HOUSE NIGHTS THE HEAVY IRON BRACELETS IN HIS INNER COAT POCKET WEIGHING SCARCELY MORE THAN THE LOADED REVOLVER IN HIS BELT
3235-28452-0008_8630-305212-0014 THEY CAME FROM THE EAST WEST NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SORRY TO KNOW OF HER ILLNESS AND BRINGING PRESENTS WITH THEM SOMETIMES IT WAS A LITTLE LIVE BIRD OR SQUIRREL A DELICIOUS SALMON TROUT
3235-28452-0010_1867-154075-0019 THERE WERE TINY DISHES CHAIRS TABLES A HUNDRED THINGS DEAR TO A LITTLE GIRL'S HEART AND ALL PLEASED HER IMMENSELY BUT ALL WERE LAID QUICKLY ASIDE FOR A BASKET OF WILD FLOWERS OR MOSSES
3235-28452-0012_7178-34644-0027 AND YOUNG AS SHE IS AND HAVING SEEN THE GREAT CITY BY THE GOLDEN GATE WITH MANY OF ITS WONDERS SHE IS HAPPIEST IN CHINIK HERE LIVES HER DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER HER COUSINS AND AUNTS
3235-28452-0015_5322-7678-0035 A FEW REMAINED FOR THE SUMMER HERE MEN BUILT BOATS AND ROWED AWAY TO KEECHAWIK AND NEUKLUK CARRYING SUPPLIES FOR HUNTING OR PROSPECTING THE CAPTAIN'S VEGETABLE GARDEN IN THE SAND WAS GROWING RAPIDLY
3235-28452-0018_6367-65536-0041 FRESH MEATS AND VEGETABLES WE MADE UP FOR MANY MONTHS OF WINTER DIETING ALL THIS TIME I LONGED TO GET AWAY I WAS GOING EACH DAY TO THE HILL TOP TO WATCH FOR THE STEAMERS WHICH WOULD BRING THE LETTERS FOR WHICH I WAITED
3235-28452-0019_5163-18515-0012 AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH MY GOLD CLAIMS WERE WITH
3235-28452-0020_2289-152258-0020 ARRANGED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN I BOARDED THE STEAMER I WOULD CARRY WITH ME AT LEAST THREE DEEDS TO AS MANY CLAIMS WITH A FAIR PROSPECT OF OTHERS BUT I COULD NOT DECIDE TO REMAIN ANOTHER WINTER
3235-28452-0021_1502-122619-0011 I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO SAINT MICHAEL UP THE YUKON TO DAWSON AND OUTSIDE AND LAID MY PLANS ACCORDINGLY
3235-28452-0022_1116-137572-0039 THE LATTER NOW GROWN WILFUL BUT STILL SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY I WANTED TO TAKE BOTH WITH ME BUT NO I COULD NOT THE LITTLE GIRL'S WORK WAS NOT ENDED
3235-28452-0023_8051-295385-0019 AND SHE IS SURELY ABOUT TO FULFILL IT BORN AS SHE WAS IN A ROUGH MINING CAMP AT THE FOOT OF THE BARREN HILLS SHE WAS GIVEN THE ESKIMO NAME OF YAHKUK MEANING A LITTLE HILL
3235-28452-0024_696-92939-0008 AND SHE LIKE AN OASIS IN A DESERT PLACE IS LEFT HERE TO CHEER LOVE AND HELP OTHERS MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF THE SWEET AND GENTLE INFLUENCES GOING OUT FROM THE LIFE OF LITTLE YAHKUK
3235-28452-0026_8088-284756-0071 THEN HER BIG BLACK EYES GLANCE BRIGHTLY INTO BLUE ONES LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE FULL RED LIPS PART IN A CORDIAL SMILE WHILE THE ONE SOLITARY DIMPLE IN THE SMOOTH ROUND CHEEK
3235-28452-0027_4088-158077-0042 PRICKS ITS WAY STILL DEEPER AND SMALL ARMS GO UP AROUND HIS NECK WHEN THE MAN TURNS HIS FACE WEARS A SOFT AND TENDER EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE WERE LOOKING AT SOME BEAUTIFUL SIGHT FAR AWAY
3235-28452-0028_6385-34669-0012 AND PERHAPS HE IS GOD GRANT THAT THE SWEET MEMORY OF THAT LITTLE CHILD'S KISS MAY BE SO LASTING THAT ALL THEIR LIVES HE AND OTHERS MAY BE PURER AND BETTER MEN
3235-28452-0029_6531-61334-0006 WHEN AUGUST CAME I SAILED AWAY THE DORA HAD ENTERED THE BAY IN THE MORNING AND FOUND MY TRUNK PACKED AND WAITING IT WAS THEN ONLY THE WORK OF A LITTLE TIME TO MAKE READY TO LEAVE
3235-28452-0030_7511-102420-0000 TO MY GOOD MISSIONARY FRIENDS I HAD ALREADY SAID GOOD BYE AND THE CAPTAIN AND MOLLIE WERE KINDLY REGRETFUL WITH TEARS IN MY EYES BUT WITH REAL PAIN IN MY HEART I BADE JENNIE GOOD BYE
3235-28452-0031_7859-102518-0023 AND STEPPED INTO THE LITTLE BOAT WHICH WAS TO CARRY ME TO THE DORA FAREWELL THEN TO CHINIK THE HOME OF THE NORTH WIND AND BLIZZARD FAREWELL TO THE ICE FIELDS OF GOLOVIN
3235-28452-0032_6531-61334-0008 SO TARDY IN LEAVING IN SUMMER AND TO KEECHAWIK AND CHINIK WHOSE CLEAR RUSHING WATERS SO CHEERED US IN SPRING TIME FAREWELL TO THE MOSS COVERED HILLS AND PATHS THICKLY BORDERED WITH BLOSSOMS
3240-131231-0001_3947-13260-0001 WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0003_6181-216552-0069 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0005_1235-135887-0030 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006_3436-172171-0040 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007_1455-138263-0029 AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0010_307-127535-0014 TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0014_2518-154826-0048 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015_2989-138035-0035 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0020_669-129061-0023 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021_198-209-0022 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022_5456-62014-0002 IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0024_4397-15678-0025 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025_7447-91187-0030 FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026_481-123720-0079 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0029_2691-156745-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0031_696-93314-0018 THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0036_8098-278278-0026 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0038_460-172359-0085 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039_3486-166446-0015 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0046_8465-246942-0016 THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0048_696-93314-0011 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0050_5456-62043-0009 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051_1723-141149-0080 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE

3240-131231-0058_2436-2477-0021 IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0063_311-124404-0028 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0066_3830-12530-0008 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0068_3436-172162-0023 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069_8465-246942-0012 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070_5867-48852-0025 BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0073_3857-180923-0013 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0078_39-121914-0024 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079_6925-80680-0006 BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0081_2514-149482-0062 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082_322-124146-0016 THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083_2691-156755-0016 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0085_2843-152918-0095 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0004_6848-76049-0023 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006_32-4137-0019 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0009_8324-286682-0000 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010_125-121124-0003 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0013_1898-145724-0030 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0015_8770-295462-0029 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0020_2911-7601-0043 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021_5808-54425-0006 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022_5322-7678-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023_4788-294466-0016 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024_289-121652-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025_4680-16026-0037 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026_3112-9555-0067 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0028_5049-25947-0094 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029_8468-294887-0038 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0031_7367-86737-0016 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032_4813-248641-0052 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0034_39-121915-0023 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035_8226-274371-0033 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0037_19-198-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038_6531-61334-0110 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY

3242-67153-0000_5789-57158-0036 AND FINDS A FAIR MARGIN OF PROFIT IN SHOVING IT THERE'S A CHANCE FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED FROM LATIN TO POETRY IN THE PACKING BUSINESS THOUGH WE DON'T USE MUCH POETRY HERE EXCEPT IN OUR STREET CAR ADS
3242-67153-0002_4088-158077-0085 BUT I WANTED YOU TO FORM GOOD MENTAL HABITS JUST AS I WANT YOU TO HAVE CLEAN STRAIGHT PHYSICAL ONES BECAUSE I WAS RUN THROUGH A THRESHING MACHINE WHEN I WAS A BOY AND DIDN'T BEGIN TO GET THE STRAW OUT OF MY HAIR TILL I WAS PAST THIRTY
3242-67153-0003_1963-142393-0036 I HAVEN'T ANY SYMPATHY WITH A LOT OF THESE OLD FELLOWS WHO GO AROUND BRAGGING OF THEIR IGNORANCE AND SAYING THAT BOYS DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT ADDITION AND THE BEST POLICY BRAND OF HONESTY WE STARTED IN A MIGHTY DIFFERENT WORLD AND WE WERE ALL IGNORANT TOGETHER
3242-67153-0005_3879-174923-0010 AND THERE'RE JUST AS MANY CHANCES FOR A FELLOW AS EVER BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE GUN SHY AND YOU CAN'T CATCH THEM BY ANY SUCH COARSE METHOD AS PUTTING SALT ON THEIR TAILS THIRTY YEARS AGO YOU COULD TAKE AN OLD MUZZLE LOADER AND KNOCK OVER PLENTY OF DUCKS IN THE CITY LIMITS
3242-67153-0009_7859-102519-0041 MUST BE AS CLEAN AND SHARP AS A HOUND'S TOOTH OR SOME OTHER FELLOW'S SIMPLY GOING TO EAT HIM UP THE FIRST COLLEGE MAN I EVER HIRED WAS OLD JOHN DURHAM'S SON JIM THAT WAS A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THE HOUSE WAS A MUCH SMALLER AFFAIR
3242-67153-0014_3699-19401-0010 BESIDES I FELT THAT PERHAPS I HADN'T TREATED THE BOY JUST RIGHT AS I HAD DELIVERED QUITE A JAG OF THAT WHEAT TO HIS FATHER MYSELF HELLO JIM I CALLED DO YOU STILL WANT THAT JOB YES SIR HE ANSWERED QUICK AS LIGHTNING WELL
3242-67153-0019_4137-11702-0051 IT WAS JUST AS I THOUGHT JIM WAS LAZY BUT HE HAD PUT THE HOUSE IN THE WAY OF SAVING SO MUCH MONEY THAT I COULDN'T FIRE HIM SO I RAISED HIS SALARY AND MADE HIM AN ASSISTANT TIMEKEEPER AND CHECKER
3242-67153-0020_3374-298032-0019 JIM KEPT AT THIS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS UNTIL HIS FEET BEGAN TO HURT HIM I GUESS AND THEN HE WAS OUT OF A JOB AGAIN IT SEEMS HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF A NEW MACHINE FOR REGISTERING THE MEN THAT DID AWAY WITH MOST OF THE TIMEKEEPERS EXCEPT THE FELLOWS WHO WATCHED THE MACHINES
3242-67153-0022_8226-274369-0040 I WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN JIM SO I BROUGHT HIM UP INTO THE OFFICE AND SET HIM TO COPYING CIRCULAR LETTERS WE USED TO SEND OUT A RAFT OF THEM TO THE TRADE THAT WAS JUST BEFORE THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF TYPEWRITERS WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE
3242-67153-0023_311-124404-0052 BUT JIM HADN'T BEEN IN THE OFFICE PLUGGING AWAY AT THE LETTERS FOR A MONTH BEFORE HE HAD THE WRITER'S CRAMP AND BEGAN NOSING AROUND AGAIN THE FIRST THING I KNEW HE WAS SICKING THE AGENTS FOR THE NEW TYPEWRITING MACHINE ON TO ME
3242-67153-0024_1963-142393-0029 AND HE KEPT THEM POUNDING AWAY UNTIL THEY HAD MADE ME GIVE THEM A TRIAL THEN IT WAS ALL UP WITH MISTER JIM'S JOB AGAIN
3242-67153-0027_2002-139469-0006 AT LAST HE HAD GOT INTO SOMETHING THAT HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN SPENDING MONEY AND HE JUST FAIRLY WALLOWED IN IT USED TO LAY AWAKE NIGHTS THINKING UP NEW WAYS OF GETTING RID OF THE OLD MAN'S PROFITS
3242-67153-0029_1183-133256-0014 JIM WOULD SEND HIM A CASE OF EXTRACT AND THEN ADVERTISE THAT IT WAS THE GREAT HEAT MAKER FOR COLD CLIMATES AND IF SOME OTHER FELLOW STARTED ACROSS AFRICA HE SENT HIM A CASE TOO AND ADVERTISED WHAT A BULLY DRINK IT WAS SERVED UP WITH A LITTLE ICE
3242-67153-0035_5678-43302-0013 I SEE YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF YOUR CLASS I'M GLAD THE BOYS AREN'T DOWN ON YOU BUT WHILE THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN HIS CLASS ISN'T ALWAYS A FAILURE IN BUSINESS BEING AS POPULAR AS THAT TAKES UP A HEAP OF TIME
3242-67153-0037_7517-100437-0013 I SIMPLY MENTION THIS IN PASSING I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ULTIMATE GOOD SENSE AND I GUESS YOU'LL SEE THE POINT WITHOUT MY ELABORATING WITH A MEAT AX MY REASONS FOR THINKING THAT YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH COLLEGE FOR THE PRESENT
3242-67168-0003_5104-33407-0010 ABUSE AND FLATTERY THE FIRST CAN'T HARM YOU AND THE SECOND CAN'T HELP YOU SOME MEN ARE LIKE YELLOW DOGS
3242-67168-0004_7264-92314-0021 LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS BULLING THE MARKET THE LONGS ALL SAID THAT I WAS A KIND HEARTED OLD PHILANTHROPIST WHO WAS LAYING AWAKE NIGHTS SCHEMING TO GET THE FARMERS A TOP PRICE FOR THEIR HOGS
3242-67168-0005_1898-145715-0023 AND THE SHORTS ALLOWED THAT I WAS AN INFAMOUS OLD ROBBER WHO WAS STEALING THE PORK OUT OF THE WORKINGMAN'S POT AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T PLEASE BOTH SIDES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PLEASING YOUR OWN SIDE
3242-67168-0006_1116-132847-0040 I REMEMBER ONCE I HAD A VACANT LOT OUT ON THE AVENUE AND A LADY CAME IN TO MY OFFICE AND IN A SOOTHING SYRUPY WAY ASKED IF I WOULD LEND IT TO HER AS SHE WANTED TO BUILD A CRECHE ON IT I HESITATED A LITTLE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF A CRECHE BEFORE
3242-67168-0008_7226-86964-0050 OF COURSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT TO GET OUR PASTOR OR THE POLICE AFTER ME SO I TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD SHE WENT OFF HAPPY BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER SHE DROPPED IN AGAIN LOOKING SORT OF DISSATISFIED TO FIND OUT IF I WOULDN'T BUILD THE CRECHE ITSELF
3242-67168-0013_8468-295198-0031 WENT ALL AROUND TOWN SAYING THAT I HAD GIVEN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SHED TO CHARITY AND PAINTED A THOUSAND DOLLAR AD ON IT ALLOWED I OUGHT TO SEND MY CHECK FOR THAT AMOUNT TO THE CRECHE FUND KEPT AT IT TILL I BEGAN TO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT AFTER ALL AND SENT HER THE MONEY
3242-67168-0015_26-495-0066 BUT THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER PUT INTO IT WHICH DIDN'T DRAW DIVIDENDS IN FUN OR DOLLARS WAS WORRY THAT IS A BRANCH OF THE TRADE WHICH YOU WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR COMPETITORS I'VE ALWAYS FOUND WORRYING A BLAMED SIGHT MORE UNCERTAIN THAN HORSE RACING IT'S HARDER TO PICK A WINNER AT IT
3242-67168-0016_60-121082-0055 YOU GO HOME WORRYING BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR FOOL NEW CLERK FORGOT TO LOCK THE SAFE AFTER YOU AND DURING THE NIGHT THE LARD REFINERY BURNS DOWN YOU SPEND A YEAR FRETTING BECAUSE YOU THINK BILL JONES IS GOING TO CUT YOU OUT WITH YOUR BEST GIRL AND THEN YOU SPEND TEN WORRYING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
3242-67168-0019_3112-9555-0019 AND THEN SHE'D SHED ALL WORRY OVER THEM FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALLOWED THAT IF THEY GOT HURT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BRING THEM HOME
3242-67168-0022_3486-166424-0063 HINTED THAT THERE'D BE NO FUNERAL OR SUCH LIKE EXPENSIVE GOINGS ON UNTIL SOME ONE PRODUCED THE DECEASED TAKE HER BY AND LARGE SHE WAS A PRETTY COOL CALM CUCUMBER
3242-67168-0026_6019-3185-0021 WELL THE WIDOW SAID SHE RECKONED THAT BOYS OUGHT TO BE LET OUT AS WELL AS IN FOR HALF PRICE AND SO SHE LAID DOWN TWO BITS ALLOWING THAT SHE WANTED A FEW MINUTES PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER BUD
3242-67168-0027_289-121652-0021 CLYTIE SAID SHE'D DO HER BEST BUT THAT SPIRITS WERE MIGHTY SNIFTY AND HIGH TONED EVEN WHEN THEY'D ONLY BEEN POOR WHITE TRASH ON EARTH AND IT MIGHT MAKE THEM MAD TO BE CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR HIGH JINKS IF THEY WERE TAKING A LITTLE RECREATION OR FROM THEIR HIGH PRICED NEW YORK CUSTOMERS IF THEY WERE WORKING
3242-67168-0028_1970-10594-0009 BUT NEXT DAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND PAID DOWN FOUR BITS AND CLYTIE RECKONED THAT THAT OUGHT TO FETCH BUD SURE SOMEWAYS THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LUCK AND FINALLY THE WIDOW SUGGESTED THAT SHE CALL UP BUD'S FATHER BUCK WILLIAMS HAD BEEN DEAD A MATTER OF TEN YEARS
3242-67168-0031_27-124992-0059 BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A WHISPER EVEN FROM BUD I RECKON CLYTIE HAD BEEN STRINGING THE OLD LADY ALONG INTENDING TO PRODUCE BUD'S SPOOK AS A SORT OF RED FIRE CALCIUM LIGHT GRAND MARCH OF THE AMAZONS CLIMAX BUT SHE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
3242-67168-0038_458-126294-0008 BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
3242-8112-0000_3699-47246-0028 MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
3242-8112-0001_6019-3185-0070 EIGHT TONS OF HIS LAB EQUIPMENT PLUS HIS SPECIAL U LEAGUE GUARDS OH TRIGGER PICKED UP THE PUYA GLASS SHE LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS EMPTY MOVING WHERE SHE ASKED MANON SAID THE COMMISSIONER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER
3242-8112-0002_250-142276-0031 EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
3242-8112-0003_8468-286673-0036 THEN SHE SMILED AT QUILLAN MAJOR SHE SAID HOW ABOUT A TINY LITTLE REFILL ON THAT PUYA ABOUT HALF QUILLAN TOOK CARE OF THE TINY LITTLE REFILL COMMISSIONER TATE SAID BY THE WAY
3242-8112-0005_307-127535-0019 AND NOW SAID THE COMMISSIONER WE'LL TALK MORE FREELY WE TELL MANTELISH JUST AS LITTLE AS WE CAN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH TRIGGER THE PROFESSOR IS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP ON AN OPERATION LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S YES SHE SAID
3242-8112-0006_4640-19188-0024 GOING OVER FOR VISITS TO MANTELISH'S GARDEN WITH MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I REMEMBER I CAN IMAGINE HE'S A PROBLEM SHE SHIFTED HER GAZE CURIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
3242-8112-0007_6415-100596-0006 LOOKING FOR GESS FAYLE AND THE KEY UNIT HOLATI TATE SAID THAT'S ABOUT IT WE'RE ONE OF A FEW THOUSAND FEDERATION GROUPS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME GENERAL JOB EACH GROUP WORKS AT ITS SPECIALTIES AND THE INFORMATION GETS CORRELATED
3242-8112-0008_2843-152918-0034 IN WHAT WAY TRIGGER ASKED WELL SUPPOSE THAT KEY UNIT IS LOST AND STAYS LOST SUPPOSE ALL THE OTHER PLASMOIDS PUT TOGETHER DON'T CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SHOW HOW THE OLD GALACTICS PRODUCED THE THINGS AND GOT THEM TO OPERATE
3242-8112-0012_89-218-0004 AND THE NUMBER OF PLANETARY CONFEDERACIES SUBPLANETARY GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRIAL FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL COMBINES ASSORTED POWER GROUPS ET CETERA AND SO ON IS SOMETHING I'D HATE TO HAVE TO CALCULATE WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE ASKED
3242-8112-0013_87-121553-0065 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0014_2691-156755-0002 OF COURSE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET VERY UNHAPPY EH THAT SAID COMMISSIONER TATE IS ONLY A LITTLE OF IT YES THE THING ISN'T JUST LOST SOMEBODY'S GOT IT VERY LIKELY TRIGGER NODDED
3242-8112-0015_8797-294123-0044 SO ANY ONE OF UMPTEEN THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE HUB MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT HAS THAT PLASMOID NOW INCLUDING SAID HOLATI ANY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RESTRICTED WORLDS

3259-158083-0000_3242-67153-0030 ADMINISTRATION TERRORISM THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED IN ANOTHER WAY TO STOP PICKETING
3259-158083-0001_6476-96661-0016 THE AGITATION WOULD CERTAINLY WEAKEN SO THOUGHT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE HOWEVER IN THE FACE OF THAT RECKLESS AND EXTREME SENTENCE THE LONGEST PICKET LINE OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN FORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TENTH

3259-158083-0018_6209-34599-0024 FORTY ONE WOMEN REPRESENTING SIXTEEN STATES IN THE UNION MIGHT CREATE A CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL DISLOCATION BUT THESE SAME FORTY ONE WOMEN WERE DETERMINED TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ITS CHOICE IT COULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR PEACEFUL AGITATION
3259-158083-0019_2159-179157-0029 OR IT COULD STAND THE REACTION WHICH WAS BOUND TO COME FROM IMPRISONING THEM AND SO THE FORTY ONE WOMEN RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES TO RESUME THEIR PICKETING THEY STOOD GUARD SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE TAKEN UNAWARES COULD SUMMON SUFFICIENT FORCE TO ARREST THEM

3259-158083-0101_1263-138246-0002 INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
3259-158083-0104_5652-39938-0066 THE AFFIDAVIT THEN CONTINUES WITH THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS BRANNAN WAS COMPELLED THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WAS GIVEN A CUP OF SKIMMED MILK AND A SLICE OF TOAST
3259-158083-0105_6000-55211-0059 AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO LIE DOWN FEELING SO ILL I COULD NOT SLEEP HAVING A SENSE OF CONSTANT DANGER I WAS ALMOST PARALYZED AND IN WRETCHED PHYSICAL CONDITION

3259-158083-0108_1553-140047-0018 AND THIS WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE SEWING ROOM THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON OUR NERVES CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED EVERY CONCEIVABLE LIE WAS TRIED IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE WOMEN TO ABANDON THEIR VARIOUS FORM OF RESISTANCE
3259-158083-0109_2764-36619-0022 THEY WERE TOLD THAT NO EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO REACH THEM AND THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD BEEN CALLED OFF THE CASE EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HUNGER STRIKING EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE OTHERS HAD PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES AND WERE WORKING
3259-158083-0110_4441-76263-0041 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SUSPECTED THE LIES AND REMAINED STRONG IN THEIR RESISTANCE AFTER MISTER O'BRIEN'S ONE VISIT AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS THEREAFTER REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE WORKHOUSE
3259-158083-0111_4362-15663-0106 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP THIS GROUP AWAY FROM ALICE PAUL AND HER COMPANIONS AS THEY COUNTED ON HANDLING THE REBELLION MORE EASILY IN TWO GROUPS THAN ONE MEANWHILE THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS IN THE WORKHOUSE GREW STEADILY WORSE
3259-158083-0113_8425-287387-0006 IT COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE PRISONERS INTO COURT AND SHOW CAUSE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL THIS CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN JUDGE SAID OF THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT
3259-158083-0115_6078-54013-0067 A DETECTIVE SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ACCOMPANY MISTER O'BRIEN FROM WASHINGTON TO NORFOLK DURING HIS STAY IN NORFOLK AND BACK TO WASHINGTON TELEPHONE WIRES AT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE TAPPED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS COGNIZANT OF EVERY MOVE IN THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED
3259-158083-0116_3947-13262-0034 NO SOONER WAS OUR PLAN DECIDED UPON THAN FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BESOUGHT US TO ABANDON THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENT AN EMISSARY TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WITH THE FOLLOWING APPEAL
3259-158083-0117_298-126791-0000 IF YOU WILL ONLY DROP THESE PROCEEDINGS I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE PRISONERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE WORKHOUSE TO THE JAIL IN A WEEK IN A WEEK THEY MAY BE DEAD BY THAT TIME WE ANSWERED WE CANNOT WAIT
3259-158083-0118_5390-24512-0023 AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
328-129766-0004_5778-12761-0015 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0012_6925-80680-0037 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0020_4853-29413-0026 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021_6563-63821-0027 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0027_5456-62043-0037 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028_3857-180923-0002 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029_3242-8112-0037 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030_5808-48608-0022 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0032_4051-11218-0051 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0034_311-124404-0070 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035_8098-278252-0033 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0038_441-130108-0025 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0040_696-93314-0020 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0047_6078-54007-0003 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0049_200-126784-0003 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050_1088-129236-0003 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0053_3723-171631-0010 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE

328-129766-0055_2910-131096-0082 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0057_1502-122619-0091 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058_5808-48608-0007 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059_254-145458-0021 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060_460-172357-0017 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061_2764-36616-0035 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0065_150-126112-0017 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066_3879-174923-0043 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067_5789-57195-0024 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0069_2391-145015-0049 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0071_4406-16882-0038 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072_87-121553-0081 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073_8975-270782-0083 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0075_4788-91208-0001 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0077_2182-150130-0034 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0084_5339-14134-0064 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085_4267-78186-0001 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086_125-121124-0029 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0088_2092-145706-0000 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0091_1246-124548-0000 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092_1040-133433-0004 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093_1867-148436-0030 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0095_1970-26100-0003 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0098_1578-140045-0003 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
332-128985-0000_1088-134315-0032 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001_8088-284756-0010 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0002_89-218-0007 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0003_6531-61334-0072 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004_118-124588-0018 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0005_6476-57446-0007 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0006_7859-102519-0007 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007_5652-39938-0054 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0008_1098-133695-0006 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
332-128985-0012_8312-279791-0022 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013_89-218-0056 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0014_7302-86815-0002 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0018_6064-56168-0027 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019_32-21625-0009 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0020_1926-143879-0041 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
332-128985-0021_8312-279790-0030 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0023_1992-141719-0044 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0027_26-495-0081 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028_2989-138028-0054 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0029_3879-174923-0049 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0030_4397-15666-0020 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031_426-122822-0014 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0035_118-47824-0055 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0036_4014-186179-0035 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037_7148-59157-0005 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038_4680-16041-0001 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039_4267-72637-0015 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0041_201-127786-0067 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
332-128985-0043_8226-274369-0028 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0046_5456-62014-0009 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0050_8747-293952-0032 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0055_5789-57195-0018 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0059_2843-152918-0079 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
332-128985-0060_6385-34669-0017 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061_6848-252323-0011 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0064_6836-76549-0027 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0068_1183-133255-0003 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0070_8609-262281-0034 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0071_3526-176651-0012 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
332-128985-0073_6529-62556-0007 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0077_426-122822-0009 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0079_201-127786-0017 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0082_7367-86737-0110 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0087_226-131532-0021 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088_233-134440-0041 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
3374-298025-0001_150-132655-0022 BUT WHAT SHALL MY SPIRIT BESTOW UPON ITS OFFSPRING WHICH LIKE ITS PARENT IS AS POOR IN POESY AS IT IS RICH IN LOVE JUST ONE WORD A PARTING TROPE
3374-298025-0004_328-129766-0015 A FRESH WARM BREATH OF LIFE AND LOVE FANNED ME RUSTLING AND STIRRING IN ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE VERDANT GROVE I GAZED AND ENJOYED IT ALL THE RICH GREEN THE WHITE BLOSSOMS AND THE GOLDEN FRUIT
3374-298025-0006_1867-154071-0029 AND NOW AS A DIGNIFIED MOTHER WITH HER DEMURE BABE IN HER ARMS I BREATHED THE SPRING AND I SAW CLEARLY ALL ABOUT ME EVERLASTING YOUTH SMILING I SAID TO MYSELF
3374-298025-0008_1992-141719-0009 BUT I GLADLY LOST MYSELF IN ALL THOSE BLENDINGS AND INTERTWININGS OF JOY AND PAIN FROM WHICH SPRING THE SPICE OF LIFE AND THE FLOWER OF FEELING SPIRITUAL PLEASURE AS WELL AS SENSUAL BLISS
3374-298025-0014_374-180298-0029 NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW HOW LONG I DO NOT KNOW FOR ALONG WITH THE OTHER RULES OF REASON AND MORALITY I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE LAPSE OF TIME WELL I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT INTO THE OPEN
3374-298025-0015_1723-141149-0075 THE MORNING CERTAINLY DESERVES TO BE CALLED BEAUTIFUL THE AIR IS STILL AND QUITE WARM AND THE VERDURE HERE BEFORE ME IS FRESH AND EVEN AS THE WIDE LAND UNDULATES IN HILLS AND DALES
3374-298025-0017_2836-5354-0036 MY VISION DOUBTLESS OWES THE GROVE AND ITS SOUTHERN COLOR EFFECT TO THE HUGE MASS OF FLOWERS HERE BESIDE ME
3374-298025-0019_1455-134435-0053 ALL EXCEPT THAT NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND DOING NOTHING AND THAT I AM NOW SITTING HERE AND DOING SOMETHING SOMETHING WHICH IS PERHAPS LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING PERHAPS EVEN LESS
3374-298025-0021_7302-86814-0026 IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL LAWS THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT ATTACK THE HIDDEN CENTRE OF THE LOVELIEST EXISTENCE AND TO CONFESS TO YOU THE MANIFOLD EFFECTS OF MY AWKWARDNESS
3374-298025-0023_3259-158083-0094 A PERIOD WHICH TAKEN AS A WHOLE OR IN PARTS I CAN NEVER LOOK BACK UPON WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF INWARD AMUSEMENT A LITTLE MELANCHOLY AND CONSIDERABLE SELF SATISFACTION
3374-298025-0026_3486-166424-0000 FRANKLY CLAIMING AND ASSERTING THE RIGHT TO A CHARMING CONFUSION THIS IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL WHICH OUR LIFE AND LOVE OFFERS TO MY SPIRIT AND TO MY PEN IS SO INCESSANTLY PROGRESSIVE
3374-298025-0027_6415-100596-0003 AND SO INFLEXIBLY SYSTEMATIC IF THE FORM WERE ALSO OF THAT CHARACTER THIS IN ITS WAY UNIQUE LETTER WOULD THEN ACQUIRE AN INTOLERABLE UNITY AND MONOTONY
3374-298025-0029_7859-102518-0007 IT WAS WRITTEN IN A MOOD OF IMPATIENT LONGING DUE TO MY NOT FINDING YOU WHERE I MOST SURELY EXPECTED TO FIND YOU IN YOUR ROOM ON OUR SOFA IN THE HAPHAZARD WORDS SUGGESTED BY THE PEN YOU HAD LATELY BEEN USING
3374-298025-0030_2836-5355-0032 THE SELECTION IS NOT DIFFICULT FOR SINCE AMONG THE DREAMY FANCIES WHICH ARE HERE CONFIDED TO YOU IN PERMANENT LETTERS THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD
3374-298025-0031_211-122425-0041 IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND HAS A CERTAIN SORT OF RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT THEY CALL THOUGHT I CHOOSE IN PREFERENCE TO ANYTHING ELSE A DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE MOST LOVELY OF SITUATIONS
3374-298025-0032_1898-145724-0018 FOR ONCE WE KNOW TO A CERTAINTY THAT WE LIVE IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD THE NEXT NEED IS OBVIOUS
3374-298026-0000_839-130898-0099 IT LOOKS AT ME JOYOUSLY OUT OF ITS DEEP EYES AND OPENS ITS ARMS TO EMBRACE MY SPIRIT
3374-298026-0004_6529-62554-0031 EACH IDEA DEVELOPS A COUNTLESS PROGENY
3374-298026-0005_6064-56168-0017 I REMEMBER EVERYTHING EVEN THE GRIEFS AND ALL MY THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE TO BE
3374-298026-0009_2002-139469-0012 OH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL A FAIRY TALE THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH JOY SUCH LOVE AS I NOW FEEL AND SUCH A WOMAN WHO COULD BE MY MOST TENDER BELOVED MY BEST COMPANION AND AT THE SAME TIME
3374-298026-0010_3982-178459-0001 A PERFECT FRIEND FOR IT WAS IN FRIENDSHIP ESPECIALLY THAT I SOUGHT FOR WHAT I WANTED AND FOR WHAT I NEVER HOPED TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN IN YOU I FOUND IT ALL AND MORE THAN I COULD WISH FOR
3374-298026-0012_5104-33407-0021 YOU RECOGNIZE NO SEPARATIONS YOUR BEING IS AN INDIVISIBLE UNITY THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO SERIOUS AND SO JOYOUS WHY YOU REGARD EVERYTHING IN SUCH A LARGE AND INDIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0013_3242-67153-0033 THAT IS WHY YOU LOVE ME ALL OF ME AND WILL SURRENDER NO PART OF ME TO THE STATE TO POSTERITY OR TO MANLY PLEASURES I AM ALL YOURS WE ARE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER
3374-298026-0015_32-21631-0008 AND TRUE FEMININE HUMILITY THE MOST EXTREME SUFFERING IF IT IS ONLY SURROUNDED WITHOUT SEPARATING US
3374-298026-0019_2002-139469-0063 AND SO I SAY AGAIN LET US LIVE AND LOVE I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SURVIVE ME YOU WOULD RATHER FOLLOW YOUR DYING HUSBAND INTO HIS COFFIN GLADLY AND LOVINGLY WOULD YOU DESCEND INTO THE BURNING ABYSS
3374-298026-0022_5192-19397-0048 SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF AS SINGLE AND INDIVISIBLE AS A PERSON ONE THING CROWDS OUT ANOTHER AND THAT WHICH JUST NOW WAS NEAR AND PRESENT SOON SINKS BACK INTO OBSCURITY
3374-298026-0025_6531-61334-0111 I THINK IN A LARGE WAY THAT WHICH WE CALL A LIFE IS FOR THE COMPLETE INNER IMMORTAL MAN ONLY A SINGLE IDEA AN INDIVISIBLE FEELING
3374-298026-0026_441-128982-0028 AND FOR HIM THERE COME TOO MOMENTS OF THE PROFOUNDEST AND FULLEST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN ALL LIVES FALL TOGETHER AND MINGLE AND SEPARATE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0027_7148-59157-0013 THE TIME IS COMING WHEN WE TWO SHALL BEHOLD IN ONE SPIRIT THAT WE ARE BLOSSOMS OF ONE PLANT OR PETALS OF ONE FLOWER WE SHALL THEN KNOW WITH A SMILE
3374-298026-0028_1246-124548-0051 THAT WHAT WE NOW CALL MERELY HOPE WAS REALLY MEMORY DO YOU KNOW HOW THE FIRST SEED OF THIS IDEA GERMINATED IN MY SOUL BEFORE YOU AND TOOK ROOT IN YOURS
3374-298026-0029_7859-102521-0010 WEAVE OUR LOVE EVER AND EVER MORE CLOSELY AND FIRMLY TOGETHER JUST AS A CHILD LIKE AN ECHO DOUBLES THE HAPPINESS OF ITS GENTLE PARENTS NOTHING CAN PART US
3374-298026-0030_322-124147-0000 AND CERTAINLY ANY SEPARATION WOULD ONLY DRAW ME MORE POWERFULLY TO YOU I BETHINK ME HOW AT OUR LAST EMBRACE YOU VEHEMENTLY RESISTING I BURST INTO SIMULTANEOUS TEARS AND LAUGHTER
3374-298026-0031_8051-119902-0023 I TRIED TO CALM MYSELF AND IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS SEPARATED FROM YOU UNTIL THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS CONVINCED ME OF IT AGAINST MY WILL
3374-298026-0033_4340-15220-0040 THE POIGNANT GRIEF WOULD BE TRANSIENT AND QUICKLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO COMPLETE HARMONY HOW COULD SEPARATION SEPARATE US WHEN PRESENCE ITSELF IS TO US AS IT WERE TOO PRESENT
3374-298026-0035_4195-17507-0002 IT IS NOT MERELY THE DELIGHT OF EXHAUSTION OR THE ANTICIPATION OF REVENGE I SEE IN IT A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUNDLY SIGNIFICANT ALLEGORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND WOMAN
3374-298026-0037_5339-14134-0051 AND HOW YOU TOOK IT AT THAT TIME AND I THINK I KNOW JUST AS WELL WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF IT AND HOW YOU WILL TAKE IT HERE HERE IN THIS LITTLE BOOK IN WHICH YOU EXPECT TO FIND GENUINE HISTORY PLAIN TRUTH AND CALM REASON
3374-298026-0039_3664-11714-0007 HOW CAN A MAN WISH TO WRITE ANYTHING WHICH IT IS SCARCELY PERMISSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE FELT
3374-298026-0041_6836-61804-0006 A MAN FEELS IT HE MUST WISH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WHAT A MAN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT HE MAY WRITE
3374-298026-0043_4406-16883-0039 AND SOMETIMES FALLS HEADLONG OVER ITS OWN HONEST ZEAL AND SPEAKS A WORD THAT IS DIVINE TO THE POINT OF COARSENESS THIS APOLOGY WOULD INDEED SAVE ME
3374-298026-0044_6209-34599-0012 BUT PERHAPS ONLY AT THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE OF MY MANHOOD ITSELF FOR WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MY MANHOOD IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE NEVERTHELESS A GREAT DEAL AGAINST THE SEX IN GENERAL
3374-298026-0046_6064-300880-0007 SINCE SHE TOO IS A LADY WHOM I LOVE MOST TENDERLY
3374-298032-0000_1737-142397-0007 THE CHILDREN ARE JUSTIFIED WHEN THEY PEEP SO CURIOUSLY AND TIMIDLY AT A COMPANY OF UNKNOWN FACES EACH INDIVIDUAL ATOM OF EVERLASTING TIME IS CAPABLE OF COMPRISING A WORLD OF JOY
3374-298032-0004_445-123860-0000 EVERY LITTLE DETAIL SHE WROTE ABOUT YOUR SICKNESS TAKEN WITH WHAT I HAD ALREADY GLEANED FROM THE DOCTOR AND HAD OBSERVED MYSELF CONFIRMED MY SUSPICION THAT IT WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN YOU THOUGHT
3374-298032-0005_1116-132851-0001 INDEED NO LONGER DANGEROUS BUT DECIDED PAST HOPE LOST IN THIS THOUGHT AND MY STRENGTH ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HURRYING TO YOUR SIDE
3374-298032-0006_7226-86965-0017 MY STATE OF MIND WAS REALLY VERY DISCONSOLATE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY WAS BEING NEW BORN BY THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT YOU ARE WELL AGAIN
3374-298032-0007_5514-19192-0007 I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
3374-298032-0008_1841-150351-0006 FLOWERS HAD STARTED TO GROW ON THE BELOVED GRAVE AND MY TEARS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FLOW MORE GENTLY MUTE AND ALONE I STOOD AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FEATURES I HAD LOVED AND THE SWEET GLANCES OF THE EXPRESSIVE EYES
3374-298032-0010_5456-24741-0019 WITH UNBELIEVABLE RAPIDITY THE OUTLINES CHANGED REASSUMED THEIR FIRST FORM AND TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THE WILD VISION VANISHED
3374-298032-0011_2391-145015-0093 ONLY YOUR HOLY EYES REMAINED IN THE EMPTY SPACE AND HUNG THERE MOTIONLESS EVEN AS THE FRIENDLY STARS SHINE ETERNALLY OVER OUR POVERTY
3374-298032-0012_587-41619-0026 NOW A PIERCING PAIN FROM DARK SUNS BURNED ME WITH AN INSUPPORTABLE GLARE NOW A BEAUTIFUL RADIANCE HOVERED ABOUT AS IF TO ENTICE ME THEN I SEEMED TO FEEL A FRESH BREATH OF MORNING AIR FAN ME
3374-298032-0014_2159-179157-0004 WHY SHOULD YOU TORMENT YOURSELF IN A FEW MINUTES YOU CAN BE WITH HER
3374-298032-0015_6818-68772-0004 I WAS ALREADY HASTENING TO YOU WHEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT HELD ME BACK AND I SAID TO MY SPIRIT
3374-298032-0017_1363-139304-0005 AND THEN PRESENT YOURSELF AGAIN WHEN YOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
3374-298032-0018_8770-295465-0036 IS IT NOT TO YOU ALSO REMARKABLE HOW EVERYTHING ON THIS EARTH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTRE HOW ORDERLY EVERYTHING IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT AND TRIVIAL SO IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME
3374-298032-0025_26-495-0008 AND THE LOVELY FORMS OF REFINED CULTURE SEEMED DEAD AND TRIVIAL TO ME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS MONSTROUS WORLD OF INFINITE STRENGTH AND OF UNENDING STRUGGLE AND WARFARE
3374-298032-0028_5808-48608-0049 THIS FEELING ALSO CLUNG TO ME AND COMPLETELY SEPARATED ME FROM OTHER MEN JUST AS I WAS SUNDERED FROM THE EARTH BY THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR NATURE AND MY LOVE HAD BEEN TOO SACRED
3374-298032-0029_909-131045-0011 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL WAS RIGHT SO AND THAT YOUR UNAVOIDABLE DEATH WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A GENTLE AWAKENING AFTER A LIGHT SLEEP I TOO THOUGHT THAT I WAS AWAKE WHEN I SAW YOUR PICTURE
3374-298032-0032_298-126790-0021 BECAUSE EVERY EARTHLY SENTIMENT WAS ENTIRELY STRANGE TO ME AND THE FEELING NEVER LEFT ME THAT I WAS CONSECRATED TO DEATH
3374-298032-0036_7148-59157-0000 FINALLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY OVER THE BROW WAS NO LONGER SMOOTH AND THE LOCKS WERE BECOMING GRAY MY CAREER WAS ENDED BUT NOT COMPLETED
3374-298032-0037_4340-15220-0096 THE BEST STRENGTH OF LIFE WAS GONE AND STILL ART AND VIRTUE
3374-298032-0039_5390-24512-0012 THEN YOU APPEARED TO ME BECKONING WITH THE SUMMONS OF DEATH
3374-298032-0041_3607-135982-0012 AND ONLY IN THAT WAY DOES A HUMAN BEING BECOME ONE AND A COMPLETE ENTITY THAT IS BY REGARDING AND POETICALLY CONCEIVING HIMSELF AS THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
3436-172162-0000_7859-102518-0018 THE ADVENTURE OF THE CART IT BEFELL IN THE MONTH OF MAY QUEEN GUENEVER CALLED TO HER KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND AND GAVE THEM WARNING THAT EARLY UPON THE MORROW SHE WOULD RIDE A MAYING INTO THE WOODS AND FIELDS BESIDE WESTMINSTER

3664-11714-0000_3983-5331-0010 HE HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT THE DRAUGHTS CONTAINING DISSOLVED PEARLS WHICH THE QUACK DOCTOR LEONI DI SPOLETO PRESCRIBED FOR HIM AS IF HE DESIRED TO ADAPT HIS REMEDIES RATHER TO THE RICHES OF HIS PATIENT THAN TO HIS NECESSITIES
3664-11714-0002_6531-61334-0048 IN A MAN OF LESS HIGH PLACE THEY MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN CALLED CRIMES THE DOMINICAN GIRALAMO FRANCESCO SAVONAROLA IT WAS NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT AN INWARD FEAR AGAINST WHICH THE PRAISES OF HIS FRIENDS AVAILED NOTHING
3664-11714-0005_5390-30096-0021 HAD FLED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HAD TAKEN THE VOWS IN THE CLOISTER OF DOMINICAN MONKS AT FLORENCE THERE WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED BY HIS SUPERIORS TO GIVE LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY THE YOUNG NOVICE HAD FROM THE FIRST TO BATTLE AGAINST THE DEFECTS OF A VOICE THAT WAS BOTH HARSH AND WEAK
3664-11714-0008_1743-142912-0017 THAT INWARD PROPHETIC IMPULSE WHICH SUMMONED HIM TO PREACH THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH NEVERTHELESS THE REFORMATION OF SAVONAROLA MORE REVERENTIAL THAN LUTHER'S WHICH FOLLOWED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS LATER RESPECTED THE THING WHILE ATTACKING THE MAN
3664-11714-0009_78-369-0048 AND HAD AS ITS AIM THE ALTERING OF TEACHING THAT WAS HUMAN NOT FAITH THAT WAS OF GOD HE DID NOT WORK LIKE THE GERMAN MONK BY REASONING BUT BY ENTHUSIASM WITH HIM LOGIC ALWAYS GAVE WAY BEFORE INSPIRATION HE WAS NOT A THEOLOGIAN
3664-11714-0010_405-130895-0011 BUT A PROPHET YET ALTHOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH HE HAD ALREADY RAISED IT AGAINST THE TEMPORAL POWER TO HIM RELIGION AND LIBERTY APPEARED AS TWO VIRGINS EQUALLY SACRED
3664-11714-0011_8014-112602-0019 THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT SO LONG AS LORENZO LIVED IN RICHES HAPPINESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SAVONAROLA HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING WHATEVER ENTREATIES WERE MADE TO SANCTION BY HIS PRESENCE A POWER WHICH HE CONSIDERED ILLEGITIMATE
3664-11714-0012_2391-145015-0099 BUT LORENZO ON HIS DEATHBED SENT FOR HIM AND THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER THE AUSTERE PREACHER SET FORTH AT ONCE BAREHEADED AND BAREFOOT HOPING TO SAVE NOT ONLY THE SOUL OF THE DYING MAN BUT ALSO THE LIBERTY OF THE REPUBLIC
3664-11714-0013_1926-143879-0012 LORENZO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF SAVONAROLA WITH AN IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH UNEASINESS SO THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HIS PALE FACE TOOK A YET MORE DEATHLIKE TINGE
3664-11714-0015_248-130697-0021 THEN HE ADVANCED WITH A SLOW AND SOLEMN STEP TOWARDS THE BED LORENZO WATCHED HIS APPROACH WITH TERROR THEN WHEN HE WAS CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE CRIED O MY FATHER I HAVE BEEN A VERY GREAT SINNER THE MERCY OF GOD IS INFINITE REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0020_4014-186176-0009 EVERYTHING SAID SAVONAROLA BUT ON THREE CONDITIONS WHAT ARE THEY ASKED THE DYING MAN THE FIRST SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU FEEL A COMPLETE FAITH IN THE POWER AND THE MERCY OF GOD
3664-11714-0021_2391-145015-0001 MY FATHER REPLIED LORENZO EAGERLY I FEEL THIS FAITH IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF MY HEART THE SECOND SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU GIVE BACK THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS WHICH YOU HAVE UNJUSTLY CONFISCATED AND KEPT
3664-11714-0022_4859-26870-0001 MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0023_6925-80680-0055 EXCLAIMED LORENZO FALLING BACK ON HIS BED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD NEVER THE MONK WITHOUT REPLYING A SINGLE WORD MADE A STEP TO WITHDRAW MY FATHER MY FATHER SAID THE DYING MAN DO NOT LEAVE ME THUS HAVE PITY ON ME HAVE PITY ON FLORENCE SAID THE MONK
3664-11714-0024_5808-54425-0044 BUT MY FATHER CRIED LORENZO FLORENCE IS FREE FLORENCE IS HAPPY FLORENCE IS A SLAVE FLORENCE IS POOR CRIED SAVONAROLA POOR IN GENIUS POOR IN MONEY AND POOR IN COURAGE POOR IN GENIUS BECAUSE AFTER YOU LORENZO
3664-11714-0025_1098-133695-0025 WILL COME YOUR SON PIERO POOR IN MONEY BECAUSE FROM THE FUNDS OF THE REPUBLIC YOU HAVE KEPT UP THE MAGNIFICENCE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE CREDIT OF YOUR BUSINESS HOUSES POOR IN COURAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ROBBED THE RIGHTFUL MAGISTRATES OF THE AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY THEIRS
3664-11714-0026_1098-133695-0063 AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
3664-11714-0028_7190-90543-0035 LET THEM RUIN YOUR SOUL AS THEY HAVE RUINED YOUR BODY AND AT THESE WORDS THE AUSTERE DOMINICAN WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE CRIES OF THE DYING MAN LEFT THE ROOM AS HE HAD ENTERED IT WITH FACE AND STEP UNALTERED FAR ABOVE HUMAN THINGS HE SEEMED TO SOAR
3664-11714-0029_8630-305213-0053 A SPIRIT ALREADY DETACHED FROM THE EARTH AT THE CRY WHICH BROKE FROM LORENZO DEI MEDICI WHEN HE SAW HIM DISAPPEAR
3664-11714-0030_6880-216547-0087 AND FOUND THEIR FRIEND CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHING IN HIS ARMS A MAGNIFICENT CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE BED HEAD IN VAIN DID THEY TRY TO REASSURE HIM WITH FRIENDLY WORDS LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT ONLY REPLIED WITH SOBS
3664-11714-0031_2836-5355-0000 HIS LIPS CLINGING TO THE FEET OF THE CHRIST HE BREATHED HIS LAST IN THE ARMS OF THESE THREE MEN OF WHOM THE MOST FORTUNATE THOUGH ALL THREE WERE YOUNG WAS NOT DESTINED TO SURVIVE HIM MORE THAN TWO YEARS
3664-178355-0006_5192-19397-0057 WHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGS
3664-178355-0007_2817-142371-0051 FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
3664-178355-0008_1447-130550-0023 WHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCH
3664-178355-0011_1624-168623-0012 I HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
3664-178355-0015_8312-279790-0027 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
3664-178355-0017_4830-25904-0003 IT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUN
3664-178355-0018_5778-54535-0035 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
3664-178355-0019_405-130895-0006 THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
3664-178355-0020_6454-120342-0028 HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
3664-178355-0022_2159-179156-0009 IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
3664-178355-0023_2989-138035-0013 AND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
3664-178355-0026_78-369-0053 AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
3664-178355-0028_1743-142912-0036 BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKEN
3664-178355-0029_8838-298546-0044 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178355-0030_3947-13262-0043 EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
3664-178355-0031_1970-28415-0002 FOR THE FIRST HALF MILE SEVERAL OF THE HORSES LED BRIGHAM BUT ON THE SECOND MILE HE BEGAN PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON THE THIRD MILE HE WAS IN ADVANCE OF THEM ALL AND WAS SHOWING THEM ALL THE ROAD AT A LIVELY RATE ON THE FOURTH MILE HIS RIDER LET HIM OUT
3664-178366-0000_5322-7680-0017 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX SIGHT SEEING GENERAL ORD COMMANDING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PLATTE AT THE TIME AND WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE ALEXIS HUNT HAD SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AT FORT MC PHERSON

3664-178366-0002_78-369-0005 AND IF I WANTED A COMMISSION ONE COULD EASILY BE PROCURED FOR ME I THANKED GENERAL ORD FOR HIS KINDNESS AND SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY WAS A TEMPTING PRIZE YET I PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN THE POSITION I WAS THEN HOLDING
3664-178366-0004_5750-100289-0074 ON ARRIVING IN CHICAGO IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY COLONEL M V SHERIDAN WHO SAID THAT HIS BROTHER THE GENERAL HAD NOT YET RETURNED

3664-178366-0016_307-127535-0009 BUT OWING TO MY CONFUSION ARISING FROM THE MANY OTHER INVITATIONS I HAD RECEIVED I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT AND DINED ELSEWHERE THIS WAS A BAD BREAK BUT I DID NOT LEARN OF MY MISTAKE UNTIL NEXT DAY WHEN AT THE UNION CLUB HOUSE SEVERAL GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM LAWRENCE JEROME
3664-178366-0017_8838-298546-0026 AND WHY I HAD NOT PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT BENNETT'S DINNER THEY SAID THAT BENNETT HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO GIVE ME A SPLENDID RECEPTION THAT THE PARTY HAD WAITED TILL NINE O'CLOCK FOR ME AND THAT MY NON ARRIVAL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT

3699-19401-0004_6529-62556-0026 INTO A CORPS NO MATTER WHETHER HE LOVES THE SERVICE OR NO BEING ONCE IN IT HE ACTS AS IF HE DID AND TAKES EVERY STEP TO SHEW HIMSELF A MAN OF PROWESSE
3699-19401-0005_481-123719-0007 THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
3699-19401-0006_6563-63821-0028 FOR THIS REASON CONTINUED MY FATHER STATING THE CASE OVER AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT MISSUS WADMAN AFFECTS MY BROTHER TOBY AND MY BROTHER TOBY CONTRARIWISE AFFECTS MISSUS WADMAN
3699-19401-0008_1737-148989-0039 WE HAVE TAKEN OUR MEASURES BADLY QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING UP INTERROGATIVELY IN TRIM'S FACE I WOULD LAY MY MONTERO CAP SAID TRIM

3699-19401-0012_4297-13006-0011 BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A POPISH CLERGY WOMAN SAID TRIM TWAS A BEGUINE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY DOCTOR SLOP WAS TOO MUCH IN WRATH TO LISTEN TO THE DISTINCTION
3699-19401-0013_6272-70171-0022 AND MY FATHER TAKING THAT VERY CRISIS TO FALL IN HELTER SKELTER UPON THE WHOLE ORDER OF NUNS AND BEGUINES A SET OF SILLY FUSTY BAGGAGES SLOP COULD NOT STAND IT AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAVING SOME MEASURES TO TAKE ABOUT HIS BREECHES
3699-19401-0015_2092-145706-0034 MISSUS SHANDY BEING NOW CLOSE BESIDE ME PREPARING FOR BED I HAVE THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT ORDER AND JUST AS THEY HAVE COME INTO MY MIND SUCH HINTS AND DOCUMENTS AS I DEEM MAY BE OF USE TO THEE
3699-19401-0018_5163-18515-0016 WITHOUT FIRST RECOMMENDING THYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HE MAY DEFEND THEE FROM THE EVIL ONE SHAVE THE WHOLE TOP OF THY CROWN CLEAN
3699-19401-0020_839-130898-0051 WHATEVER THOU HAST TO SAY BE IT MORE OR LESS FORGET NOT TO UTTER IT IN A LOW SOFT TONE OF VOICE SILENCE AND WHATEVER APPROACHES IT WEAVES DREAMS OF MIDNIGHT SECRECY INTO THE BRAIN
3699-19401-0023_3242-67153-0007 THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
3699-19401-0024_4160-11549-0030 WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
3699-19402-0003_4640-19189-0029 WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
3699-19402-0005_3723-171631-0046 A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
3699-19402-0006_6563-285357-0019 MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
3699-19402-0008_8770-295465-0002 THAT TWAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP ALL FANCIES OF THAT KIND OUT OF HER HEAD NATURE HAD DONE HER PART TO HAVE SPARED HIM THIS TROUBLE AND WHAT WAS NOT A LITTLE INCONSISTENT MY FATHER KNEW IT
3699-19402-0009_1088-134315-0009 AND HERE AM I SITTING THIS TWELFTH DAY OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IN A PURPLE JERKIN AND YELLOW PAIR OF SLIPPERS WITHOUT EITHER WIG OR CAP ON A MOST TRAGICOMICAL COMPLETION OF HIS PREDICTION
3699-19402-0010_6437-66173-0001 FOR CERTAINLY KEY HOLES WERE MADE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND CONSIDERING THE ACT AS AN ACT WHICH INTERFERED WITH A TRUE PROPOSITION AND DENIED A KEY HOLE TO BE WHAT IT WAS
3699-19402-0014_6209-34601-0038 SUCH IT WAS OR RATHER SUCH WOULD IT HAVE SEEM'D UPON ANY OTHER BROW BUT THE SWEET LOOK OF GOODNESS WHICH SAT UPON MY UNCLE TOBY'S ASSIMILATED EVERY THING AROUND IT SO SOVEREIGNLY TO ITSELF
3699-19402-0016_3259-158083-0031 IN A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TOTAL INACTIVITY IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIFE FOR HE SELDOM WENT FURTHER THAN THE BOWLING GREEN
3699-19402-0022_4441-76263-0036 BUT NOT VAPOURINGLY AND WITH THE SWEETEST ACCENT OF MOST RESPECTFUL ENCOURAGEMENT BID HIS HONOUR NEVER FEAR NOW MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEAR AND GRIEVOUSLY TOO
3699-19402-0024_5750-100289-0023 AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
3699-19402-0030_3112-9555-0002 A THOUSAND OF MY FATHER'S MOST SUBTLE SYLLOGISMS COULD NOT HAVE SAID MORE FOR CELIBACY MY UNCLE TOBY LOOK'D EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE AND HIS BOWLING GREEN
3699-47246-0001_2843-152918-0042 NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
3699-47246-0002_40-121026-0038 BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
3699-47246-0008_201-127786-0029 HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
3699-47246-0014_7367-86737-0038 AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
3699-47246-0017_254-27760-0032 ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
3699-47246-0018_7511-102420-0043 WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
3699-47246-0020_3112-9555-0013 AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
3699-47246-0023_1624-168623-0052 THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
3699-47246-0024_5789-57158-0001 WHY IT MUST LIE IN THE POSSESSION OF SOME VICES FROM WHICH THEY WERE UNDENIABLY FREE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT MILBY RESPECTABILITY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI
3699-47246-0025_8051-295385-0003 IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
3699-47246-0027_2436-2476-0005 AND SHUNS A COLDLY SATIRICAL EYE AS SHE WOULD SHUN A GORGON AND SHE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER FOR CLERICAL NOTICE AND FRIENDSHIP NOT MERELY BECAUSE THAT IS QUITE THE MOST RESPECTABLE COUNTENANCE TO BE OBTAINED IN SOCIETY
3699-47246-0029_6367-65536-0021 THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
3723-171115-0000_3214-167607-0031 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE DEATH OF JOSEPH HEROD'S BROTHER WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNIFIED TO HEROD IN DREAMS HOW HEROD WAS PRESERVED TWICE AFTER A WONDERFUL MANNER HE CUTS OFF THE HEAD OF PAPPUS
3723-171115-0001_403-128339-0027 WHO WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS BROTHER AND SENDS THAT HEAD TO HIS OTHER BROTHER PHERORAS
3723-171115-0003_7059-88364-0008 FOR THAT MACHAERUS WOULD NOT BE SUCH AN ASSISTANT AS HE COULD DEPEND ON AS IT APPEARED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE ALREADY
3723-171115-0004_289-121652-0027 AND MARCHED TOWARDS JERICHO WITH FIVE COHORTS WHICH MACHAERUS SENT WITH HIM
3723-171115-0007_8770-295463-0019 TO ASSIST HEROD AND FOLLOWED HIMSELF SOON AFTER WITH THE REST OF HIS ARMY THREE NOW WHEN HEROD WAS AT DAPHNE BY ANTIOCH HE HAD SOME DREAMS WHICH CLEARLY FOREBODED HIS BROTHER'S DEATH
3723-171115-0010_6000-55211-0057 YET WAS HE FORCED BY A MOST TERRIBLE STORM TO PITCH HIS CAMP IN THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGES BEFORE HE COULD TAKE IT BUT WHEN AFTER A FEW DAYS TIME THE SECOND LEGION THAT CAME FROM ANTONY JOINED THEMSELVES TO HIM
3723-171115-0013_4898-28461-0062 IN WHICH ACTION HEROD'S OWN SIDE WAS WOUNDED WITH A DART FIVE NOW AS ANTIGONUS HAD A MIND TO APPEAR TO EXCEED HEROD NOT ONLY IN THE COURAGE BUT IN THE NUMBER OF HIS MEN HE SENT PAPPUS ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WITH AN ARMY AGAINST SAMARIA
3723-171115-0014_7278-246956-0003 BUT HEROD OVERRAN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND DEMOLISHED FIVE LITTLE CITIES AND DESTROYED TWO THOUSAND MEN THAT WERE IN THEM AND BURNED THEIR HOUSES AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS CAMP BUT HIS HEAD QUARTERS WERE AT THE VILLAGE CALLED CANA SIX
3723-171115-0015_3112-9555-0091 NOW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF JEWS RESORTED TO HIM EVERY DAY BOTH OUT OF JERICHO AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME WERE MOVED SO TO DO OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO ANTIGONUS AND SOME OUT OF REGARD TO THE GLORIOUS ACTIONS HEROD HAD DONE
3723-171115-0017_6209-34599-0031 AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT NOW OTHER PARTS OF THEIR ARMY MADE RESISTANCE FOR A WHILE BUT HEROD RUNNING THE UTMOST HAZARD OUT OF THE RAGE HE WAS IN AT THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER THAT HE MIGHT BE AVENGED ON THOSE THAT HAD BEEN THE AUTHORS OF IT
3723-171115-0018_6563-63821-0003 SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
3723-171115-0022_8108-274318-0036 UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF WHICH VICTORY HEROD HAD MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO JERUSALEM
3723-171115-0024_233-134440-0024 ONE OF THE ENEMIES MET HIM IN THE FACE WITH A SWORD IN HIS HAND AND THEN A SECOND AND THEN A THIRD AND AFTER THAT MORE OF THEM THESE WERE MEN WHO HAD RUN AWAY OUT OF THE BATTLE INTO THE BATH IN THEIR ARMOR
3723-171115-0027_2007-149877-0052 BUT ON THE NEXT DAY HEROD HAD PAPPUS'S HEAD CUT OFF WHO WAS THE GENERAL FOR ANTIGONUS AND WAS SLAIN IN THE BATTLE AND SENT IT TO HIS BROTHER PHERORAS BY WAY OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SLAIN BROTHER FOR HE WAS THE MAN THAT SLEW JOSEPH
3723-171115-0029_6019-3185-0064 ACQUAINTANCE AT THE WORKS BUT HE WENT HIMSELF TO SAMARIA TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS TO WIFE WHO HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO HIM BEFORE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
3723-171115-0031_6454-107462-0032 SOSIUS ALSO JOINED HIM WITH A LARGE ARMY BOTH OF HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN WHICH HE SENT BEFORE HIM THROUGH THE MIDLAND PARTS WHILE HE MARCHED HIMSELF ALONG PHOENICIA AND WHEN THE WHOLE ARMY WAS GOTTEN TOGETHER
3723-171115-0032_2893-139322-0003 WHICH WERE ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF FOOTMEN AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE SYRIAN AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE NO SMALL PART OF THE ARMY THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR TO THE NORTH WALL HEROD'S DEPENDENCE WAS UPON THE DECREE OF THE SENATE
3723-171115-0041_150-132655-0014 AND BY REASON THAT THE JEWS WHO WERE ABOUT HEROD EARNESTLY ENDEAVORED THAT NONE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES MIGHT REMAIN SO THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES BY GREAT MULTITUDES AS THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN NARROW STREETS AND IN HOUSES OR WERE RUNNING AWAY TO THE TEMPLE
3723-171115-0043_307-127535-0011 OR LET HIM GO FREE BUT PUT HIM INTO BONDS AND KEPT HIM IN CUSTODY THREE BUT HEROD'S CONCERN AT PRESENT NOW HE HAD GOTTEN HIS ENEMIES UNDER HIS POWER
3723-171115-0044_5867-48852-0034 WAS TO RESTRAIN THE ZEAL OF HIS FOREIGN AUXILIARIES FOR THE MULTITUDE OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE WERE VERY EAGER TO SEE THE TEMPLE AND WHAT WAS SACRED IN THE HOLY HOUSE ITSELF BUT THE KING ENDEAVORED TO RESTRAIN THEM PARTLY BY HIS EXHORTATIONS
3723-171115-0046_3947-13262-0022 HE ALSO FORBADE AT THE SAME TIME THE SPOILING OF THE CITY ASKING SOSIUS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER WHETHER THE ROMANS BY THUS EMPTYING THE CITY OF MONEY AND MEN HAD A MIND TO LEAVE HIM KING OF A DESERT
3723-171115-0047_3214-167607-0010 AND TOLD HIM THAT HE JUDGED THE DOMINION OF THE HABITABLE EARTH TOO SMALL A COMPENSATION FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF SO MANY CITIZENS
3723-171115-0050_2518-154825-0020 LEADING ANTIGONUS AWAY IN BONDS TO ANTONY THEN DID THE AXE BRING HIM TO HIS END
3723-171115-0052_311-124404-0104 HEREUPON KING HEROD DISTINGUISHED THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS IN THE CITY
3723-171115-0055_1963-147036-0017 AND SECRETLY LABORED TO HAVE HEROD AND MALICHUS THE KINGS OF BOTH THOSE NATIONS SLAIN BY HIS ORDER FIVE NOW IS TO THESE HER INJUNCTIONS TO ANTONY HE COMPLIED IN PART
3723-171115-0056_4813-248641-0032 AND HAD CONDUCTED ANTONY IN HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS AS FAR AS EUPHRATES SHE CAME BY APAMIA AND DAMASCUS INTO JUDEA AND THERE DID HEROD PACIFY HER INDIGNATION AT HIM BY LARGE PRESENTS
3723-171631-0000_839-130898-0030 MINISTRANT ARS ET NATURA INSTILLANT THEY USE CORDIALS TO KEEP THE VENOM AND MALIGNITY OF THE DISEASE FROM THE HEART ELEVEN MEDITATION
3723-171631-0002_909-131044-0015 THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
3723-171631-0003_3830-12531-0011 BUT IF AN ENEMY DARE RISE UP AGAINST IT IT IS THE SOONEST ENDANGERED THE SOONEST DEFEATED OF ANY PART THE BRAIN WILL HOLD OUT LONGER THAN IT AND THE LIVER LONGER THAN THAT THEY WILL ENDURE A SIEGE
3723-171631-0006_163-122947-0039 THOUGH IT BE NOT THE STRONGEST PART AS THE ELDEST IS OFTENTIMES NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE FAMILY AND SINCE THE BRAIN AND LIVER AND HEART HOLD NOT A TRIUMVIRATE IN MAN A SOVEREIGNTY EQUALLY SHED UPON THEM ALL
3723-171631-0009_2989-138035-0075 AS ALL LAWS OF PROPRIETY IN THAT WHICH WE POSSESS ARE OF THE LAW OF NATURE WHICH LAW IS TO GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN AND YET IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF NATURE THERE WAS NO PROPRIETY
3723-171631-0015_39-121914-0054 THE HEART WHICH IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE KINGS OF THIS WORLD GREAT MEN THAT THE VENOM AND POISON OF EVERY PESTILENTIAL DISEASE DIRECTS ITSELF TO THE HEART AFFECTS THAT PERNICIOUS AFFECTION
3723-171631-0019_150-126107-0026 IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0020_5867-48852-0003 THAT ALL IS UNDER HIS FEET AND THE BRAIN THAT THINKS SO IS BUT EARTH HIS HIGHEST REGION THE FLESH THAT COVERS THAT IS BUT EARTH AND EVEN THE TOP OF THAT

374-180298-0002_1455-138263-0026 I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM
374-180298-0003_4406-16883-0031 ASSUMED ALL AT ONCE AN APPEARANCE OF NOISE AND DISORDER NEVER BELIEVE HOWEVER DISINTERESTED THE LOVE OF A KEPT WOMAN MAY BE THAT IT WILL COST ONE NOTHING

374-180298-0007_2391-145015-0048 MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON

374-180298-0013_8468-286673-0006 MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION
374-180298-0014_4137-11701-0031 AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
374-180298-0015_78-368-0016 FORMERLY WHEN ONE WENT TO FRASCATI ONE HAD THE CHANCE OF MAKING A FORTUNE ONE PLAYED AGAINST MONEY AND IF ONE LOST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSOLATION OF SAYING THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE GAINED WHEREAS NOW EXCEPT IN THE CLUBS
374-180298-0019_307-127539-0037 WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY
374-180298-0020_696-93314-0065 I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
374-180298-0021_7148-7763-0034 THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
374-180298-0023_3486-166424-0043 AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
374-180298-0024_5163-39921-0030 FOR THE MOST OF THEM GAMBLING WAS A NECESSITY FOR ME IT WAS A REMEDY FREE OF MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF GAMBLING THUS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT I PRESERVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SELF POSSESSION
374-180298-0025_3486-166446-0024 I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
374-180298-0031_1867-154075-0043 MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
374-180298-0034_6081-41998-0001 UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
374-180298-0038_8095-274346-0013 MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
374-180298-0040_7447-91187-0013 PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
374-180298-0042_8419-286676-0018 ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS

374-180298-0044_302-123516-0006 BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
374-180298-0046_8063-274115-0020 I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
374-180298-0048_5703-47198-0008 IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME
374-180298-0050_302-123516-0018 AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
374-180298-0051_322-124147-0010 THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
374-180298-0053_78-369-0051 MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY
374-180298-0054_6367-74004-0019 ADD TO THIS THAT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE ON THE SHORE A CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE OF TWO STORIES WITH A SEMICIRCULAR RAILING THROUGH THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE A GREEN LAWN SMOOTH AS VELVET

374-180299-0000_3983-5371-0055 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING

3807-4955-0030_5393-19218-0025 AND THEN SAID IN TONES TREMBLING WITH GREED IT'S A FIRE LIE TO AND LOWER AWAY THE JOLLY BOAT OLD MAN THAT'S OUR BIRD FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS THE PRETTY MARY SHORTENED SAIL AND BLUNT AND STAPLES GOT INTO THE JOLLY BOAT

3807-4955-0037_5192-19397-0016 THE LIGHT WAS LAMBENT AND UNCERTAIN NOW SINKING ALMOST INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND NOW LEAPING UP WITH A FIERCENESS THAT CAUSED A DEEP GLOW TO THROB IN THE VERY HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES A BLACK FIGURE WOULD PASS ACROSS THIS GIGANTIC FURNACE MOUTH
3830-12529-0000_8098-278278-0009 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001_7800-283493-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0002_7059-77900-0027 GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
3830-12529-0003_3374-298032-0035 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004_4397-15666-0016 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12530-0001_5867-48852-0093 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0003_8629-261139-0019 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004_8609-283227-0036 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005_7190-90543-0006 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0011_19-227-0065 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012_5652-19215-0060 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0014_8123-275193-0015 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015_3723-171115-0019 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0017_2817-142371-0074 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018_1992-141719-0001 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019_6529-62556-0017 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020_289-121665-0035 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0024_4406-16883-0010 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025_8238-283452-0038 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026_1502-122619-0045 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0028_6454-107462-0031 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0031_229-130880-0078 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0034_5393-19219-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0036_8108-280359-0010 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037_7367-86737-0078 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038_7367-86737-0026 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0040_7226-86964-0008 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0043_6385-34655-0017 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0045_5192-19396-0001 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0004_1743-142912-0027 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0006_40-222-0022 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0009_1502-122615-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010_2416-152139-0067 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0012_6531-61334-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0018_7517-100437-0024 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0020_8312-279791-0016 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021_5104-33406-0047 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022_8609-283227-0020 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023_4830-25904-0024 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0025_1081-125237-0054 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026_8088-284756-0023 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027_5514-19193-0017 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028_4051-11218-0009 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12535-0000_1355-39947-0075 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001_7302-86815-0014 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0004_1553-140047-0027 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005_911-128684-0060 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0007_4362-15663-0002 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008_3983-5331-0034 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0011_8098-275181-0020 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0014_4441-76263-0044 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0016_7517-100442-0029 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0023_4014-186179-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024_6836-61803-0010 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0027_5750-100289-0000 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028_2159-179156-0024 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0031_6081-41997-0015 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0033_6925-80680-0029 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
3857-180923-0001_211-122425-0045 BUT TO DEAL WITH THE REGIMENT ON THE PERSONAL SIDE IS HARDLY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF SUCH A SKETCH AS THIS THOUGH IT IS A MATTER THAT CANNOT BE ENTIRELY PASSED BY
3857-180923-0003_4267-78186-0023 OR THAN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE SAME SERVICE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED YET TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SUCH EXPERIENCES AS HAVE BEEN RECOUNTED WHICH BECAME FOR THEM FOR A TIME THE COMMONPLACES OF EVERY DAY LIFE
3857-180923-0004_8747-293952-0098 IS ENOUGH TO PLACE THEM APART FROM ORDINARY MEN IN THE EYES OF OUR PEACE KNOWING GENERATION IN FACT TO HAVE PASSED THE TESTS OF SO FIERCE A COURSE OF EDUCATION GIVES THEM A TITLE TO A PLACE THUS APART THE UNIVERSITY MAN OF TO DAY
3857-180923-0007_4481-17499-0000 A NUMBER OF THE OFFICERS AND MEN WERE COLLEGE GRADUATES WHEN THEY ENLISTED AND OTHERS GAINED DEGREES AFTER THE WAR ENDED THE LIST WHICH FOLLOWS IS HOWEVER NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE IN FACT AN ABSOLUTELY CORRECT LIST IS NO DOUBT HOPELESSLY IMPOSSIBLE
3857-180923-0009_233-155990-0024 ILL HEALTH FORCED HIM TO RELINQUISH HIS COMMISSION EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR AND UNTIL HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WAS A LEADING CITIZEN OF THE COUNTY JUDGE AUGUSTUS H FENN MAJOR AND BREVET COLONEL
3857-180923-0010_1334-135589-0030 CAME BACK FROM THE WAR HAVING LOST AN ARM AT CEDAR CREEK TO TAKE A COURSE IN THE LAW SCHOOL AT HARVARD AND YALE MADE HIM A MASTER OF ARTS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE HIS PROMINENCE FOR MANY YEARS IN PUBLIC LIFE AND AS JUDGE IN THE HIGHEST COURTS IN THE STATE IS WELL KNOWN
3857-180923-0011_6563-63821-0019 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN HE WAS A LECTURER IN THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS
3857-180923-0014_8108-280354-0016 AND RECEIVED A DEGREE FROM TRINITY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE SURGEON HENRY PLUMB AND ASSISTANT SURGEONS ROBERT G HAZZARD AND JOHN W LAWTON WERE ALL GRADUATES OF THE YALE MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE CLASSES OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
3857-180923-0015_1841-179183-0031 AND AFTER THE WAR WAS FOR SOME YEARS RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH IN SALISBURY HE WAS LATER CONNECTED WITH A CHURCH COLLEGE IN MISSOURI WHERE HE DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT
3857-180923-0021_8770-295465-0037 A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION WOULD ALSO GIVE A LARGE PLACE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF ITS VETERANS FORMED SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR WHOSE FREQUENT GATHERINGS HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL LIKENESS TO THE REUNIONS OF COLLEGE CLASSES
3857-180923-0023_1578-140049-0025 AS A WHOLE THE REGIMENT WAS A BODY THOROUGHLY REPRESENTATIVE NOT ONLY OF THE ARMY OF WHICH IT WAS A FRACTION AN ARMY AS HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID UNLIKE ANY OTHER THE WORLD HAS KNOWN BUT ALSO OF THE POPULATION FROM WHICH IT WAS DRAWN
3857-180923-0024_5456-24741-0002 IT WAS MADE UP OF MEN OF ALMOST ALL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND OF WIDELY DIFFERENT AGES THOUGH NATURALLY WITH YOUNG MEN IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF MECHANICS FROM THE HOUSATONIC AND NAUGATUCK VALLEYS AND FARMERS BOYS FROM THE HILLS OF MEN OF EDUCATION AND MEN OF NONE
3857-180923-0025_5750-35690-0012 THOUGH THE LARGE ADDITION TO ITS NUMBERS WHICH THE INCREASE IN SIZE NECESSITATED MADE IT PERHAPS SOMEWHAT LESS HOMOGENEOUS THAN AT FIRST IT DID NOT GREATLY ALTER ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
3857-180923-0026_2911-12359-0006 THE RECORDS KEPT BY THE ASSOCIATION REFERRED TO FURNISH SUGGESTIVE REVELATIONS AS TO THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT COMPOSED IT THE NAMES OF MEN OF EVERY SORT AND KIND ARE FOUND UPON THE ROLLS THERE WERE VETERANS OF THE MEXICAN WAR
3857-180923-0027_481-123720-0031 THERE WERE REFUGEES FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY UPRISINGS IN EUROPE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT THERE WERE SOME WHO HAD SERVED UNDER COMPULSION IN THE ARMIES OF THE SOUTH THERE WERE MEN WHOSE OBVIOUSLY FICTITIOUS NAMES CONCEALED STORIES WHICH COULD BE GUESSED TO BE EXTRAORDINARY
3857-180923-0028_311-124404-0088 THERE WERE NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS AMONG THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST HONORED IN THIS STATE AND THERE WERE THOSE OF OUTCASTS AND WRECKS A LARGE PART OF THESE MEN CAME BACK AFTER THEIR SERVICE ENDED TO RESUME THE PEACEFUL LIFE OF CITIZENSHIP
3857-182315-0000_8095-274346-0052 HOW I HATE THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT THE BRUTE CREATION WITH AN UGLY EMPHASIS ON BRUTE AS FOR ME I AM PROUD OF MY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
3857-182315-0001_1447-130552-0024 I TAKE A JEALOUS PRIDE IN MY SIMIAN ANCESTRY I LIKE TO THINK THAT I WAS ONCE A MAGNIFICENT HAIRY FELLOW LIVING IN THE TREES AND THAT MY FRAME HAS COME DOWN THROUGH GEOLOGICAL TIME VIA SEA JELLY AND WORMS
3857-182315-0003_4680-16026-0025 LAST SUNDAY POTTER TOOK ME OUT DRIVING ALONG UPPER BROADWAY WHERE THOSE LONG ROWS OF TALL NEW APARTMENT HOUSES WERE BUILT A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A MILD AFTERNOON AND GREAT CROWDS OF PEOPLE WERE OUT
3857-182315-0005_669-129074-0024 I TURNED AND ASKED WHY WHAT ABOUT THEM I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE HAD AN IDEA OR A HEADACHE OTHER CREATURES DON'T DO IT HE REPLIED WITH A DISCOURAGED EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0007_6081-41998-0026 I CAN GET NO SENSE WHATEVER OF INDIVIDUAL WORTH OR OF VALUE IN MEN AS A RACE WHEN I SEE THEM LIKE THIS IT MAKES ONE ALMOST DESPAIR OF CIVILIZATION I THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR AWHILE
3857-182315-0008_32-4137-0026 AND YET AT OTHER TIMES I TOO FEEL LIKE A SPECTATOR AN ALIEN BUT EVEN THEN I HAD NEVER FELT SO ALIEN OR DESPAIRING AS POTTER LET'S REMEMBER I SAID IT'S A SIMIAN CIVILIZATION
3857-182315-0009_2691-156745-0026 POTTER WAS STARING DISGUSTEDLY AT SOME VAUDEVILLE SIGN BOARDS YES I SAID THOSE FOR EXAMPLE ARE DISTINCTIVELY SIMIAN WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOMETHING INEVITABLE AND I WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WE WERE DESCENDED FROM
3857-182315-0010_6064-300880-0004 EAGLES FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BROADLY SPEAKING FROM APE LIKE OR MONKEYISH BEINGS BEING OF SIMIAN STOCK WE HAD SIMIAN TRAITS OUR DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY BORE THE MARKS OF OUR ORIGIN
3857-182315-0012_3168-173564-0007 IF A GOD OR SOME PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH HAD GONE THAT WAY TO WORK WITH US HE OR IT MIGHT HAVE MOLDED US IN MUCH MORE SPLENDID FORMS BUT CONSIDERING OUR SIMIAN DESCENT IT HAS DONE VERY WELL
3857-182315-0016_8312-279790-0021 THERE ARE ALSO QUEER LIMITATIONS THREE IN THOSE DISTANT INVISIBLE EPOCHS BEFORE MEN EXISTED BEFORE EVEN THE PROUD MISSING LINK STRUTTED AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS
3857-182315-0019_8580-287363-0028 AND KEPT US IN CAGES OR SHOW US FOR SPORT IN THE FOREST WHILE THEY RULED THE WORLD SO POTTER AND I DEVELOPING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT BEGAN TO IMAGINE WE HAD LIVED MANY AGES AGO AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAD ALIGHTED HERE FROM SOME OLDER PLANET
3857-182315-0021_2416-152139-0017 IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER THE TREND OF EVENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO APPRAISE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS THEY WANDERED AROUND EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF GOOD AND BAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH GROUP WE'D HAVE WONDERED WOULD EVER CONTRIVE TO RULE ALL THE REST
3857-182315-0022_1263-141777-0022 AND HOW GREAT A DEVELOPMENT COULD THEY ATTAIN TO THEREAFTER
3857-182315-0023_8797-294123-0086 WE MIGHT FIRST HAVE CONSIDERED THE LEMURS OR APES THEY HAD HANDS AESTHETICALLY VIEWED THE POOR SIMIANS WERE SIMPLY GROTESQUE BUT TRAVELERS WHO KNEW OTHER PLANETS MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT BEAUTY MAY SPRING FROM AN UNCOUTH BEGINNING IN THIS MAGIC UNIVERSE
3857-182315-0025_7148-82991-0014 THEY ARE NOT EASILY LEFT BEHIND EVEN AFTER LONG STAGES AND THEY FORM A TERRIBLE OBSTACLE TO ALL HIGH ADVANCEMENT
3857-182315-0026_403-126855-0006 THE BEES OR THE ANTS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US MORE PROMISING THEIR SMALLNESS OF SIZE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TOO MUCH OF A HANDICAP THEY COULD HAVE MADE POISON THEIR WEAPON FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF RIVALS
3857-182315-0027_60-121082-0082 AND IN THESE ORDERLY INSECTS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A CAPACITY FOR LABOR AND CO OPERATIVE LABOR AT THAT WHICH COULD CARRY THEM FAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MARKED GENIUS GREAT GIFTS OF THEIR OWN
3857-182315-0028_460-172359-0056 IN A CIVILIZATION OF SUPER ANTS OR BEES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM OF THE HUNGRY UNEMPLOYED NO POVERTY NO UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT NO RIOTS NO STRIKES FOR SHORT HOURS
3857-182315-0029_3436-172171-0022 NO DERISION OF EUGENICS NO THIEVES PERHAPS NO CRIME AT ALL ANTS ARE GOOD CITIZENS THEY PLACE GROUP INTERESTS FIRST BUT THEY CARRY IT SO FAR THEY HAVE FEW OR NO POLITICAL RIGHTS
3857-182315-0031_5163-18515-0042 SO THE EGOTISM OF THE GROUPS IS EXTREMELY FEROCIOUS AND ACTIVE IS THIS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ANTS FIGHT SO MUCH WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME PHENOMENON OCCUR IN CERTAIN NATIONS OF MEN AND THE ANTS COMMIT ATROCITIES IN AND AFTER THEIR BATTLES THAT ARE
3857-182315-0032_254-27760-0026 I WISH I COULD TRULY SAY INHUMAN BUT CONVERSELY ANTS ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSELFISH WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SKILFUL INGENIOUS THEIR NESTS AND BUILDINGS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER THAN MAN'S
3857-182315-0034_6454-120342-0016 DARWIN SAID THE ANT'S BRAIN WAS ONE OF THE MOST MARVELOUS ATOMS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE BRAIN OF MAN YES OF PRESENT DAY MAN WHO FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS HAD SO MUCH MORE CHANCE TO DEVELOP HIS BRAIN
3857-182315-0035_6181-216552-0005 A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE WEIGHED ALL THESE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHEN WE THINK OF THESE CREATURES AS LITTLE MEN WHICH IS ALL WRONG OF COURSE WE SEE THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS TO OUR EYES THEY SEEM TOO ORDERLY FOR INSTANCE
3857-182315-0038_446-123502-0031 AND INSTEAD OF MERELY STRUGGLING WITH NATURE FOR IT THEY ALSO FIGHT OTHER ANTS THE CUSTOM OF PLUNDER SEEMS TO BE A PART OF MOST OF THEIR WARS THIS HAS GONE ON FOR AGES AMONG THEM AND CONTINUES TODAY
3857-182315-0041_5104-33407-0027 THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
3857-182315-0043_2911-7601-0034 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE THEREWITH TO RULE THEIR INSTINCTS OR TO STOP WORK LONG ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES OR THE UNIVERSE OR TO DREAM OF ANY NOBLE DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY NOT REASON IS SELDOM OR NEVER THE RULER
3857-182315-0045_7148-59157-0038 IT'S BY VIRTUE OF FEVERISH TOIL THAT YOU HAVE BECOME WHAT YOU ARE BEING ENDLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS IS THE BEST ROAD FOR YOU TO THE HEIGHTS
3857-182317-0000_6454-120342-0009 SOME HAD OVER TRUSTFUL CHARACTERS LIKE THE SEALS OR EXPLOITABLE CHARACTERS LIKE COWS AND CHICKENS AND SHEEP SUCH CREATURES SENTENCE THEMSELVES TO BE CAPTIVES BY THEIR LACK OF AMBITION DOGS THEY HAVE MORE SPIRIT
3857-182317-0001_248-130697-0036 BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE OF KINGSHIP THROUGH WORSHIPPING US THE DOG'S FINER QUALITIES CAN'T BE PRAISED TOO WARMLY THERE IS A PURITY ABOUT HIS DEVOTION WHICH MAKES MERE MEN FEEL SPEECHLESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE FOR DOGS
3857-182317-0004_5561-41615-0026 DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
3857-182317-0005_118-47824-0061 AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
3857-182317-0006_4680-16042-0034 AND WELL SHOULD THE ELEPHANT KNOW IT HE HAD THE BEST CHANCE OF ALL WISER EVEN THAN THE LION OR THE WISEST OF APES HIS WISDOM FURTHERMORE WAS BENIGN WHERE THEIRS WAS SINISTER CONSIDER HIS DIGNITY HIS POISE AND SKILL
3857-182317-0010_8063-274116-0034 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0011_831-130739-0021 JUST AS ANTS ARE TOO ENERGETIC AND CATS TOO SHREWD FOR THEIR OWN HIGHEST GOOD SO THE ELEPHANTS SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH PATIENCE THEIR EXHIBITIONS OF IT MAY SEEM SUPERB SUCH POWER AND SUCH RESTRAINT COMBINED ARE NOBLE
3857-182317-0013_6454-107462-0000 ALL SPECIES MUST SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY THOSE ARE OUR TERMS AND COME AND LIVE IN BARNS ALONGSIDE US OR ON US AS PARASITES THE CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN WE CALL WILD IF WILD
3857-182317-0015_3664-178355-0000 WHEN ONE OF US CONQUERING MONKEY MEN ENTERS THE WOODS MOST ANIMALS THAT SCENT HIM SLINK AWAY OR RACE OFF IN A PANIC IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS DELIBERATELY BUT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LIKE RACE BY RACE THEY HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED
3857-182317-0016_4853-27670-0011 SOON ALL WILL BE GONE WE GIVE NEITHER FREEDOM NOR LIFE ROOM TO THOSE WE DEFEAT IF WE HAD BEEN AS STRONG AS THE ELEPHANTS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER WHEN GREAT POWER COMES NATURALLY TO PEOPLE
3857-182317-0017_2436-2477-0022 IT IS USED MORE URBANELY WE USE IT AS PARVENUS DO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THE ELEPHANT BEING BORN TO IT IS EASY GOING CONFIDENT TOLERANT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE HUMANE KING
3857-182317-0018_1723-141149-0095 THE ELEPHANT IS STUPID WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING HOW TO USE TOOLS SO ARE ALL OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR OWN ISN'T IT STRANGE A TOOL IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE SENSE IS ANY OBJECT LYING AROUND
3857-182317-0019_200-124139-0001 THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE MANY CREATURES USE OBJECTS AS MATERIALS AS BIRDS USE TWIGS FOR NESTS BUT THE STEP THAT NO ANIMAL TAKES IS LEARNING FREELY TO USE THINGS AS INSTRUMENTS
3857-182317-0020_2289-152253-0026 WHEN AN ELEPHANT PLUCKS OFF A BRANCH AND SWISHES HIS FLANKS AND THUS KEEPS AWAY INSECTS HE IS USING A TOOL BUT HE DOES IT ONLY BY A VAGUE AND HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IF HE ONCE BECAME A CONSCIOUS USER OF TOOLS
3857-182317-0021_2196-174172-0022 HE WOULD OF COURSE GO MUCH FURTHER WE OURSELVES WHO ARE SO GOOD AT IT NOW WERE SLOW ENOUGH IN BEGINNING THINK OF THE LONG EPOCHS THAT PASSED BEFORE IT ENTERED OUR HEADS
3857-182317-0024_412-126975-0022 INSTEAD OF STICKING TO INSTINCT NOW STICKING TO INSTINCT HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES BUT SO HAS USING REASON WHICHEVER FACULTY YOU USE THE OTHER ATROPHIES AND PARTLY DESERTS YOU WE ARE TRYING TO USE BOTH
3857-182317-0025_1743-142913-0009 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3857-182317-0026_6529-62554-0048 TORN BETWEEN THOSE TWO VOICES WAILING LOUDLY AT NIGHT BY A RIVER IN HIS PUZZLED DISTRESS MY POOR FAR OFF BROTHER
3857-182317-0028_8580-287364-0005 SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
3857-182317-0030_6385-220959-0022 WE ATTAIN NO POWER OVER NATURE TILL WE LEARN NATURAL LAWS AND OUR LORDSHIP DEPENDS ON THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH WE LEARN AND CONFORM ADROITNESS HOWEVER IS MERELY AN ABILITY TO WIN
3857-182317-0031_669-129074-0006 BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
3857-182317-0032_6147-34607-0009 BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
3857-182317-0033_6209-34601-0001 IN ADDITION TO THESE A RACE TO BE GREAT NEEDS SOME HUNGER SOME ITCH TO SPUR IT UP THE HARD PATH WE LATELY HAVE LEARNED TO CALL EVOLUTION THE LOVE OF TOIL IN THE ANTS AND OF CRAFT IN CATS ARE EXAMPLES
3879-173592-0000_7078-271888-0059 SAGACIOUS BOLD AND RESTLESS HE PUSHED HIS WAY FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND PRETENDED TO HAVE REACHED THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAINS OF APPALACHE HE SENT TO THE FORT MANTLES WOVEN WITH FEATHERS QUIVERS COVERED WITH CHOICE FURS
3879-173592-0001_2518-154825-0045 ARROWS TIPPED WITH GOLD WEDGES OF A GREEN STONE LIKE BERYL OR EMERALD AND OTHER TROPHIES OF HIS WANDERINGS A GENTLEMAN NAMED GROTAUT TOOK UP THE QUEST AND PENETRATED TO THE DOMINIONS OF HOSTAQUA
3879-173592-0002_8797-294123-0039 WHO IT WAS PRETENDED COULD MUSTER THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND WARRIORS AND WHO PROMISED WITH THE AID OF A HUNDRED ARQUEBUSIERS TO CONQUER ALL THE KINGS OF THE ADJACENT MOUNTAINS AND SUBJECT THEM AND THEIR GOLD MINES TO THE RULE OF THE FRENCH
3879-173592-0003_8324-286681-0011 A HUMBLER ADVENTURER WAS PIERRE GAMBIE A ROBUST AND DARING YOUTH
3879-173592-0005_8108-274318-0014 MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER AND IN HIS ABSENCE REIGNED IN HIS STEAD BUT AS HIS SWAY VERGED TOWARDS DESPOTISM HIS SUBJECTS TOOK OFFENCE AND SPLIT HIS HEAD WITH A HATCHET DURING THE WINTER
3879-173592-0007_2843-152918-0016 THEY TOLD OF THE KING OF CABS ON WHOSE DOMAINS THEY HAD BEEN WRECKED A CHIEF MIGHTY IN STATURE AND IN POWER IN ONE OF HIS VILLAGES WAS A PIT SIX FEET DEEP AND AS WIDE AS A HOGSHEAD
3879-173592-0008_3374-298026-0006 FILLED WITH TREASURE GATHERED FROM SPANISH WRECKS ON ADJACENT REEFS AND KEYS THE MONARCH WAS A PRIEST TOO AND A MAGICIAN WITH POWER OVER THE ELEMENTS EACH YEAR HE WITHDREW FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE
3879-173592-0009_8609-283227-0025 TO HOLD CONVERSE IN SECRET WITH SUPERNAL OR INFERNAL POWERS AND EACH YEAR HE SACRIFICED TO HIS GODS ONE OF THE SPANIARDS WHOM THE FORTUNE OF THE SEA HAD CAST UPON HIS SHORES
3879-173592-0011_1069-133699-0045 IN MARRIAGE TO HIS GREAT ALLY BUT AS THE BRIDE WITH HER BRIDESMAIDS WAS JOURNEYING TOWARDS CALOS ESCORTED BY A CHOSEN BAND THEY WERE ASSAILED BY A WILD AND WARLIKE RACE INHABITANTS OF AN ISLAND CALLED
3879-173592-0012_5192-19397-0071 IN THE MIDST OF A LAKE WHO PUT THE WARRIORS TO FLIGHT BORE THE MAIDENS CAPTIVE TO THEIR WATERY FASTNESS ESPOUSED THEM ALL AND WE ARE ASSURED
3879-173592-0018_3807-4923-0046 AND NOW IN AMPLE MEASURE THE FRENCH BEGAN TO REAP THE HARVEST OF THEIR FOLLY CONQUEST GOLD AND MILITARY OCCUPATION HAD ALONE BEEN THEIR AIMS
3879-173592-0021_328-129766-0070 THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY WHEN RIBAUT AND HIS COMPANIONS FULL OF DELIGHTED ANTICIPATION HAD FIRST EXPLORED
3879-173592-0029_89-218-0023 COULD THEIR EYES HAVE PIERCED THE FUTURE THE INDIANS HAD LEFT THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT FROM TIME TO TIME BROUGHT IN MEAGRE SUPPLIES OF FISH WHICH THEY SOLD TO THE FAMISHED SOLDIERS AT EXORBITANT PRICES
3879-173592-0030_8051-295385-0031 LEST THEY SHOULD PAY THE PENALTY OF THEIR EXTORTION THEY WOULD NOT ENTER THE FORT
3879-173592-0031_669-129061-0066 BEYOND GUNSHOT WAITING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS TO COME OUT TO THEM OFTENTIMES SAYS LAUDONNIERE OUR POOR SOLDIERS WERE CONSTRAINED TO GIVE AWAY THE VERY SHIRTS FROM THEIR BACKS TO GET ONE FISH IF AT ANY TIME THEY SHEWED UNTO THE SAVAGES
3879-173592-0032_4362-15663-0001 THE EXCESSIVE PRICE WHICH THEY TOOKE THESE VILLAINES WOULD ANSWERE THEM ROUGHLY AND CHURLISHLY IF THOU MAKE SO GREAT ACCOUNT OF THY MARCHANDISE EAT IT AND WE WILL EAT OUR FISH THEN FELL THEY OUT A LAUGHING AND MOCKED US WITH OPEN THROAT
3879-173592-0034_4859-22176-0011 AND THEY HAD ALSO THE SPANISH BRIGANTINE BROUGHT BY THE MUTINEERS BUT THESE VESSELS WERE INSUFFICIENT AND THEY PREPARED TO BUILD A NEW ONE THE ENERGY OF REVIVING HOPE LENT NEW LIFE TO THEIR EXHAUSTED FRAMES
3879-173592-0038_8108-280359-0007 AND SENT BACK EMPTY HANDED AND HALF STARVED THEY RETURNED TO THE FORT IN THE WORDS OF LAUDONNIERE ANGRY AND PRICKED DEEPELY TO THE QUICKE FOR BEING SO MOCKED
3879-173592-0040_1246-124548-0008 THOSE WHO COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THEIR ARMOR PUT IT ON EMBARKED TO THE NUMBER OF FIFTY IN TWO BARGES AND SAILED UP THE RIVER UNDER LAUDONNIERE HIMSELF HAVING REACHED OUTINA'S LANDING THEY MARCHED INLAND ENTERED HIS VILLAGE
3879-174923-0000_289-121665-0004 THAT HE SHOULD BE ELECTED AND NOW HE DID THINK IT PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD GET THE SEAT ON A PETITION A SCRUTINY USED TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW MADE AS THE SCRUTINY WOULD BE IN THE BOROUGH ITSELF
3879-174923-0001_446-123502-0036 IT WOULD COST BUT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH SHOULD HE KNOCK OFF EIGHT VOTES AND LOSE NONE HIMSELF HE WOULD BE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0003_2989-138035-0027 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE JUDGE BY WHOM ALL THIS WOULD BE DECIDED MIGHT NOT REACH TANKERVILLE IN HIS TRAVELS TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS PERHAPS NOT TILL AFTER EASTER AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT SHOULD HE DO WITH HIMSELF
3879-174923-0008_1963-142393-0025 PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
3879-174923-0009_8629-261140-0029 PERHAPS THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE I THOUGHT MISTER SLIDE AND THE PEOPLE'S BANNER HAD GONE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE BUNCE MISTER SLIDE IS PRETTY WIDE AWAKE WHATEVER SIDE HE'S ON
3879-174923-0013_4481-17498-0014 THE MONEY WOULD COME TO US TO DO AS WE PLEASED WITH IT WE PROVED ALL THAT WHEN WE PARED THEM DOWN A BIT WHAT'S AN ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR A BOX TO PUT THE MONEY INTO TILL YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN
3879-174923-0017_4813-248638-0023 JUST AS HE USED TO DO AND NEVER GOT SO MUCH OUT OF IT
3879-174923-0018_7278-246956-0008 THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT WELL YES THAT IS TRUE MISTER FINN THERE NEVER WAS A MAN BETTER AT BRINGING HOME HIS MONEY TO HIS WIFE THAN BUNCE
3879-174923-0019_3214-167602-0026 IF HE'D DRINK IT WHICH HE NEVER DOES I THINK I'D BEAR IT BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO THAT NASTY UNION AND YOUNG JACK WRITES AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PRETTY NIGH MISTER FINN WHICH IS A COMFORT MISTER BUNCE WAS A JOURNEYMAN SCRIVENER AT A LAW STATIONER'S
3879-174923-0022_1723-141149-0029 NOW LORD CHILTERN WAS AGAIN HIS VERY INTIMATE FRIEND AND THERE HAD USED TO SIT A NEEDY MONEY LENDER WHOM
3879-174923-0023_3699-47246-0000 ALAS ALAS HOW SOON MIGHT HE NOW REQUIRE THAT MONEY LENDER'S SERVICES AND THEN HE RECOLLECTED HOW HE HAD LEFT THESE ROOMS TO GO INTO OTHERS GRANDER AND MORE APPROPRIATE TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD FILLED HIGH OFFICE UNDER THE STATE
3879-174923-0025_412-126975-0015 WHEN THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WOULD HE BE ABLE TO INSERT THE POINT AGAIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DIFFICULT SHELLS WOULD THE COUNTESSES ONCE MORE BE KIND TO HIM WOULD DRAWING ROOMS BE OPENED TO HIM AND SOMETIMES OPENED TO HIM AND TO NO OTHER
3879-174923-0027_7517-100442-0015 HE HAD LEFT ALL THOSE THINGS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AS THOUGH TELLING HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY OFFERED TO HIM BUT WAS HE SURE THAT HE HAD FOUND IT TO BE BETTER HE HAD CERTAINLY SIGHED FOR THE GAUDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT
3879-174923-0033_2817-142371-0076 AS NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOWN NOBODY HAD BEEN ASKED TO MEET HIM IN FORMER DAYS HE HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE IN THAT HOUSE HAVING RECEIVED FROM BOTH OF THEM MUCH KINDNESS MINGLED PERHAPS WITH SOME TOUCH OF SEVERITY ON THE PART OF THE LADY
3879-174923-0034_1578-140049-0021 BUT THE GROUND FOR THAT WAS GONE AND MISSUS LOW WAS NO LONGER PAINFULLY SEVERE A FEW WORDS WERE SAID AS TO HIS GREAT LOSS MISSUS LOW ONCE RAISED HER EYEBROWS IN PRETENDED SURPRISE
3879-174923-0035_4853-29413-0004 WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
3879-174923-0036_2391-145015-0036 AND IF HER HUSBAND COULD NOT BE SAID TO LIVE BY MEANS OF THE SAME ATMOSPHERE IT WAS BECAUSE THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS HAD BEEN DRAWN CHIEFLY IN THE VICE CHANCELLOR'S COURT IN LINCOLN'S INN BUT HE NO DOUBT
3879-174923-0038_32-21631-0012 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
3879-174923-0046_7367-86737-0054 POOR MISSUS LOW WE CAN FORESEE THAT THERE IS MUCH GRIEF IN STORE FOR HER AND SOME ROCKS AHEAD TOO IN THE POLITICAL CAREER OF HER HUSBAND PHINEAS WAS STILL IN LONDON HANGING ABOUT THE CLUBS DOING NOTHING
3879-174923-0051_730-358-0039 ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE AT LAST GOT A PERSON TO DO A DUTY WHICH HAS ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN NEGLECTED VIOLET DOES WRITE
3879-174923-0054_4898-28461-0036 BUT OF HER INSIDE LIFE OF HER BABY OR OF HER HUSBAND AS A HUSBAND SHE NEVER SAYS A WORD YOU WILL HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND HAVE ENOUGH OF THE FEMININE SIDE OF A MAN'S CHARACTER TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME HOW THEY ARE LIVING
3879-174923-0055_2002-139469-0028 I AM SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TOGETHER BECAUSE VIOLET HAS MORE COMMON SENSE THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER KNEW AND PRAY TELL ME ABOUT THE AFFAIR AT TANKERVILLE MY COUSIN BARRINGTON WRITES ME WORD THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET THE SEAT
3879-174923-0057_7859-102519-0010 WE CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT STRONG AGAINST THE CHURCH
3879-174923-0058_1723-141149-0102 BUT IF IT MUST COME WHY NOT BY YOUR HANDS AS WELL AS BY ANY OTHER IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU IN YOUR HEART SHOULD LOVE A PROTESTANT ASCENDANT CHURCH BUT AS BARRINGTON SAYS A HORSE WON'T GET OATS
3879-174923-0060_7517-100429-0012 OR TO REMAIN HERE BY MYSELF BUT HE WILL CONSENT TO NEITHER IN TRUTH THE BURDEN OF IDLENESS HAS NOW FALLEN UPON HIM SO HEAVILY THAT HE CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF HE DREADS THAT HE MAY BE CALLED UPON TO DO ANYTHING
3879-174923-0061_19-198-0030 TO ME IT IS ALL ONE TRAGEDY I CANNOT BUT THINK OF THINGS AS THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS SINCE MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE BOTH IN THE CABINET AND YOU YOUNG AS YOU WERE STOOD BUT ONE STEP BELOW IT OSWALD WAS OUT IN THE COLD HE WAS VERY POOR
3879-174923-0065_405-130894-0059 I COMPLAIN OF NO INJUSTICE OUR CASTLE WAS BUILT UPON THE SAND WHY SHOULD MISTER KENNEDY HAVE BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0067_6818-68772-0018 BY THE GLOOM OF HIS LIFE I SUPPOSE THAT HE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY AT LOUGHLINTER FROM TIME TO TIME I AM IMPLORED BY HIM TO RETURN TO MY DUTY BENEATH HIS ROOF HE GROUNDS HIS DEMAND ON NO AFFECTION OF HIS OWN
3879-174923-0068_1841-159771-0003 ON NO PRESUMPTION THAT ANY AFFECTION CAN REMAIN WITH ME HE SAYS NO WORD OF HAPPINESS HE OFFERS NO COMFORT HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE WITH PROMISES OF FUTURE CARE HE MAKES HIS CLAIM SIMPLY ON HOLY WRIT AND ON THE FEELING OF DUTY WHICH
3879-174923-0071_3240-131231-0004 TO BE ABLE TO TALK AGAIN TO ONE WHO KNOWS ALL THE ERRORS AND ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY PAST LIFE AS YOU DO DRESDEN IS VERY COLD IN THE WINTER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD MIND THAT WE ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ROOMS BUT MY FATHER BEARS THE TEMPERATURE WONDERFULLY WELL

39-121914-0000_3214-167606-0006 EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
39-121914-0002_3664-178355-0034 THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
39-121914-0003_5561-39621-0014 THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
39-121914-0005_8468-294887-0004 IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER

39-121914-0011_1992-141719-0014 WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
39-121914-0015_5104-33406-0051 FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY

39-121914-0017_118-124588-0021 BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH

39-121914-0020_6019-3185-0036 MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT WITH COMPASSION THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION

39-121914-0036_403-128339-0032 IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
39-121914-0038_1743-142913-0004 WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
39-121914-0039_4014-186176-0024 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
39-121914-0040_4088-158077-0086 SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
39-121914-0043_4441-76262-0026 AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
39-121914-0045_669-129061-0054 AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
39-121914-0046_6081-41997-0013 AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
39-121914-0048_125-121124-0001 YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
39-121914-0049_669-129074-0011 AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
39-121914-0052_8123-275209-0000 POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
39-121914-0056_198-209-0010 I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM
39-121915-0000_8425-287387-0030 BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
39-121915-0003_7402-59171-0020 MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
39-121915-0004_7278-91083-0007 AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
39-121915-0007_2384-152900-0045 NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
39-121915-0009_7402-90848-0044 AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
39-121915-0013_3240-131231-0009 ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
39-121915-0015_7447-91186-0018 TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
39-121915-0018_5778-54535-0015 BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
39-121915-0020_311-124404-0072 BUT NEVER ACHIEVED NOW UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION
39-121915-0021_4397-15668-0028 EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
39-121915-0022_6078-54007-0044 WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
39-121915-0024_4397-15678-0033 MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
39-121915-0026_201-127786-0037 BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER
39-121915-0030_4813-248641-0033 TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
39-121915-0032_1743-142913-0025 THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
39-121915-0033_839-130898-0065 BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
39-121916-0000_3983-5331-0015 MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
39-121916-0006_1040-133433-0060 SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
39-121916-0007_8419-286667-0028 AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
39-121916-0009_6078-54013-0027 AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
39-121916-0010_6415-100596-0029 FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER
39-121916-0016_4397-15678-0007 SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
39-121916-0017_4160-11550-0029 AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
39-121916-0018_2514-149482-0083 NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
39-121916-0023_4406-16883-0027 ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
39-121916-0024_87-121553-0045 WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
39-121916-0026_1088-129236-0014 AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
39-121916-0028_1743-142914-0019 MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
39-121916-0030_4195-186236-0013 WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
39-121916-0031_426-122819-0034 AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
3947-13260-0002_8063-274116-0010 I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY MONEY TO HELP THOSE WOMEN TO A BETTER LIFE VIRGINIA LOOKED OVER TO THE END OF THE HALL WHERE THE DAY BEFORE LOREEN'S BODY HAD LAIN I HAVE DECIDED ON A GOOD PLAN AS IT SEEMS TO ME
3947-13260-0006_1116-132847-0026 WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HONESTLY AND WISELY THE MONEY I SHALL PUT INTO THE NEWS IS I AM CONFIDENT IN A LINE WITH HIS PROBABLE ACTION
3947-13260-0007_7794-295948-0024 IT IS AS NECESSARY THAT WE HAVE A CHRISTIAN DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SALOON INFLUENCE TO MEET AS IT IS TO HAVE A CHURCH OR A COLLEGE SO I AM SATISFIED THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT MISTER NORMAN WILL KNOW HOW TO USE SO WELL
3947-13260-0008_446-123501-0012 WILL BE A POWERFUL FACTOR IN RAYMOND TO DO AS JESUS WOULD ABOUT MY OTHER PLAN RACHEL I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH ME
3947-13260-0010_7511-102419-0006 OF CHRISTIAN WORK AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN THE HEART OF GREAT CITY SLUMS I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO TELL JUST WHAT IS THE WISEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN RAYMOND BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH
3947-13260-0013_5192-19397-0033 WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
3947-13260-0014_3983-5371-0032 THE SALOON FURNISHES MATERIAL TO BE SAVED FASTER THAN THE SETTLEMENT OR RESIDENCE OR RESCUE MISSION WORK CAN SAVE IT VIRGINIA SUDDENLY ROSE AND PACED THE HALL RACHEL ANSWERED SADLY AND YET WITH A NOTE OF HOPE IN HER VOICE
3947-13260-0015_2952-407-0018 BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
3947-13260-0018_298-126790-0019 GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF YOUR TRAINING THERE ARE SOME SPLENDID VOICES IN THE ROUGH THERE DID ANY ONE EVER HEAR SUCH SINGING AS THAT YESTERDAY BY THOSE WOMEN RACHEL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
3947-13260-0021_1624-168623-0021 IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED OF DOING HERSELF IT REPRESENTED TO HER SOMETHING THAT SHE FELT WAS IN KEEPING WITH A RIGHT USE OF HER TALENT YES SHE SAID AS SHE ROSE AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0022_254-27760-0018 WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
3947-13260-0025_163-122947-0016 THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13260-0027_3607-135982-0046 I SUPPOSE HE IS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK IS HE GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THIS ONE RACHEL YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUSPECTED JASPER CHASE OF DOING THAT VERY THING IN HIS FIRST STORY VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0028_2092-145709-0019 RACHEL SPOKE WITH THE FRANKNESS THAT HAD ALWAYS EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS JASPER CHASE TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT THAT HE IN FACT HE PROPOSED TO ME OR HE WOULD IF
3947-13260-0033_2817-142371-0057 I THINK PERHAPS IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME AT ANY OTHER TIME THAN THE ONE HE CHOSE I COULD EASILY HAVE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I LOVED HIM BUT NOT NOW AGAIN RACHEL PAUSED SUDDENLY AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AT VIRGINIA AGAIN THERE WERE TEARS ON HER FACE
3947-13260-0034_4813-248641-0020 VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
3947-13260-0036_426-122819-0016 IT WAS EASY FOR THEIR TALK TO SETTLE FINALLY UPON RACHEL BECAUSE OF THE PLACE SHE WAS TO OCCUPY IN THE PLANS WHICH WERE BEING MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT THE RECTANGLE
3947-13260-0037_1898-145715-0039 DID YOU EVER KNOW OF A GIRL OF SUCH REALLY GIFTED POWERS IN VOCAL MUSIC WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER LIFE TO THE PEOPLE AS RACHEL IS GOING TO DO SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS IN THE CITY HAVE PRIVATE PUPILS TO MAKE HER LIVING
3947-13260-0038_1081-125237-0110 AND THEN GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE RECTANGLE THE BENEFIT OF HER CULTURE AND HER VOICE IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SELF SACRIFICE REPLIED ROLLIN A LITTLE STIFFLY VIRGINIA LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE SHARPLY
3947-13260-0040_4788-94904-0021 NEITHER CAN I IMAGINE MISS HE SPOKE THE NAME OF THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL WHO HAD BEGGED VIRGINIA TO TAKE THE GIRLS TO THE RECTANGLE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING VIRGINIA ANY MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE MISTER
3947-13260-0041_1502-122619-0077 VIRGINIA SPOKE THE NAME OF A YOUNG SOCIETY LEADER GOING ABOUT TO THE CLUBS DOING YOUR WORK ROLLIN THE TWO WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE HALL COMING BACK TO RACHEL BEGAN VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0042_226-131532-0033 ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
3947-13260-0046_118-47824-0072 NOW THAT I HAVE A PURPOSE NOW THAT I AM A NEW MAN DON'T YOU SEE VIRGINIA HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING I OWE MY VERY CONVERSION TO RACHEL'S SINGING
3947-13260-0048_2843-152918-0056 ROLLIN WAS SILENT THEN HE WENT ON WITH MORE EMOTION I STILL LOVE HER VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0049_6531-61334-0021 HE STOPPED AND LOOKED HIS SISTER IN THE FACE WITH A SAD SMILE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID VIRGINIA TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOTING ROLLIN'S HANDSOME FACE HIS MARKS OF DISSIPATION NEARLY ALL GONE NOW
3947-13260-0050_1841-159771-0008 THE FIRM LIPS SHOWING MANHOOD AND COURAGE THE CLEAR EYES LOOKING INTO HERS FRANKLY THE FORM STRONG AND GRACEFUL ROLLIN WAS A MAN NOW WHY SHOULD NOT RACHEL COME TO LOVE HIM IN TIME
3947-13262-0004_2952-410-0022 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
3947-13262-0007_4267-72637-0027 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
3947-13262-0008_2911-15084-0001 I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0010_445-123857-0002 YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
3947-13262-0012_40-121026-0044 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
3947-13262-0013_911-130578-0011 THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
3947-13262-0015_1624-142933-0007 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
3947-13262-0016_441-130108-0022 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
3947-13262-0019_226-131532-0020 THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
3947-13262-0023_2952-410-0043 I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0026_7794-295948-0002 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
3947-13262-0029_8630-305212-0002 I FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROL
3947-13262-0033_831-130746-0049 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
3947-13262-0035_6415-116629-0034 AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
3947-13262-0037_4014-186176-0014 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
3947-13262-0039_458-126305-0015 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0041_7312-92432-0009 YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
3947-13262-0045_6848-76049-0021 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
3947-13262-0048_8088-284756-0060 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
3947-13262-0051_445-123860-0011 THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW

40-222-0000_7178-34644-0047 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE

40-222-0006_198-126831-0014 THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
40-222-0009_1737-142397-0016 LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED

40-222-0011_298-126790-0015 AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE

4014-186179-0032_7635-105409-0051 HE WAS A MAN THEY FOUND ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD ALREADY GRIZZLED AND HARDENED BY HIS FIELD EXPERIENCE AND HE KNEW HOW TO CONVEY ORDERS AND TRANSACT BUSINESS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY YOU ARE TO FOLLOW THE RED INK LINES ON THIS MAP HE TOLD LIEUTENANT MACKINSON
4014-186179-0033_332-128985-0047 AS THEY ALL LEANED OVER HIS DESK TO FOLLOW THE TRACING OF HIS PENCIL WITH WHICH HE SHOWED THEM THE COURSE THEY WERE TO TAKE
4014-186179-0038_5163-39921-0003 IT WAS A BLACK NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION THEY DID NOT DARE USE THE FLASHLIGHTS THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED AND FREQUENTLY ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO DROP SUDDENLY FLAT UPON THE GROUND AS A BIG ROCKET WENT UP FROM EITHER SIDE
4014-186179-0043_4441-76250-0003 WHAT DID YOU FALL OVER THE LIEUTENANT FINALLY ASKED OF SLIM IN A SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONE I JUST FOUND IT REPLIED SLIM

4014-186183-0000_4788-94904-0012 FRANK HOSKINS ELBOW WOUND HEALED QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RESULTS AND TOM RAWLE WHO HAD BEEN UNDER TREATMENT AT THE FIELD HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT THE CAMP
4014-186183-0001_200-126784-0015 BUT ON THE EIGHTH DAY A VERITABLE FURY LAUNCHED ITSELF UPON THAT SECTION OF THE AMERICAN FRENCH FRONT IN THE SHAPE OF SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BRIGADES OF BOCHES THAT WERE HURLED OVER THE TOP OF THEIR OWN BREASTWORKS ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND AND UPON THE FIRST LINE TRENCHES OF THE ALLIES
4014-186183-0003_2518-154825-0055 IT WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE THAT SUCH A BATTLE BRINGS
4014-186183-0004_289-121665-0033 AND THEIR HIDDEN ARTILLERY TO THE REAR OF THEM THIS WAS KEPT UP FOR ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AND THE DUEL OF HEAVY GUNS SHOOK THE EARTH LIKE A QUAKE AND WAS DEAFENING THEN JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE INFANTRY ONSLAUGHT
4014-186183-0006_1841-179183-0003 EVERYTHING MOVED LIKE CLOCKWORK AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SPEED AND THROUGHOUT IT ALL MEN ON BOTH SIDES WERE SHOOTING SHOUTING SHRIEKING

4014-186183-0012_1553-140048-0000 THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
4014-186183-0016_7148-82991-0035 SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
4014-186183-0018_5678-43301-0005 WHILE EACH SIDE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS OR ALTERED THEIR PLANS TO MEET THE NEW SITUATION OUR YOUNG FRIENDS WERE BUSY WITH WASH BASIN SOAP AND WATER
4014-186183-0022_1743-142914-0011 AND EVEN THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WELL DESIGNED HOAX
4014-186183-0023_5750-100289-0009 STILL GOING AT MAXIMUM SPEED AND NOW ON A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARD THE AMERICAN SIDE WITHOUT SEEKING A FURTHER HEIGHT THE TAUBE SEVERAL TIMES WAVERED AND A MOMENT LATER ALMOST TURNED OVER BUT THE PILOT RIGHTED HER

4014-186183-0026_2764-36619-0029 AND THE OTHER GERMAN PLANES TURNED BACK TOWARD THEIR OWN LINES THE TAUBE CONTINUED ON ITS WAVERING CRIPPLED DOWNWARD COURSE TOWARD THE ALLIED LINES
4014-186183-0028_7264-92314-0006 OF ITS OWN MOMENTUM IT ROLLED TO WITHIN A TWO MINUTES RUN OF WHERE THE LIEUTENANT AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN STANDING IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF CURIOUS AMERICAN SOLDIERS
4018-103416-0000_587-54108-0044 THE WINTER WHICH PRECEDED THE ENTRANCE OF THE UNITED STATES INTO THE WAR WAS SOCIALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE IT WAS MARKED BY AN ALMOST FEVERISH GAYETY AS THOUGH HAVING APPARENTLY DETERMINED TO PURSUE A POLICY DICTATED PURELY BY SELF INTEREST

403-126855-0004_2384-152900-0034 WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
403-126855-0005_8108-274318-0042 WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0008_8063-274117-0013 SO THERE THEY STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THEY OFTEN HEARD THE KING'S MEN SEARCHING AND TALKING IN THE JUNGLE ROUND ABOUT BUT THEY WERE QUITE SAFE FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THAT HIDING PLACE BUT CHEE CHEE NOT EVEN THE OTHER MONKEYS
403-126855-0009_78-368-0036 AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
403-126855-0011_328-129766-0037 CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
403-126855-0012_6064-56168-0014 AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
403-126855-0014_254-127705-0015 BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
403-126855-0015_909-131041-0014 OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
403-126855-0017_2843-152918-0047 THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
403-126855-0019_6000-55211-0017 HAD HEARD THE NOISE OF THE MONKEYS CHEERING AND THEY AT LAST KNEW WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS AND HASTENED ON TO CATCH HIM THE BIG MONKEY CARRYING GUB GUB WAS COMING ALONG BEHIND SLOWLY
403-126855-0020_322-124147-0076 AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
403-126855-0021_254-145458-0010 COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
403-126855-0022_6454-120342-0033 BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
403-126855-0023_7078-271888-0072 BY THIS TIME THE DOCTOR HAD PICKED HIMSELF UP AND ON THEY WENT AGAIN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND CHEE CHEE SHOUTED IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FAR TO GO NOW
403-126855-0027_426-122819-0021 THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
403-126855-0028_5022-29411-0032 WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
403-126855-0031_6064-56168-0020 MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
403-128339-0001_196-122150-0003 COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
403-128339-0008_441-128988-0025 AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
403-128339-0009_4788-91208-0021 THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
403-128339-0010_78-368-0020 SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
403-128339-0011_2518-154826-0003 BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
403-128339-0012_8419-293469-0015 AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
403-128339-0014_39-121914-0004 WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
403-128339-0017_7302-86814-0029 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0020_201-127786-0045 LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
403-128339-0023_4160-11550-0014 WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
403-128339-0024_2384-152900-0069 HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
403-128339-0025_1334-135589-0038 NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
403-128339-0028_5456-24741-0001 THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
403-128339-0029_7505-258964-0002 BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
403-128339-0030_909-131045-0024 BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
403-128339-0031_8580-287363-0019 SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
403-128339-0033_5867-48852-0096 HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
403-128339-0035_6848-76049-0025 THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
403-128339-0036_7517-100442-0026 OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
403-128339-0037_8629-261139-0008 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0039_2764-36617-0006 TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
403-128339-0040_3486-166446-0001 FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
403-128339-0041_60-121082-0049 THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
403-128339-0042_2391-145015-0057 LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
403-128339-0043_8770-295465-0040 IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
403-128339-0044_6367-74004-0036 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-128339-0046_8975-270782-0036 AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
403-128339-0047_587-54108-0035 SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
403-128339-0048_8095-274345-0024 AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
403-128339-0050_8098-278278-0022 LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
403-128339-0051_8312-279790-0025 NO OTHER MAN IN ALL THIS FRANCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HER FATHER'S BREAST AS SHE HAD LAID HIS POOR HEAD ON HER OWN BREAST LONG LONG AGO HE WAS HAPPY IN THE RETURN HE HAD MADE HER
403-216-0000_5463-39174-0032 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0004_8051-118101-0033 AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0006_696-93314-0046 IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
403-216-0007_909-131045-0040 AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
403-216-0008_5750-100289-0059 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0009_7226-86964-0037 MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
403-216-0010_3699-19402-0027 THE LONGER HE STAYS THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY ABSENCE WILL IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE
403-216-0012_5652-39938-0008 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
403-216-0013_4481-17498-0044 NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
403-216-0016_3242-67153-0008 ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
403-216-0018_2436-2477-0005 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0020_7302-86815-0049 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
403-216-0022_200-126784-0012 AFTER SOME MOMENTS CONSIDERATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS BUT I AM SURE I CANNOT BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
403-216-0023_163-122947-0082 SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
403-216-0024_8324-286683-0016 ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
403-216-0027_6081-41998-0033 HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
405-130894-0000_163-122947-0084 CHAPTER SIXTEEN SHORTAGE OF AIR CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE BELOW AND AROUND THE NAUTILUS THERE WERE IMPENETRABLE FROZEN WALLS WE WERE THE ICE BANK'S PRISONERS THE CANADIAN BANGED A TABLE WITH HIS FEARSOME FIST
405-130894-0001_2196-170379-0004 CONSEIL KEPT STILL I STARED AT THE CAPTAIN HIS FACE HAD RESUMED ITS USUAL EMOTIONLESSNESS HE CROSSED HIS ARMS HE PONDERED THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR THE CAPTAIN THEN BROKE INTO SPEECH GENTLEMEN
405-130894-0002_1926-147987-0008 HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON
405-130894-0005_2514-149482-0053 BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
405-130894-0006_1841-159771-0004 WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
405-130894-0007_229-130880-0045 I'M GOING TO GROUND THE NAUTILUS ON THE LOWER SHELF THEN MY MEN WILL PUT ON THEIR DIVING SUITS AND ATTACK THE THINNEST OF THESE ICE WALLS CAN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE LEFT OPEN WITHOUT ILL EFFECT WE'RE NO LONGER IN MOTION
405-130894-0008_8238-283452-0002 HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
405-130894-0010_5393-19218-0060 HE CAN USE ME ANY WAY HE WANTS HE WON'T TURN DOWN YOUR ASSISTANCE COME ALONG NED I LED THE CANADIAN TO THE ROOM WHERE THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE PUTTING ON THEIR DIVING SUITS I INFORMED THE CAPTAIN OF NED'S PROPOSITION
405-130894-0012_6081-41997-0037 AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE
405-130894-0016_8123-275216-0027 SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
405-130894-0017_1263-141777-0030 THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
405-130894-0019_2989-138028-0025 BUT THIS HARDLY MATTERED SO LONG AS THE LOWER SURFACE KEPT GROWING THINNER AFTER TWO HOURS OF ENERGETIC WORK NED LAND REENTERED EXHAUSTED HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REPLACED BY NEW WORKMEN INCLUDING CONSEIL AND ME
405-130894-0021_5163-39921-0009 AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
405-130894-0022_7402-90848-0048 AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
405-130894-0023_3982-182255-0034 BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
405-130894-0024_3436-172162-0041 EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT
405-130894-0025_8630-305212-0023 WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER
405-130894-0029_254-145458-0017 THE WORK KEPT ME GOING BESIDES WORKING MEANT LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WHICH MEANT BREATHING THE CLEAN OXYGEN DRAWN FROM THE AIR TANKS AND SUPPLIED BY OUR EQUIPMENT WHICH MEANT LEAVING THE THIN FOUL AIR BEHIND
405-130894-0031_6563-63821-0009 THERE WAS NO LACK OF OXYGEN ALL THIS WATER CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
405-130894-0036_6385-34669-0025 A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
405-130894-0038_6454-107462-0022 THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM WE RETURNED ON BOARD MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES
405-130894-0039_3259-158083-0054 OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED
405-130894-0041_198-209-0034 COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
405-130894-0042_8088-284756-0026 I KNOW IT SIR SO WE CAN'T RELY ON NATURE TO RESCUE US ONLY OUR OWN EFFORTS WE MUST COUNTERACT THIS SOLIDIFICATION WE MUST HOLD IT IN CHECK NOT ONLY ARE THE SIDE WALLS CLOSING IN
405-130894-0043_1088-134315-0037 BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
405-130894-0047_4137-11701-0025 IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR
405-130894-0049_3982-178459-0032 IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER REACHED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE IT WAS SENT TO THE PUMPS WHILE NEW WATER REPLACED IT IN THE PROCESS THE HEAT GENERATED BY OUR BATTERIES WAS SO INTENSE THAT AFTER SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MECHANISM WATER DRAWN COLD FROM THE SEA ARRIVED
405-130894-0052_2136-5147-0034 AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
405-130894-0053_5339-14133-0053 THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
405-130894-0057_6209-34600-0004 NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
405-130894-0058_103-1240-0043 TO LEAVE MORE AIR FOR MASTER IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES TO HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS SINCE CONDITIONS INSIDE WERE UNIVERSALLY UNBEARABLE
405-130894-0061_198-126831-0015 WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP HE YIELDED HIS EQUIPMENT TO ANOTHER AND REENTERED THE FOUL AIR ON BOARD ALWAYS CALM UNFLINCHING AND UNCOMPLAINING THAT DAY THE USUAL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVEN GREATER ENERGY

4088-158077-0015_4160-11549-0014 WAS MOST PERPLEXING HERE WERE WE CITIZENS WITHOUT POWER AND RECOGNITION WITH THE ONLY WEAPONS TO WHICH A POWERLESS CLASS WHICH DOES NOT TAKE UP ARMS CAN RESORT WE COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT FIGHT WITH MEN'S WEAPONS
4088-158077-0016_5104-33406-0008 COMPARE THE METHODS WOMEN ADOPTED TO THOSE MEN USE IN THE PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY
4088-158077-0018_4195-186238-0025 WHAT DID WE DO WE CONTINUED TO FIGHT WITH OUR SIMPLE PEACEFUL ALMOST QUAINT DEVICE A BANNER A LITTLE MORE FIERY PERHAPS PERTINENT TO THE LATEST POLITICAL CONTROVERSY BUT STILL ONLY A BANNER INSCRIBED WITH MILITANT TRUTH
4088-158077-0019_4362-15663-0018 JUST AS OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE AT ELECTIONS THE PARTY IN POWER WHICH HAD FAILED TO USE ITS POWER TO FREE WOMEN SO NOW OUR MILITARY STRATEGY WAS BASED ON THE MILITARY DOCTRINE OF CONCENTRATING ALL ONE'S FORCES ON THE ENEMY'S WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0020_3607-135982-0002 AND THE DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME THIS WAS THE UNTENABLE POSITION OF PRESIDENT WILSON AND THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION FROM WHICH WE MUST FORCE THEM TO RETREAT WE COULD FORCE SUCH A RETREAT WHEN WE HAD EXPOSED TO THE WORLD THIS WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0021_3879-173592-0020 JUST AS THE BLUFF OF A DEMOCRATIC CRUSADE MUST BE CALLED SO MUST THE KNIGHT LEADER OF THE CRUSADE BE EXPOSED TO THE CRITICAL EYES OF THE WORLD
4088-158077-0023_5022-29411-0003 IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US IN THAT IT MADE OUR ATTACK MORE DRAMATIC ONE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPECCABLE WAS MORE VULNERABLE IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS UNIVERSAL TRUST AND WORLD WIDE POPULARITY
4088-158077-0024_2764-36616-0027 BUT THIS CONFLICT OF WITS AND BRAINS AGAINST POWER ONLY ENHANCED OUR INGENUITY ON THE DAY THE ENGLISH MISSION HEADED BY MISTER BALFOUR AND THE FRENCH MISSION HEADED BY M VIVIANI VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE WE TOOK THESE INSCRIPTIONS TO THE PICKET LINE
4088-158077-0025_1081-125237-0071 IN OUR CAPACITY TO EMBARRASS MISTER WILSON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION LAY OUR ONLY HOPE OF SUCCESS
4088-158077-0030_2764-36619-0033 PROMISED AN EARLY REPORT TO THE SENATE THERE WERE SCORES OF GAINS IN CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS WERE TUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER TO INTRODUCE SIMILAR SUFFRAGE RESOLUTIONS WE ACTUALLY HAD DIFFICULTY IN CHOOSING THE MAN WHOSE NAME SHOULD STAMP OUR MEASURE
4088-158077-0033_458-126305-0027 THEY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE FROM THE CONVENTION TO CARRY THESE RESOLUTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT THE COMMITTEE INCLUDED MISTER J A H HOPKINS OF THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AS CHAIRMAN
4088-158077-0034_32-21634-0019 MISTER JOHN SPARGO OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY MISTER VIRGIL HINSHAW CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PROHIBITION PARTY AND MISS MABEL VERNON SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY
4088-158077-0035_4214-7146-0040 THE PRESIDENT WAS DEEPLY MOVED INDEED ALMOST TO THE POINT OF TEARS WHEN MISS MABEL VERNON SAID MISTER PRESIDENT THE FEELINGS OF MANY WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BEST EXPRESSED BY YOUR OWN WORDS IN YOUR WAR MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
4088-158077-0040_2952-410-0047 THE AUTHORIZATION OF AN EXPENDITURE OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ERECTION OF A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AS A LEGITIMATE WAR MEASURE IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE PARTISAN ATTITUDE OF THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THE DEBATE
4088-158077-0041_1040-133433-0033 THAT WE WERE ADVANCING TO THAT POSITION WHERE WE WERE AS GOOD POLITICAL MATERIAL TO BE CONTESTED OVER BY OPPOSING POLITICAL GROUPS AS WAS A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AND IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEND SUCH AN ISSUE AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0044_7800-283493-0036 THE PICKETS CONTINUED THEIR VIGIL AND THE MOTION CARRIED STILL UNCERTAIN AS TO THE PURPOSES OF THE REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS WERE MOVED TO FURTHER ACTION
4088-158077-0045_2384-152900-0035 MEETING IN WASHINGTON A FEW DAYS LATER VOTED FOUR TO NINE TO OFFICIALLY URGE UPON THE PRESIDENT THAT HE CALL THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS TOGETHER AND RECOMMEND THE IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION OF THE SUSAN B ANTHONY AMENDMENT THIS ACTION WHICH IN EFFECT REVERSED THE PLANK IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
4088-158077-0047_5163-39921-0006 BUT MERELY REFLECTED THE PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT IT EXTRACTED THE OFFICIAL FLAVOR AND SO OF COURSE NO ACTION FOLLOWED IN CONGRESS AND SO IT WENT LIKE A GREAT GAME OF CHESS
4088-158077-0048_26-495-0072 THE FACT WAS THAT THE PICKETS HAD MOVED THE DEMOCRATS A STEP
4088-158077-0051_911-128684-0075 ALABAMA SOUTH CAROLINA TEXAS MARYLAND MISSISSIPPI AS WELL AS THE WEST MIDDLE WEST NEW ENGLAND AND THE EAST THE STREAM WAS ENDLESS EVERY TIME A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THE WAR TAX BILL
4088-158077-0052_3807-4923-0053 FOOD CONSERVATION OR WHAT NOT WOMEN FROM UNEX PECTED QUARTERS SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT THEIR PROTEST AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF MEASURES SO VITAL TO WOMEN WITHOUT WOMEN'S CONSENT COUPLED WITH AN APPEAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN
4088-158077-0054_5514-19192-0048 IT HAD RALLIED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SUPPORT TO THE AMEND MENT AS A WAR MEASURE AND HAD ITSELF BECOME ALMOST UNIVER SALLY ACCEPTED IF NOT UNIVERSALLY APPROVED AND IN THE MIDST OF PICKETING ANDS IN SPITE OF ALL THE PROPHECIES AND FEARS THAT PICKETING WOULD SET BACK THE CAUSE
4088-158077-0055_587-41619-0009 WITHIN ONE MONTH MICHIGAN NEBRASKA AND RHODE ISLAND GRANTED PRESIDENTIAL SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN THE LEADERS WERE BUSY MARSHALING THEIR FORCES BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S WAR PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED THE CONTROVERSIAL CONSCRIPTION AND ESPIONAGE BILLS THEN PENDING
4088-158077-0056_2416-152139-0026 AND DID NOT RELISH HAVING OUR QUESTION SO VIVID IN THE PUBLIC MIND
4088-158077-0058_6836-76549-0017 THE MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULAR APPROVAL OF SUFFRAGE THE CONSTANT STREAM OF PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AGAINST ITS DELAY NATIONALLY AND THE SHAME OF HAVING WOMEN BEGGING AT ITS GATES COULD RESULT IN ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS
4088-158077-0059_481-123720-0004 THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LITTLE CHOICE IT MUST YIELD TO THIS PRESSURE FROM THE PEOPLE OR IT MUST SUPPRESS THE AGITATION WHICH WAS CAUSING SUCH INTEREST IT MUST PASS THE AMENDMENT OR REMOVE THE TROUBLESOME PICKETS IT DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PICKETS
4088-158077-0060_1963-142776-0004 THE FIRST ARRESTS THE ADMINISTRATION CHOSE SUPPRESSION THEY RESORTED TO FORCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO END PICKETING IT WAS A POLICY DOOMED TO FAILURE AS CERTAINLY AS ALL RESORTS TO FORCE TO KILL AGITATION HAVE FAILED ULTIMATELY
4088-158077-0066_8063-274115-0011 WITH A GREAT LETTERED BANNER WHICH READ TO THE RUSSIAN ENVOYS PRESIDENT WILSON AND ENVOY ROOT ARE DECEIVING RUSSIA WHEN THEY SAY WE ARE A DEMOCRACY HELP US WIN THE WORLD WAR SO THAT DEMOCRACY MAY SURVIVE WE THE WOMEN OF AMERICA
4088-158077-0067_125-121124-0087 TWENTY MILLION AMERI CAN WOMEN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE PRESI DENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THEIR NA TIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE TELL OUR GOVERNMENT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY
4088-158077-0068_6385-220959-0011 RUMORS THAT THE SUFFRAGISTS WOULD MAKE A SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE RUSSIAN MISSION HAD BROUGHT A GREAT CROWD TO THE FAR GATE OF THE WHITE HOUSE A CROWD COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF MEN
4088-158077-0071_2836-5355-0003 CAN BE CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR PROTEST IS THEREFORE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOT WITH THE WOMEN OF AMERICA IF THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME WEAKENS THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158077-0076_6064-300880-0037 NO WAS THE REPLY BUT YOU MUST STOP IT
4088-158077-0077_2092-145706-0020 THE FOLLOWING DAY MISS LUCY BURNS AND MISS KATHERINE MOREY OF BOSTON CARRIED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES WE SHALL FIGHT FOR THE THINGS WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD NEAREST OUR HEARTS FOR DEMOCRACY FOR THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY
4088-158077-0081_27-123349-0039 AS TROPHIES OF THE SPORT THINKING THEY HAD BEEN MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED AND HAVING GROWN WEARY OF THEIR STRENUOUS SPORT THE CROWD MOVED ON ITS WAY TWO SOLITARY FIGURES REMAINED STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK FLANKED BY THE VAST PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
4088-158077-0082_8312-279790-0035 UPON KNOWING THE CHARGE AGAINST THEM MAJOR PULLMAN AND HIS ENTIRE STAFF WERE UTTERLY AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LOOKED AHEAD ONLY AS FAR AS THREATENING ARREST THEY DOUBTLESS THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO
4088-158077-0083_250-142276-0024 AND NEVER BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE FOLLOWING DAY JUNE TWENTY THIRD MORE ARRESTS WERE MADE TWO WOMEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE TWO AT THE CAPITOL ALL CARRIED BANNERS WITH THE SAME WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT THERE WAS NO HESITATION THIS TIME THEY WERE PROMPTLY ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC
4088-158077-0090_8425-246962-0009 CHAMP CLARK AND HIS THRONG WERE NOT MOLESTED THE WOMEN WITH PRACTICALLY A DESERTED STREET WERE ARRESTED AND SERVED JAIL TERMS FOR OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC THE TRIAL OF THIS GROUP WAS DELAYED TO GIVE THE JAIL AUTHORITIES TIME TO VACATE AND TIDY UP
4088-158077-0092_4397-15666-0025 AND WAS NOT THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA A DIRECT APPOINTEE OF THESE SAME COMMISSIONERS AND WAS NOT THE JAIL WARDEN WHO MADE LIFE FOR THE WOMEN SO UNBEARABLE IN PRISON ALSO A DIRECT APPOINTEE OF THE COMMISSIONERS
4088-158077-0094_2136-5140-0007 CHAIRMAN FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE TO ALL NEWSPAPERS POST OFFICES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES OF A PUBLIC CHARACTER FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF OFFICIAL NEWS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WASHINGTON JULY THIRD NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
4088-158077-0096_248-130644-0030 THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN CONCLUDES WITH IT IS A FACT THAT THERE REMAINS IN AMERICA ONE MAN WHO HAS KNOWN EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN TOWARD THE PICKETS
4088-158079-0000_460-172359-0011 AUGUST RIOTS IMPRISONING WOMEN HAD MET WITH CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DISAPPROVAL AND ATTENDANT POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON WOULD END THIS EMBARRASSMENT WAS DOUBTLESS THE HOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158079-0001_4340-15220-0078 THE PICKETS HOWEVER RETURNED TO THEIR POSTS IN STEADILY INCREASING NUMBERS THEIR PRESENCE AT THE GATES WAS DESIRED BY THE ADMINISTRATION NO MORE NOW THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE ARRESTS AND IMPRISONMENTS BUT THEY HAD FOUND NO WAY TO RID THEMSELVES OF THE PICKETS
4088-158079-0002_8095-274345-0027 AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
4088-158079-0005_4214-7146-0080 TWENTY MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT SELF GOVERNED TAKE THE BEAM OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE WE DID NOT EXPECT PUBLIC SYMPATHY AT THIS POINT WE KNEW THAT NOT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD OCCASIONALLY IN DEBATE BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IN THEIR CLOAK ROOMS
4088-158079-0006_3242-67153-0015 PRESIDENT AND MISSUS WILSON PASSED THROUGH THE GATES ON THEIR WAY TO A MILITARY REVIEW AT FORT MYER THE PRESIDENT SAW AMERICAN WOMEN BEING ATTACKED WHILE THE POLICE REFUSED THEM PROTECTION NOT A MOVE WAS MADE BY THE POLICE TO CONTROL THE GROWING CROWD
4088-158079-0007_4267-287369-0022 SUCH INACTION IS ALWAYS A SIGNAL FOR MORE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF ROWDIES AS THE THRONG MOVED TO AND FRO BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OUR HEADQUARTERS IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE SO MANY BANNERS WERE DESTROYED THAT FINALLY MISS LUCY BURNS MISS VIRGINIA ARNOLD
4088-158079-0009_5678-43302-0006 CLIMBED UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR BALCONY MOUNTED THE IRON RAILING AND TORE DOWN ALL BANNERS AND THE AMERICAN FLAG ONE SAILOR ADMINISTERED A SEVERE BLOW IN THE FACE WITH HIS CLENCHED FIST UPON MISS GEORGINA STURGIS OF WASHINGTON WHY DID YOU DO THAT SHE DEMANDED
4088-158079-0010_3436-172171-0038 AND STILL NO ATTEMPT BY THE POLICE TO QUELL THE RIOT THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN IN THE LATE AFTERNOON A BULLET WAS FIRED THROUGH ONE OF THE HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS OF THE SECOND FLOOR EMBEDDING ITSELF IN THE CEILING THE BULLET GRAZED PAST THE HEAD OF MISSUS ELLA MORTON DEAN OF MONTANA
4088-158079-0012_3807-4923-0011 BUT THE POLICE LOOKED ON WHILE ALL THE BANNERS WERE DESTROYED A FEW PACES FROM HEADQUARTERS MORE BANNERS WENT OUT PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD ONES THEY TOO WERE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY REACHED THE WHITE HOUSE
4088-158079-0013_5393-19218-0013 THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE WAS ENACTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE MISS PAUL SUMMED UP THE SITUATION WHEN SHE SAID THE SITUATION NOW EXISTING IN WASHINGTON EXISTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT WILSON PERMITS IT
4088-158079-0014_4137-11701-0003 ASKING QUESTIONS MAKING BRIEF TESTIMONIALS FROM THE FLOOR WITH ALMOST EVANGELICAL FERVOR IMPROVISED COLLECTION BASKETS WERE PILED HIGH WITH BILLS WOMEN VOLUNTEERED FOR PICKET DUTY AND CERTAIN IMPRISONMENT
4088-158079-0016_7635-105409-0037 OUR MASS MEETINGS EVERYWHERE BECAME MEETINGS OF PROTEST DURING THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND RESOLUTIONS OF PROTEST WHICH ALWAYS WENT IMMEDIATELY BY WIRE FROM SUCH MEETINGS TO THE PRESIDENT HIS CABINET AND TO HIS LEADERS IN CONGRESS OF COURSE CREATED INCREASING

412-126975-0006_1926-147979-0010 WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
412-126975-0008_1743-142913-0023 I DID IT IN A GOOD OLD MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE NEAR PUTNEY A HOUSE WITH A CRESCENT OF CARRIAGE DRIVE A HOUSE WITH A STABLE BY THE SIDE OF IT A HOUSE WITH THE NAME ON THE TWO OUTER GATES

412-126975-0013_5322-7680-0026 BUT HER FIGURE WAS BEYOND CONJECTURE FOR SHE WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN BROWN FURS THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS HAIR AND WHICH WAS FUR BUT FOR THE ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SMALL TODDLING BEAR
412-126975-0014_1992-141719-0029 THE WINTER AFTERNOON WAS REDDENING TOWARDS EVENING AND ALREADY A RUBY LIGHT WAS ROLLED OVER THE BLOOMLESS BEDS FILLING THEM AS IT WERE WITH THE GHOSTS OF THE DEAD ROSES

4160-11550-0021_198-126831-0039 THAT FAIRLY MELTED TENDER HEARTED OLD MISS ELIZABETH TO TEARS AND CAUSED HER TO CONFIDE AFTERWARD TO THEO THE FACT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE TENDER PASSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A SINGLE GENTLEMAN OF UNCERTAIN AGE
4160-11550-0024_831-130746-0046 HE WAS THE ONLY LOVER I EVER HAD MY DEAR THEODORA AND HIS NAME WAS ELDERBERRY A VERY SINGULAR NAME BY THE WAY BUT HE WAS A VERY TALENTED MAN WHEN THEO WENT INTO THE LITTLE BACK BEDROOM THAT EVENING TO PUT ON HER HAT PRISCILLA GOWER WENT WITH HER
4160-11550-0025_8425-246962-0025 AND AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE DRESSING TABLE BUTTONING HER SACQUE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY THE EXPRESSION ON HER COMPANION'S FACE PRISCILLA HAD TAKEN UP HER MUFF AND WAS STROKING THE WHITE FUR HER EYES DOWNCAST UPON HER HAND AS IT MOVED TO AND FRO THE RING UPON ITS FOREFINGER SHINING IN THE GASLIGHT
4160-11550-0028_6563-285357-0042 IT WAS A FEELING SCARCELY DEFINED ENOUGH TO ALLOW HER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS REAL PAIN OR ONLY DISCOMFORT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ANY MESSAGE TO SEND SHE REPLIED THANK YOU MISS PRISCILLA SHE TOOK HER MUFF THEN
4160-11550-0031_5463-39173-0002 THE LAST TIME I VISITED THE SPAS MY HEALTH IMPROVED GREATLY IT WAS JUST LIKE HER LADYSHIP TO BECOME SUDDENLY POSSESSED OF A WHIM AND TO FOLLOW ITS LEAD ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CAPRICES AND HER CAPRICES ALWAYS RULED THE DAY AS THIS ONE DID TO THEO'S GREAT ASTONISHMENT
4160-11550-0034_6415-100596-0031 WELL I THINK I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT WE COULD GO NEXT WEEK AND I DARE SAY WE COULD REACH VIENNA BEFORE DENIS OGLETHORPE GOES AWAY THEO BECAME SUDDENLY SILENT SHE GAVE VENT TO NO FURTHER EXCLAMATIONS SHE WOULD ALMOST HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GIVE UP THE PLEASURE OF THE JOURNEY AFTER THAT
4160-11550-0035_4297-13009-0036 SHE WAS LEARNING THAT IT WAS BEST FOR HER NOT TO SEE DENIS OGLETHORPE AGAIN AND HERE IT SEEMED THAT SHE MUST SEE HIM IN SPITE OF HERSELF EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS CONSCIENTIOUS ENOUGH TO WISH TO DO WHAT WAS BEST NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS BEST FOR HERSELF AS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TO PRISCILLA GOWER
4160-11550-0037_1963-142393-0008 SHE HOPED IT MIGHT NEVER REACH HIM AT ALL AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS SHE EXPERIENCED AN ALMOST PASSIONATELY KEEN SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN ON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE LADY THROCKMORTON RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM REGRETTING HIS INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUEST
4160-11550-0039_7067-76048-0044 WITH AN UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENT FEELING OF WRETCHEDNESS I WOULD HAVE STAYED ANYWHERE TO HAVE SEEN HIM ONLY FOR A MINUTE HE HAD NO NEED TO BE SO READY TO GO AWAY
4160-14187-0002_6818-68772-0045 THE VEHICLE DREW NEARER AND AT LENGTH STOPPED OPPOSITE THE HOUSE ON WHICH POLTON SLID DOWN THE STAIRS WITH THE AGILITY OF A HARLEQUIN A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HIS VOICE ASCENDING FROM THE HALL I DO HOPE SIR YOU'RE NOT MUCH HURT
4160-14187-0005_3947-13262-0042 A QUEER AFFAIR JERVIS A VERY ODD AFFAIR INDEED I WAS COMING UP FROM THE BOROUGH PICKING MY WAY MIGHTY CAREFULLY ACROSS THE ROAD ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREASY SLIPPERY MUD AND HAD JUST REACHED THE FOOT OF LONDON BRIDGE WHEN I HEARD A HEAVY LORRY COMING DOWN THE SLOPE A GOOD DEAL TOO FAST
4160-14187-0009_3112-9554-0013 WATCHING MY COLLEAGUE'S FACE WITH SOME EAGERNESS TO SEE WHAT EFFECT THIS NEW INFORMATION WOULD PRODUCE ON HIM THE RESULT WAS ON THE WHOLE DISAPPOINTING HE WAS INTERESTED KEENLY INTERESTED BUT SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF EXCITEMENT
4160-14187-0010_8098-278278-0035 SO JOHN HORNBY HAS BEEN PLUNGING IN MINES EH HE SAID WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AT HIS AGE DID YOU LEARN HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN IN DIFFICULTIES NO BUT IT CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN QUITE SUDDEN AND UNFORESEEN I SHOULD THINK NOT THORNDYKE AGREED
4160-14187-0011_4014-186183-0019 IN WHICH CASE THE DEPRECIATION WOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED HIM IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT MIGHT HAVE A CONSIDERABLE BEARING ON THE PRESENT CASE MIGHT IT NOT UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THORNDYKE IT MIGHT BEAR ON THE CASE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
4160-14187-0012_911-130578-0015 THAT IS WELL CONSIDERED SAID MY COLLEAGUE BUT WHAT IS THE SPECIAL BEARING ON THE CASE SUPPOSING IT WAS SO ON THE SUPPOSITION I REPLIED THAT MISTER HORNBY WAS IN ACTUAL PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES AT THE DATE OF THE ROBBERY IT SEEMS TO ME POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A HYPOTHESIS
4160-14187-0013_426-122822-0031 IN FACT IT IS ALMOST FANTASTIC NEVER MIND THAT SAID HE A SOUND THINKER GIVES EQUAL CONSIDERATION TO THE PROBABLE AND THE IMPROBABLE THUS ENCOURAGED I PROCEEDED TO SET FORTH THE THEORY OF THE CRIME AS IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME ON MY WAY HOME IN THE FOG
4160-14187-0019_332-128985-0045 WAS THE CRIME COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT THAT IS WHERE THE CORROBORATION IS REQUIRED THAT PRACTICALLY LEAVES THE CASE TO BE INVESTIGATED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE FINGER PRINT WHICH THUS BECOMES OF NO IMPORTANCE NOT AT ALL REJOINED THORNDYKE
4160-14187-0020_5867-48852-0026 THE FINGER PRINT IS A MOST VALUABLE CLUE AS LONG AS ITS EVIDENTIAL VALUE IS NOT EXAGGERATED TAKE OUR PRESENT CASE FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT THE THUMB PRINT THE ROBBERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ANYBODY THERE IS NO CLUE WHATEVER
4160-14187-0022_2002-139469-0023 NOW PUTTING ASIDE THE SOME OTHER PERSON FOR CONSIDERATION ONLY IF THE FIRST THREE HYPOTHESES FAIL WE HAVE LEFT REUBEN WALTER AND JOHN BUT IF WE LEAVE THE THUMB PRINT OUT OF THE QUESTION THE PROBABILITIES EVIDENTLY POINT TO JOHN HORNBY
4160-14187-0026_2911-15084-0002 AS TO WALTER HORNBY HE MAY HAVE HAD THE MEANS OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCESS EITHER TO THE DIAMONDS OR TO MISTER HORNBY'S MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4160-14187-0027_6078-54013-0042 THE ACTUAL POINTS AT ISSUE THEN I SAID ARE WHETHER REUBEN HAD ANY MEANS OF OPENING THE SAFE AND WHETHER MISTER HORNBY EVER DID ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK IN BLOOD ON HIS MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4195-17507-0003_26-495-0055 AH BUT THE AMALFI ROAD SIGNORE SURELY YOU WILL SEE THAT
4195-17507-0005_8088-284756-0070 LET US SEE IT INSTANTLY THE CROWD SCAMPERED BACK TO THE SQUARE FOLLOWED MORE LEISURELY BY UNCLE JOHN AND THE GIRLS THERE THE UNIFORMED VETTURIO STOOD BESIDE THE ONE MODERN CARRIAGE IN THE GROUP IT WAS NEW IT WAS GLOSSY
4195-17507-0010_8088-284756-0075 IT DO NOT REMAIN GOOD FOR A LONG RIDE SO I LEAVE HIM HOME FOR I AM KIND I DO NOT WISH THE SIGNORINI BELLA TO TIRE AND WEEP BUT SEE THE FINE VETTURE YOU NOW HAVE IS HE NOT EASY LIKE FEATHERS AN STRONG
4195-17507-0011_7402-90848-0057 IT MAY BE A BIRD BUT IT DON'T LOOK IT SAID UNCLE JOHN DOUBTFULLY
4195-17507-0012_887-123289-0003 HOP IN MY DEARS THEY ENTERED THE CRAZY LOOKING VEHICLE AND FOUND THE SEATS AMPLE AND COMFORTABLE DESPITE THE APPEARANCE OF DILAPIDATION EVERYWHERE PREVALENT THE DRIVER MOUNTED THE BOX CRACKED HIS WHIP AND THE LEAN NAGS AMBLED AWAY AT A FAIR PACE
4195-17507-0013_8098-278278-0015 IT WAS STANDING JUST AS IT HAD BEFORE AND BESIDE IT WAS ANOTHER MAN DRESSED IN THE SPLENDID UNIFORM HIS DRIVER HAD CLAIMED THAT HE HAD LEFT AT HOME
4195-17507-0016_1992-141719-0004 INDEED THE SUN DID COME OUT BUT ONLY TO GIVE A DISCOURAGED LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE AND RETIRE AGAIN
4195-17507-0017_446-123502-0038 THEY HAD SUNSHINE RAIN HAIL SNOW AND A TORNADO AND THEN RAIN AGAIN AND MORE SUNSHINE SUNNY ITALY SEEMED A MISNOMER THAT DAY AS INDEED IT DOES MANY DAYS IN WINTER AND SPRING
4195-17507-0020_6078-54007-0037 EXAGGERATED THE CONDITIONS BY APOSTROPHIZING THE COUNTRY AS SUNNY ITALY AND FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY UTTERED SUCH RHAPSODIES IN ITS PRAISE THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CREDITED THEM UNTIL IT ACQUIRED PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE MATTER
4195-17507-0025_587-41619-0011 AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD THE CLIFFS CONTINUE TO ASCEND A LIKE DISTANCE TOWARD THE SKY
4195-17507-0027_5022-29411-0004 FROM THAT DISTANCE THE BOATS DRAWN UPON THE SHELTERED BEACH SEEMED LIKE MERE TOYS THEN THEY WOULD SPAN A CHASM ON A NARROW STONE BRIDGE OR PLUNGE THROUGH AN ARCH DIVIDING THE SOLID MOUNTAIN
4195-17507-0028_39-121914-0021 WHEN THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE DAY OVERTOOK THEM WITHOUT WARNING THE WIND CAME WHISTLING AROUND THEM IN A GREAT GALE WHICH SPEEDILY INCREASED IN FURY UNTIL IT DROVE THE BLINDED HORSES REELING AGAINST THE LOW PARAPET
4195-17507-0030_8226-274371-0047 AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT A MOUNTED HORSEMAN WHO UNOBSERVED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THE PARTY DASHED TO THEIR RESCUE THE RIDER CAUGHT THE PLUNGING STEEDS BY THEIR HEADS AND TRIED TO RESTRAIN THEIR TERROR AT HIS OWN EMINENT PERIL
4195-17507-0031_2836-5355-0006 WHILE THE CARRIAGE LAY WEDGED AGAINST THE WALL AND THE DRIVER SCREAMED PITIFULLY FROM HIS DANGEROUS POSITION MIDWAY BETWEEN SEA AND SKY
4195-17507-0035_3486-166424-0068 SO OPPORTUNELY WAS NONE OTHER THAN COUNT FERRALTI
4195-17507-0036_446-123502-0027 HE WAS SITTING UPON HIS HORSE AND STARING WITH AMAZEMENT AT BETH

4195-17507-0041_32-21631-0001 AS IF THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN A MOMENT'S FEAR IN THEIR LIVES SO THE GIRLS AND THEIR UNCLE CLIMBED INTO THE VEHICLE AGAIN AND THE DRIVER MOUNTED THE BOX AND CRACKED HIS WHIP WITH HIS USUAL VIGOR
4195-17507-0042_6563-63821-0025 THE WIND HAD SUBSIDED AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD ARISEN AND AS THEY PASSED THROUGH POSITANO WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED FEET HIGH
4195-17507-0044_5104-33407-0046 NOW A HOTEL MUCH FAVORED BY THE TOURIST COUNT FERRALTI PROMISED TO JOIN THEM LATER AND RODE ON TO THE TOWN TO FIND A SURGEON TO LOOK AFTER HIS INJURED HAND WHILE THE OTHERS SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LONG INCLINES LEADING IN A ZIGZAG FASHION UP TO THE OLD MONASTERY
4195-17507-0047_5104-33406-0040 IN SPITE OF HIS COURAGE HE COULD EAT NO LUNCHEON BUT MERELY SIPPED A GLASS OF WINE SO UNCLE JOHN ALARMED AT HIS PALLOR INSISTED THAT HE TAKE A SEAT IN THE CARRIAGE ON THE RETURN JOURNEY
4195-17507-0048_6836-61803-0011 AND BETH MOUNTED THE BOX AND RODE BESIDE HER FRIEND THE DRIVER

4267-287369-0010_8468-294887-0039 IT TOOK THEM THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY TO MAKE A CIRCUIT OF THE BASE OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN IN ORDER TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE A SORT OF TRAIL LED UPWARD IT'S TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING TO NIGHT
4267-287369-0011_4680-16041-0026 MISTER PARKER HE ASKED AS HE SAW THE SCIENTIST TRAMPING A LITTLE WAY UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN I AM GOING TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER AND NO ONE PAID ANY MORE ATTENTION TO HIM FOR SOME TIME

4267-287369-0021_3440-171009-0039 I HOPE LIGHTNING DOESN'T STRIKE AROUND HERE THE STORM CAME ON RAPIDLY BUT THERE WAS A CURIOUS QUIETNESS IN THE AIR THAT WAS MORE ALARMING THAN IF A WIND HAD BLOWN THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY
4267-287369-0023_40-222-0058 IT WAS BLACKER THAN EVER SUDDENLY AS TOM WAS GAZING UP TOWARD THE PEAK OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HE SAW SOMETHING THAT CAUSED HIM TO CRY OUT IN ALARM HE POINTED UPWARD AND WHISPERED HOARSELY
4267-287369-0026_3374-298026-0042 HAD BEEN GROWING LOUDER AND SHARPER INDICATING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THE STORM EACH LIGHTNING FLASH WAS FOLLOWED IN A SECOND OR TWO BY A TERRIFIC CLAP STILL THERE WAS NO WIND NOR RAIN
4267-287369-0027_8051-119902-0004 AND THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CRASH AS IF THE VERY MOUNTAIN HAD SPLIT ASUNDER AND THE ADVENTURERS SAW A GREAT BALL OF PURPLE BLUISH FIRE SHOOT DOWN
4267-287369-0029_78-369-0015 SHOUTING SO AS TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ECHOES OF THE THUNDERCLAP ALMOST AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME ANOTHER EXPLOSION EVEN LOUDER THAN THE ONE PRECEDING A GREAT BALL OF FIRE PEAR SHAPED

4267-78186-0011_5688-41232-0050 THE STRONG FLICKERING LIGHT OF THE FIRE AS IT FELL UPON HER TALL FINE FIGURE AND BEAUTIFUL FACE REVEALED A CREATURE WORTHY OF THE CLOCKMAKER'S COMMENTS GOOD EVENING MARM SAID MISTER SLICK HOW DO YOU DO

4267-78186-0022_229-130880-0006 WHERE THE FIRE WAS NOW BLAZING UP BUT MISTER SLICK PROTESTED HE COULD NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THE LITTLE BOY AND LINGERED BEHIND TO ASCERTAIN HIS AGE AND CONCLUDED BY ASKING THE CHILD IF HE HAD ANY AUNTS THAT LOOKED LIKE MAMA

4297-13006-0000_5463-39173-0022 NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
4297-13006-0002_405-130894-0026 THERE HAD HOWEVER BEEN A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN MISSUS ROBY AND HER NIECE WHICH HAD SERVED TO PREPARE EMILY FOR WHAT WAS COMING LOPEZ HAS BEEN TO YOUR FATHER
4297-13006-0003_6529-62556-0006 IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
4297-13006-0005_4441-76262-0018 MISSUS ROBY WAS PLEASED WITH LITTLE INTRIGUES WAS ADDICTED TO THE AMUSEMENT OF FOSTERING LOVE AFFAIRS WAS FOND OF BEING THOUGHT TO BE USEFUL IN SUCH MATTERS AND WAS NOT AVERSE TO HAVING PRESENTS GIVEN TO HER SHE HAD MARRIED A VULGAR MAN
4297-13006-0006_6531-61334-0024 AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT BECOME LIKE THE MAN SHE HAD BECOME VULGAR SHE WAS NOT AN ELIGIBLE COMPANION FOR MISTER WHARTON'S DAUGHTER A MATTER AS TO WHICH THE FATHER HAD NOT GIVEN HIMSELF PROPER OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING THE FACTS AN AUNT IN HIS CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SO GREAT A COMFORT TO HIM
4297-13006-0007_5703-47198-0050 SO READY AND SO NATURAL AN ASSISTANCE TO HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES BUT EMILY WHARTON WAS NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE HER AUNT NOR HAD MISSUS WHARTON BEEN AT ALL LIKE MISSUS ROBY NO DOUBT THE CONTACT WAS DANGEROUS
4297-13006-0008_4018-107312-0031 INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
4297-13006-0010_7178-34644-0011 WHICH STRANGERS DID NOT FIND ON HER FACE BUT AS WE DO NOT LIGHT UP OUR HOUSES WITH OUR BRIGHTEST LAMPS FOR ALL COMERS SO NEITHER DID SHE EMIT FROM HER EYES THEIR BRIGHTEST SPARKS TILL SPECIAL OCCASION FOR SUCH SHINING HAD ARISEN
4297-13006-0013_6081-41998-0038 OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
4297-13006-0014_4088-158077-0053 WHEN GOING TO MISTER WHARTON AT HIS CHAMBERS HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO CHEAT THE LAWYER INTO ANY ERRONEOUS IDEA ABOUT HIS FAMILY
4297-13006-0017_4267-72637-0020 THAT HE DID LOVE THE GIRL AS WELL PERHAPS AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANY ONE BUT HE HAD FOUND OUT MANY PARTICULARS AS TO MISTER WHARTON'S MONEY BEFORE HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY HAD GATHERED UP HER KNITTING
4297-13006-0018_3240-131232-0040 AND DECLARED AS SHE ALWAYS DID ON SUCH OCCASIONS THAT SHE COULD GO ROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT HAVING ANY ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER
4297-13006-0019_8063-274112-0000 HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
4297-13006-0020_1098-133695-0018 BECAUSE HE IS A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER WOULD YOU HAVE WISHED ME TO TELL HIM THAT HE MIGHT COME YES PAPA HE WAS SITTING ON A SOFA AND SHRANK BACK A LITTLE FROM HER AS SHE MADE THIS FREE AVOWAL
4297-13006-0021_248-130652-0018 IN THAT CASE I COULD HAVE JUDGED FOR MYSELF I SUPPOSE EVERY GIRL WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM I THINK I SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED YOU BEFORE I DID THAT BUT I SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO ACCEPT HIM PAPA I DO LOVE HIM
4297-13006-0022_1455-134435-0034 I HAVE NEVER SAID SO BEFORE TO ANY ONE I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO YOU NOW IF HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO YOU AS HE HAS DONE EMILY IT MUST NOT BE WHY NOT PAPA IF YOU SAY IT SHALL NOT BE SO IT SHALL NOT
4297-13006-0023_1926-147979-0023 I WILL DO AS YOU BID ME THEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND CARESSED HER STROKING DOWN HER HAIR BUT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHY IT MUST NOT BE
4297-13006-0024_6147-34605-0000 HE IS A FOREIGNER BUT IS HE AND WHY SHOULD NOT A FOREIGNER BE AS GOOD AS AN ENGLISHMAN HIS NAME IS FOREIGN BUT HE TALKS ENGLISH AND LIVES AS AN ENGLISHMAN HE HAS NO RELATIVES NO FAMILY NO BELONGINGS
4297-13006-0029_4640-19187-0005 I WOULD NOT WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH ASKING IF THERE HAS BEEN INTIMACY BETWEEN YOU SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE COME NATURALLY AS A THING OF COURSE YOU HAVE MADE HIM NO PROMISE OH NO PAPA
4297-13006-0030_1963-142776-0030 NOR SPOKEN TO HIM OF YOUR REGARD FOR HIM NEVER NOT A WORD NOR HE TO ME EXCEPT IN SUCH WORDS AS ONE UNDERSTANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOTHING I WISH HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOU IS HE A BAD MAN PAPA
4297-13006-0032_911-128684-0048 THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRM AGAINST HER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BECOMES YOU TO ASK YOUR FATHER SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR MY CHILDREN I AM SURE IT IS
4297-13006-0034_8312-279791-0011 SHE HAD ALREADY PROFESSED HERSELF WILLING TO SUBMIT TO HER FATHER'S JUDGMENT AND DID NOT NOW BY ANY MEANS CONTEMPLATE REBELLION AGAINST PARENTAL AUTHORITY BUT SHE DID FEEL THAT ON A MATTER SO VITAL TO HER
4297-13006-0036_6367-65536-0017 ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
4297-13006-0041_8580-287363-0014 I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I PROMISE NOT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION I DO BELIEVE YOU OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU BUT IF I DO THAT FOR YOU PAPA I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY SURE ON MY ACCOUNT
4297-13006-0042_3112-9555-0053 I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
4297-13006-0043_2843-152918-0072 HE WAS AS CONVINCED AS EVER THAT UNLESS THERE WAS MUCH TO CONCEAL THERE WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH CONCEALMENT BUT A FEELING BEGAN TO GROW UPON HIM ALREADY THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD A MODE OF PLEADING WITH HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO RESIST
4297-13009-0000_6529-62554-0034 THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
4297-13009-0002_298-126791-0012 FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
4297-13009-0004_3235-28433-0023 OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
4297-13009-0005_83-11691-0012 MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
4297-13009-0006_6415-100596-0011 AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
4297-13009-0007_19-227-0035 HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
4297-13009-0010_3436-172162-0039 TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
4297-13009-0013_8312-279790-0031 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0014_328-129766-0043 WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
4297-13009-0018_6209-34599-0027 AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
4297-13009-0019_3830-12535-0021 AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
4297-13009-0022_7402-59171-0021 BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
4297-13009-0023_5463-39174-0010 AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
4297-13009-0030_4640-19188-0037 FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM

4362-15663-0003_3699-47246-0006 THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
4362-15663-0004_3947-13262-0014 IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES

4362-15663-0008_78-368-0048 AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
4362-15663-0009_1963-147036-0028 AND MANY WERE THE INTERROGATIONS CONCERNING MY RAMBLE WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS SIMPLY TAKING A WALK AND THAT ICY SHASTA WAS MY MARK I WAS INVARIABLY ADMONISHED THAT I HAD COME ON A DANGEROUS QUEST THE TIME WAS FAR TOO LATE
4362-15663-0010_1723-141149-0073 THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE

4362-15663-0013_481-123719-0005 AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
4362-15663-0014_1970-10594-0017 THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
4362-15663-0015_4195-186237-0029 THE SNOW OF COURSE GROWING STEADILY DEEPER AND LOOSER SO THAT WE HAD TO BREAK A TRAIL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO GET DISCOURAGED AND AFTER NIGHT AND DARKNESS CAME ON THEY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A BED OF ROUGH LAVA
4362-15663-0016_40-121026-0023 WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES

4362-15663-0023_8468-294887-0010 THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
4362-15663-0024_4340-15220-0086 I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
4362-15663-0025_2289-152253-0029 THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
4362-15663-0026_8425-291444-0011 THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
4362-15663-0030_446-123501-0041 DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
4362-15663-0031_125-121342-0040 I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
4362-15663-0032_2764-36619-0028 HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
4362-15663-0035_19-198-0012 THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
4362-15663-0042_7278-91083-0017 A DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAME FRISKING FROM THE FOOT OF A CLUMP OF DWARF PINES MOVING IN SUDDEN INTERRUPTED SPURTS OVER THE BOSSY SNOW THEN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT GUIDANCE HE WOULD DIG RAPIDLY INTO THE DRIFT WHERE WERE BURIED SOME GRAINS OF BARLEY THAT THE HORSES HAD LEFT
4362-15663-0043_4088-158077-0087 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL DOES NOT STRICTLY BELONG TO THESE UPPER WOODS AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM OUT IN SUCH WEATHER THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP ALSO QUITE A LARGE FLOCK OF THEM CAME TO MY CAMP AND TOOK SHELTER BESIDE A CLUMP OF MATTED DWARF PINES
4362-15663-0046_4137-11702-0040 THE DAY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO ASCENTS BEING DEVOTED TO ESTABLISHING A CAMP ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TIMBERLINE HERE ON OUR RED TRACHYTE BED WE OBTAINED TWO HOURS OF SHALLOW SLEEP BROKEN FOR OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE KEEN STARRY NIGHT
4362-15663-0047_7800-283493-0017 AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
4362-15663-0049_911-128684-0000 AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
4362-15663-0050_200-124140-0012 PROBABLY INFLUENCED SOMEWHAT BY RADIATION FROM THE SUN WARMED CLIFFS A COMMON BUMBLEBEE NOT AT ALL BENUMBED ZIGZAGGED VIGOROUSLY ABOUT OUR HEADS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE NEAREST HONEY FLOWER WAS A MILE BENEATH HIM
4362-15663-0053_481-123720-0073 THE MODOC LAVA BEDS MANY A SNOW LADEN PEAK FAR NORTH IN OREGON THE SCOTT AND TRINITY AND SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA THE BLUE COAST RANGE SHASTA VALLEY THE DARK FORESTS FILLING THE VALLEY OF THE SACRAMENTO
4362-15663-0054_5688-41232-0033 THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
4362-15663-0055_8797-294123-0056 ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
4362-15663-0058_6836-61803-0038 SUGGESTING TO US THE IDEA OF AT ONCE SEEKING OUR SAFE CAMP IN THE TIMBER AND ABANDONING THE PURPOSE OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BAROMETER AT THREE P M TWO HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE
4362-15663-0059_7367-86737-0002 WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
4362-15663-0060_2514-149482-0037 WE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PASS THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT BUT ANXIETY TO COMPLETE MY OBSERVATIONS STIFLED MY OWN INSTINCTIVE PROMPTINGS TO RETREAT AND HELD ME TO MY WORK NO INEXPERIENCED PERSON WAS DEPENDING ON ME
4362-15663-0061_2092-145706-0056 AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
4362-15663-0063_302-123516-0000 THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
4362-15663-0065_1963-142776-0022 THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
4362-15663-0066_2391-145015-0107 YET SEEMINGLY THROWN AWAY ON THOSE DESOLATE CRAGS DOWN WHICH THEY WENT ROLLING FALLING SLIDING IN A NETWORK OF CURIOUS STREAMS AFTER WE HAD FORCED OUR WAY DOWN THE RIDGE AND PAST THE GROUP OF HISSING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0069_250-142286-0021 STROKE FOLLOWING STROKE IN QUICK PASSIONATE SUCCESSION AS THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN WERE BEING RENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND THE FIRES OF THE OLD VOLCANO WERE BREAKING FORTH AGAIN COULD WE AT ONCE HAVE BEGUN TO DESCEND THE SNOW SLOPES LEADING TO THE TIMBER
4362-15663-0074_839-130898-0050 AFTER WAITING AND WATCHING IN VAIN FOR SOME FLAW IN THE STORM THAT MIGHT BE URGED AS A NEW ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF ATTEMPTING THE DESCENT I WAS COMPELLED TO FOLLOW HERE SAID JEROME AS WE SHIVERED IN THE MIDST OF THE HISSING SPUTTERING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0076_6531-61334-0099 BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
4362-15663-0078_3807-4923-0040 WHEN THE BLOOM OF THE SHASTA CHAPARRAL IS FALLING THE GROUND IS SOMETIMES COVERED FOR HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES TO A DEPTH OF HALF AN INCH BUT THE BLOOM OF THIS FERTILE SNOW CLOUD GREW AND MATURED AND FELL TO A DEPTH OF TWO FEET IN A FEW HOURS
4362-15663-0081_1553-140047-0037 AND THE FINENESS OF THAT TOUCH NONE WILL FORGET BUT THE STORM BLAST LADEN WITH CRISP SHARP SNOW SEEMS TO CRUSH AND BRUISE AND STUPEFY WITH ITS MULTITUDE OF STINGS AND COMPELS THE BRAVEST TO TURN AND FLEE
4362-15663-0086_302-123523-0026 EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
4362-15663-0090_8098-278278-0014 IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
4362-15663-0091_8747-293952-0084 SHINING WITH MARVELOUS BRIGHTNESS WITH LONG LANCE RAYS NEAR LOOKING AND NEW LOOKING AS IF NEVER SEEN BEFORE AGAIN THEY WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR AND REMIND US OF STARGAZING AT HOME OFTENTIMES IMAGINATION COMING INTO PLAY
4362-15663-0093_5104-33407-0025 IN ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS EVERY HOUR LIKE A YEAR DAY BEGAN TO DAWN BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE SUMMIT'S ROCKS WERE TOUCHED BY THE SUN NO CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM WHERE WE LAY YET THE MORNING WAS DULL AND BLUE AND BITTERLY FROSTY
4362-15663-0094_1081-125237-0105 AND HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY WHILE WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE PALE LIGHT STEALING DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE HOLLOW WHERE WE LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THAT WARM FLUSHING SUNRISE SPLENDOR WE SO LONG HAD HOPED FOR
4362-15663-0095_78-369-0027 AS THE TIME DREW NEAR TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO REACH CAMP WE BECAME CONCERNED TO KNOW WHAT STRENGTH WAS LEFT US AND WHETHER OR NO WE COULD WALK FOR WE HAD LAIN FLAT ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT ONCE RISING TO OUR FEET
4362-15663-0101_4441-76263-0019 THAT WE CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT EATING BUT WE EAGERLY DRANK THE COFFEE HE PREPARED FOR US OUR FEET WERE FROZEN AND THAWING THEM WAS PAINFUL AND HAD TO BE DONE VERY SLOWLY BY KEEPING THEM BURIED IN SOFT SNOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS
4362-15663-0102_909-131044-0010 WHICH AVOIDED PERMANENT DAMAGE FIVE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT WE FOUND ONLY THREE INCHES OF NEW SNOW AND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN ONLY A SLIGHT SHOWER OF RAIN HAD FALLEN SHOWING HOW LOCAL OUR STORM HAD BEEN
4362-15663-0104_4160-11550-0003 HOW BEAUTIFUL SEEMED THE GOLDEN SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE WOODS BETWEEN THE WARM BROWN BOLES OF THE CEDARS AND PINES ALL MY FRIENDS AMONG THE BIRDS AND PLANTS SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS AND WE FELT LIKE SPEAKING TO EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE PASSED
4397-15666-0001_2952-407-0021 ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS SMALL LOCAL STORMS HAVE BEEN FALLING ON THE WAHSATCH AND OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WHILE THE JORDAN VALLEY REMAINED DRY AND SUN FILLED BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH ULTIMO
4397-15666-0005_125-121124-0030 POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
4397-15666-0006_2289-152254-0008 WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
4397-15666-0007_2002-139469-0072 AND THEIR MARVELOUS PROFUSION OF ORNATE SCULPTURE WERE MOST IMPRESSIVELY MANIFEST ONE WOULD FANCY THAT A MAN MIGHT BE CLEARLY SEEN WALKING ON THE SNOW AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WHILE WE WERE REVELING IN THIS RARE UNGARISH GRANDEUR
4397-15666-0008_2002-139469-0075 TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
4397-15666-0009_8770-295463-0008 WHOSE SMOOTH LINEAR STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO FALL OF THESE PARTIAL STORMS THERE WERE SOON TEN OR TWELVE ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS WHILE THE MAIN JORDAN VALLEY BETWEEN THEM LAY AS YET IN PROFOUND CALM AT FOUR THIRTY P M
4397-15666-0011_1743-142914-0008 EXCITED OUR ATTENTION WITHOUT ENABLING US TO DECIDE CERTAINLY AS TO ITS CHARACTER BUT WE WERE NOT LEFT LONG IN DOUBT FOR IN A FEW MINUTES IT CAME SWEEPING OVER THE VALLEY IN A WILD UPROAR A TORRENT OF WIND THICK WITH SAND AND DUST
4397-15666-0012_481-123719-0026 ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
4397-15666-0014_4406-16882-0029 THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
4397-15666-0015_163-122947-0077 MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
4397-15666-0018_3436-172171-0026 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
4397-15666-0023_6437-66173-0006 BUT NOTHING COMPARABLE WITH THIS I FELT AS IF NEW ARRIVED IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF WORLD THE MOUNTAINS THE PLAINS THE SKY ALL SEEMED NEW OTHER EXPERIENCES SEEMED BUT TO HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS AS SOULS ARE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN
4397-15666-0024_1737-142396-0011 TRAILED THEIR LUSTROUS FRINGES THROUGH THE PINES AS IF TAKING A LAST VIEW OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHED WORK THEN CAME DARKNESS AND THE GLORIOUS DAY WAS DONE
4397-15668-0000_5561-39621-0019 YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
4397-15668-0005_27-123349-0026 AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
4397-15668-0008_831-130739-0031 AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
4397-15668-0011_211-122442-0052 I WAS ANIMATED BY A MOUNTAINEER'S EAGERNESS TO GET MY FEET INTO THE SNOW ONCE MORE AND MY HEAD INTO THE CLEAR SKY AFTER LYING DORMANT ALL WINTER AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT IN EVERY WALK WITH NATURE ONE RECEIVES FAR MORE THAN HE SEEKS
4397-15668-0015_2836-5354-0013 ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
4397-15668-0017_3436-172171-0045 AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
4397-15668-0019_7800-283492-0015 THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
4397-15668-0020_2159-179157-0031 PUSHING ON UP THE RUGGED SLOPES I FOUND MANY DELIGHTFUL SECLUSIONS MOIST NOOKS AT THE FOOT OF CLIFFS AND LILIES IN EVERY ONE OF THEM NOT GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE DAISIES BUT WELL APART WITH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEIR BELLS TO SWING FREE AND RING
4397-15668-0021_125-121124-0044 I FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM IN FULL BLOOM WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE SNOW IN WINTER ONLY THE BULBS ARE ALIVE SLEEPING DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND LIKE FIELD MICE IN THEIR NESTS THEN THE SNOW FLOWERS FALL ABOVE THEM LILIES OVER LILIES
4397-15668-0023_2196-170151-0012 AND AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET I CAME UPON THE FRESH TRAIL OF A FLOCK OF WILD SHEEP SHOWING THAT THESE FINE MOUNTAINEERS STILL FLOURISH HERE ABOVE THE RANGE OF MORMON RIFLES IN THE PLANTING OF HER WILD GARDENS
4397-15668-0027_198-209-0017 AND THE WIDE PRAIRIE OF WATER GLOWING IN THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF EVENING PRESENTED ALL THE COLORS THAT TINT THE LIPS OF SHELLS AND THE PETALS OF LILIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE THIS SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS UTAH LAKE
4397-15668-0032_8425-246962-0021 ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
4397-15668-0034_7402-90848-0004 FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
4397-15668-0037_233-134440-0033 SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
4397-15668-0038_328-129766-0063 HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
4397-15668-0039_32-4137-0048 HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
4397-15678-0001_8051-118101-0006 A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0003_2691-156755-0010 HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
4397-15678-0004_887-123290-0026 OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005_7226-86964-0001 UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0006_6531-61334-0017 AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
4397-15678-0008_3214-167602-0029 TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0012_2514-149482-0065 AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
4397-15678-0013_8580-287363-0007 SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014_7067-76047-0034 AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0016_3112-9555-0010 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0019_7302-86814-0048 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020_481-123720-0060 RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0026_6848-252323-0024 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0028_1235-135883-0041 AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029_32-4137-0008 GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0030_2196-170379-0010 THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4397-15678-0031_5456-24741-0012 HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0034_1447-130550-0009 MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035_1723-141149-0003 STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0036_441-130108-0016 BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
4397-15678-0038_4267-72637-0022 THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0039_8465-246940-0008 SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
4397-15678-0042_5808-54425-0036 WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
4397-15678-0043_5393-19218-0001 THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
4406-16882-0001_1088-134315-0039 BUT OUT WE MUST GO THE FIRE INCREASING AND COMING ALONG BEHIND US ROARING AND THE INDIANS GAPING BEFORE US WITH THEIR GUNS SPEARS AND HATCHETS TO DEVOUR US
4406-16882-0003_6476-57446-0030 THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
4406-16882-0004_4051-11217-0026 STANDING AMAZED WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN TO OUR HEELS MY ELDEST SISTER BEING YET IN THE HOUSE AND SEEING THOSE WOEFUL SIGHTS THE INFIDELS HAULING MOTHERS ONE WAY AND CHILDREN ANOTHER AND SOME WALLOWING IN THEIR BLOOD
4406-16882-0005_1926-143879-0003 AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
4406-16882-0008_3526-176653-0032 AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
4406-16882-0009_4362-15663-0070 AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
4406-16882-0010_5703-47212-0005 I SHOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO BE KILLED BY THEM THAN TAKEN ALIVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL MY MIND CHANGED THEIR GLITTERING WEAPONS SO DAUNTED MY SPIRIT THAT I CHOSE RATHER TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE AS I MAY SAY RAVENOUS BEASTS
4406-16882-0011_4788-294466-0006 THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
4406-16882-0012_2989-138035-0053 WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
4406-16882-0017_6531-61334-0020 AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY
4406-16882-0018_2391-145015-0062 BY ONE EYED JOHN AND MARLBOROUGH'S PRAYING INDIANS WHICH CAPTAIN MOSELY BROUGHT TO BOSTON AS THE INDIANS TOLD ME THE SECOND REMOVE BUT NOW THE NEXT MORNING I MUST TURN MY BACK UPON THE TOWN AND TRAVEL WITH THEM INTO THE VAST AND DESOLATE WILDERNESS
4406-16882-0020_5652-39938-0033 THAT IT DID NOT QUITE FAIL ONE OF THE INDIANS CARRIED MY POOR WOUNDED BABE UPON A HORSE IT WENT MOANING ALL ALONG I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I WENT ON FOOT AFTER IT WITH SORROW THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED AT LENGTH I TOOK IT OFF THE HORSE
4406-16882-0021_302-123516-0025 AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
4406-16882-0023_1034-121119-0000 BY A LITTLE FIRE AND A FEW BOUGHS BEHIND ME WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY LAP
4406-16882-0025_4018-107312-0004 AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT MORNING THE THIRD REMOVE
4406-16882-0026_4853-29413-0014 ONE OF THE INDIANS GOT UP UPON A HORSE AND THEY SET ME UP BEHIND HIM WITH MY POOR SICK BABE IN MY LAP A VERY WEARISOME AND TEDIOUS DAY I HAD OF IT WHAT WITH MY OWN WOUND AND MY CHILD'S BEING SO EXCEEDING SICK AND IN A LAMENTABLE CONDITION WITH HER WOUND
4406-16882-0031_441-128982-0035 THERE WAS NO RESISTING BUT GO I MUST AND LEAVE IT WHEN I HAD BEEN AT MY MASTER'S WIGWAM
4406-16882-0036_4014-186183-0029 AND YE WILL TAKE BENJAMIN ALSO ALL THESE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME
4406-16882-0040_3112-9555-0045 ALL THE COMPANY FOR THOSE THAT BELONGED TO THE OTHER SMALL COMPANY CAME THROUGH THE TOWN THAT NOW WE WERE AT BUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO US OH THE OUTRAGEOUS ROARING AND HOOPING THAT THERE WAS THEY BEGAN THEIR DIN ABOUT A MILE BEFORE THEY CAME TO US
4406-16882-0041_289-121665-0032 BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
4406-16882-0044_5456-24741-0013 AND TURN ALL THOSE CURSES UPON OUR ENEMIES I DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE TO FORGET THIS SCRIPTURE AND WHAT COMFORT IT WAS TO ME NOW
4406-16882-0047_7264-92316-0015 I WISHED HER NOT TO RUN AWAY BY ANY MEANS FOR WE WERE NEAR THIRTY MILES FROM ANY ENGLISH TOWN
4406-16882-0048_669-129074-0001 AND ANOTHER CHILD IN HER ARMS TWO YEARS OLD AND BAD RIVERS THERE WERE TO GO OVER AND WE WERE FEEBLE WITH OUR POOR AND COARSE ENTERTAINMENT I HAD MY BIBLE WITH ME I PULLED IT OUT AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD READ
4406-16882-0050_831-130739-0000 SHE WOULD BE OFTEN ASKING THE INDIANS TO LET HER GO HOME THEY NOT BEING WILLING TO THAT AND YET VEXED WITH HER IMPORTUNITY GATHERED A GREAT COMPANY TOGETHER ABOUT HER AND STRIPPED HER NAKED AND SET HER IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG AND DANCED ABOUT HER IN THEIR HELLISH MANNER
4406-16882-0053_3242-67168-0017 WE CAME ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON TO THIS PLACE COLD AND WET AND SNOWY AND HUNGRY AND WEARY AND NO REFRESHING FOR MAN BUT THE COLD GROUND TO SIT ON AND OUR POOR INDIAN CHEER
4406-16882-0055_839-130898-0062 AND THEN THEY MADE A STOP AND CHOSE SOME OF THEIR STOUTEST MEN AND SENT THEM BACK TO HOLD THE ENGLISH ARMY IN PLAY WHILST THE REST ESCAPED AND THEN LIKE JEHU THEY MARCHED ON FURIOUSLY WITH THEIR OLD AND WITH THEIR YOUNG SOME CARRIED THEIR OLD DECREPIT MOTHERS
4406-16882-0057_6081-41997-0001 UPON A FRIDAY A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THIS RIVER
4406-16882-0058_5393-19218-0027 AND WERE GATHERED TOGETHER I THOUGHT TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF THEM BUT THEY WERE SO MANY AND BEING SOMEWHAT IN MOTION IT WAS BEYOND MY SKILL IN THIS TRAVEL BECAUSE OF MY WOUND I WAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED IN MY LOAD I CARRIED ONLY MY KNITTING WORK AND TWO QUARTS OF PARCHED MEAL
4406-16882-0059_3983-5331-0013 BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
4406-16882-0060_7517-100437-0017 WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
4406-16882-0061_4441-76262-0009 THE FIRST WEEK OF MY BEING AMONG THEM I HARDLY ATE ANY THING THE SECOND WEEK I FOUND MY STOMACH GROW VERY FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMETHING AND YET IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET DOWN THEIR FILTHY TRASH BUT THE THIRD WEEK
4406-16882-0063_6181-216552-0047 THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
4406-16882-0064_2989-138028-0016 IF WE HAD BEEN GOD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THE ENGLISH TO HAVE PASSED THIS RIVER AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIANS WITH THEIR SQUAWS AND CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR LUGGAGE OH THAT MY PEOPLE HAD HEARKENED TO ME AND ISRAEL HAD WALKED IN MY WAYS
4406-16882-0066_4441-76263-0034 WE CAME THAT DAY TO A GREAT SWAMP BY THE SIDE OF WHICH WE TOOK UP OUR LODGING THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE SWAMP I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN COME TO A GREAT INDIAN TOWN
4406-16882-0067_5678-43301-0026 THOUGH THERE WERE NONE BUT OUR OWN COMPANY THE INDIANS WERE AS THICK AS THE TREES IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A THOUSAND HATCHETS GOING AT ONCE IF ONE LOOKED BEFORE ONE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT INDIANS AND BEHIND ONE NOTHING BUT INDIANS
4406-16882-0068_3526-175658-0028 AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
4406-16883-0002_2136-5147-0030 EVEN AS THE PSALMIST SAYS TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND HIS WONDERFUL POWER IN CARRYING US ALONG PRESERVING US IN THE WILDERNESS WHILE UNDER THE ENEMY'S HAND AND RETURNING OF US IN SAFETY AGAIN AND HIS GOODNESS
4406-16883-0007_6019-3185-0031 THEN CAME ONE OF THEM AND GAVE ME TWO SPOONFULS OF MEAL TO COMFORT ME AND ANOTHER GAVE ME HALF A PINT OF PEAS WHICH WAS MORE WORTH THAN MANY BUSHELS AT ANOTHER TIME THEN I WENT TO SEE KING PHILIP HE BADE ME COME IN AND SIT DOWN
4406-16883-0009_4160-14187-0000 IT SEEMS TO BE A BAIT THE DEVIL LAYS TO MAKE MEN LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME
4406-16883-0011_1098-133695-0020 WHEREUPON THEY FELL TO BOILING OF GROUND NUTS AND PARCHING OF CORN
4406-16883-0013_6476-57446-0068 AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAP FOR HIS BOY FOR WHICH HE INVITED ME TO DINNER I WENT AND HE GAVE ME A PANCAKE ABOUT AS BIG AS TWO FINGERS IT WAS MADE OF PARCHED WHEAT BEATEN AND FRIED IN BEAR'S GREASE
4406-16883-0014_5104-33406-0060 AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
4406-16883-0016_5163-18515-0020 I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
4406-16883-0018_5867-48852-0005 I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
4406-16883-0020_8609-283227-0017 BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING
4406-16883-0024_8312-279791-0010 I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
4406-16883-0025_4680-16042-0022 AND THEN I RETURNED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNED I FOUND MYSELF AS UNSATISFIED AS I WAS BEFORE
4406-16883-0029_298-126790-0004 BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
4406-16883-0032_1263-139804-0005 I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
4406-16883-0034_2691-156745-0011 AND WOULD HAVE HAD HIM GONE BACK ALSO BUT HE WOULD NOT BUT SAID HE WOULD GO ON AND COME TO US AGAIN IN THREE DAYS MY SPIRIT WAS UPON THIS I CONFESS VERY IMPATIENT AND ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS
4406-16883-0036_374-180299-0038 WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN
4406-16883-0038_441-128982-0030 WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
4406-16883-0040_87-121553-0028 AND A GOOD FIRE WE HAD AND THROUGH THE GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD I HAD A COMFORTABLE LODGING THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING ANOTHER INDIAN BADE ME COME AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD GIVE ME SIX GROUND NUTS WHICH I DID
4406-16883-0042_1363-135842-0021 BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
4406-16883-0043_2952-410-0041 WHERE WE ABODE ALMOST A FORTNIGHT HERE ONE ASKED ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HER PAPOOSE FOR WHICH SHE GAVE ME A MESS OF BROTH WHICH WAS THICKENED WITH MEAL MADE OF THE BARK OF A TREE AND TO MAKE IT THE BETTER
4406-16883-0045_1841-179183-0037 AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM
4406-16883-0046_5322-7678-0003 AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT
4406-16883-0047_8324-286682-0024 THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME
4406-16883-0048_6147-34606-0008 YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB
4406-16883-0050_6529-62554-0012 BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED
4406-16883-0051_8014-112602-0026 I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
4406-16883-0054_887-123289-0002 HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE
4406-16883-0055_8629-261139-0038 THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE
4406-16883-0056_5339-14133-0052 AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
441-128982-0000_7780-274562-0101 WHEN THE LITTLE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ AND HIS MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CAMPEACHY THEY MET WITH VERY STORMY WEATHER SO THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THE SHIP WHICH CONTAINED BARTHOLEMY AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PORT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND
441-128982-0004_2002-139469-0036 AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
441-128982-0007_7148-7763-0008 BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
441-128982-0009_8123-275209-0005 AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
441-128982-0010_3168-173565-0027 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
441-128982-0011_5339-14133-0002 HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
441-128982-0012_7302-86814-0013 THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
441-128982-0013_5688-15787-0001 THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
441-128982-0014_4680-16042-0025 FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
441-128982-0016_7113-86041-0074 AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
441-128982-0017_322-124146-0030 WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
441-128982-0020_6848-76049-0003 WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
441-128982-0022_1841-150351-0029 BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
441-128982-0023_26-495-0071 WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
441-128982-0024_1898-145724-0037 ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
441-128982-0027_887-123289-0017 AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
441-128982-0029_5339-14133-0045 NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
441-128982-0033_1116-137572-0055 HE CUT DOWN A NUMBER OF SMALL TREES AND WHEN HE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE SLENDER TRUNKS HE BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH REEDS AND OSIERS WHICH HE FOUND ON THE RIVER BANK SO AFTER INFINITE LABOR AND TRIAL HE CONSTRUCTED A RAFT WHICH WOULD BEAR HIM ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
441-128982-0034_289-121652-0010 GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
441-128988-0000_3242-67168-0023 CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0001_1246-124548-0038 THAT HE HAD COME BACK A COMPARATIVE PAUPER SURPRISED NO ONE FOR THIS WAS A COMMON THING TO HAPPEN TO A PIRATE BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE GOT BACK AT ALL HE HAD NO MONEY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS CRAFTY ABILITIES
441-128988-0002_5192-19397-0063 HE MANAGED TO GET POSSESSION OF A SHIP WHICH HE MANNED WITH A CREW OF ABOUT A SCORE OF IMPECUNIOUS DARE DEVILS WHO WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING TO MEND THEIR FORTUNES HAVING NOW BECOME VERY FOND OF LAND FIGHTING
441-128988-0004_5750-35690-0025 SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
441-128988-0005_6019-3185-0090 HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
441-128988-0006_4397-15678-0027 HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
441-128988-0007_4853-27670-0036 INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
441-128988-0012_4640-19188-0021 WITH CANNON AND A WELL ARMED CREW WOULD HAVE ALTERED HIS PLANS SO COMPLETELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COAST OF CUBA WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION BUT THE PIRATES OF THAT DAY SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE ELEMENT OF ODDS
441-128988-0014_2416-152139-0056 BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
441-128988-0017_7148-59157-0002 FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
441-128988-0022_302-123523-0003 BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
441-128988-0023_1970-10594-0031 HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
441-128988-0026_3879-173592-0033 CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
441-128988-0027_7113-86041-0035 WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
441-128988-0028_2289-152253-0030 AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
441-128988-0029_7067-76048-0039 WHEN THIS MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED BY THE DIGNIFIED OFFICIAL WHO FILLED THE POST OF GOVERNOR OF CUBA HE STORMED AND FAIRLY FOAMED AT THE MOUTH TO BE UTTERLY FOILED AND DISCOMFITED BY THIS RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0030_7447-91186-0000 AND TO BE AFTERWARDS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNHEARD OF INSOLENCE AND ABUSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY OF HIS OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS HE SWORE A TERRIBLE OATH THAT AFTER THAT HOUR HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GIVE QUARTER TO ANY BUCCANEER
441-128988-0031_4788-91208-0004 BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
441-128988-0032_4680-16026-0000 AND THEY FEARED THAT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT NO BUCCANEER WAS TO RECEIVE QUARTER THE SPANISH COLONISTS WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHERE THEY MIGHT BE FOUND AND TAKEN
441-128988-0034_5778-12761-0011 AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
441-130108-0000_87-121553-0100 A SPUTTERING OF MUSKETRY WAS ALWAYS TO BE HEARD LATER THE CANNON HAD ENTERED THE DISPUTE IN THE FOG FILLED AIR THEIR VOICES MADE A THUDDING SOUND THE REVERBERATIONS WERE CONTINUAL
441-130108-0002_3374-298032-0022 HE COULD SEE THE LOW LINE OF TRENCHES BUT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE A FEW IDLE FLAGS WERE PERCHED ON THE DIRT HILLS
441-130108-0004_8770-295465-0028 IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
441-130108-0005_4441-76262-0036 ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
441-130108-0009_5778-54535-0006 THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
441-130108-0010_3699-175950-0009 OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED

441-130108-0019_3374-298025-0018 THE SPEECH PIERCED THE YOUTH INWARDLY HE WAS REDUCED TO AN ABJECT PULP BY THESE CHANCE WORDS HIS LEGS QUAKED PRIVATELY HE CAST A FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT THE SARCASTIC MAN WHY NO HE HASTENED TO SAY IN A CONCILIATING VOICE
441-130108-0020_2518-154825-0031 I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
441-130108-0021_5463-39174-0042 THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
441-130108-0026_4898-28461-0067 INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE

446-123501-0003_4406-16882-0037 THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
446-123501-0006_1926-143879-0000 FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
446-123501-0007_3112-9555-0085 NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
446-123501-0009_2002-139469-0073 MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
446-123501-0010_412-126975-0090 MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
446-123501-0013_3214-167606-0021 AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
446-123501-0016_696-92939-0011 WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
446-123501-0017_118-47824-0032 THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
446-123501-0018_125-121124-0047 THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
446-123501-0019_3830-12530-0041 THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
446-123501-0021_4397-15668-0024 ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
446-123501-0026_3259-158083-0091 HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0027_2436-2477-0016 HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0030_3440-171006-0005 ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
446-123501-0031_8468-286673-0022 WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
446-123501-0032_211-122442-0024 AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THE ONLY MAMMAL EXISTING ON MARS ALONE HAVE WELL FORMED NAILS AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO HOOFED ANIMALS IN EXISTENCE THERE BEHIND THIS FIRST CHARGING DEMON
446-123501-0033_4441-76263-0001 TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
446-123501-0034_1502-122619-0067 AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
446-123501-0036_3168-173565-0033 OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
446-123501-0038_1594-135914-0011 FROM MY PURSUERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE I ALIGHTED UPON THE SOFT MOSS EASILY AND WITHOUT MISHAP AND TURNING SAW MY ENEMIES LINED UP ALONG THE FURTHER WALL
446-123501-0039_6078-54013-0004 SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
446-123501-0042_19-198-0013 AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
446-123501-0044_5688-41232-0067 WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
446-123501-0045_5688-41232-0036 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0046_7780-274562-0002 WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
446-123501-0050_1263-141777-0006 AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
446-123501-0052_1455-134435-0010 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0054_458-126305-0037 SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
446-123501-0055_5192-19397-0059 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123501-0056_26-495-0034 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
446-123501-0060_6385-34655-0016 THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
446-123502-0004_6415-100596-0013 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
446-123502-0006_8014-112586-0020 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0007_3240-131231-0057 THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
446-123502-0008_8063-274112-0032 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009_5750-35690-0024 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0010_289-121652-0028 IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
446-123502-0012_7859-102519-0008 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0014_150-132655-0016 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0016_8098-275181-0002 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0018_5192-19396-0029 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0020_250-142276-0017 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0022_4297-13009-0046 NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
446-123502-0023_6064-56168-0002 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0029_7635-105409-0033 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0034_7078-271888-0091 AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
446-123502-0040_4088-158077-0022 WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
446-123502-0041_226-122538-0023 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0044_8238-274553-0032 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045_196-122150-0010 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0046_4137-11701-0015 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
446-123502-0048_5393-19219-0022 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
446-123502-0049_2893-139322-0012 LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
4481-17498-0000_4813-248641-0026 THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
4481-17498-0001_7517-100442-0002 THE CHARACTERS BEING TAKEN TO ENTIRELY NEW SCENES THE VARIOUS FOREIGN LOCALITIES ARE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED
4481-17498-0002_4051-11218-0010 WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE MAY ACQUIRE A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEM
4481-17498-0005_3857-182317-0012 MANY WHO HAVE TRAVELLED SOMEWHAT OUTSIDE THE BEATEN TRACKS IN SICILY WILL FRANKLY VOUCH FOR THIS STATEMENT ITALY IS DOING ITS BEST TO SUPPRESS THE MAFIA AND TO ELIMINATE BRIGANDAGE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ISLANDS IT CONTROLS BUT SO FEW OF THE INHABITANTS ARE ITALIANS
4481-17498-0008_2989-138028-0039 THE DOYLES ARE ASTONISHED IT WAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN MISS PATRICIA DOYLE'S PRETTY FLAT AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE IN THE SMALL DRAWING ROOM PATRICIA OR PATSY AS SHE PREFERRED TO BE CALLED
4481-17498-0010_1624-142933-0004 A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A GRAY SUIT WHOSE FEATURES WERE TEMPORARILY ECLIPSED BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT WAS SPREAD CAREFULLY OVER THEM OCCASIONALLY A GASP OR A SNORE FROM BENEATH THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS SNOOZING
4481-17498-0016_2817-142371-0049 SHE SWUNG AROUND ON THE STOOL AND LOOKED WITH AMUSEMENT AT HER NEWLY AWAKENED UNCLE YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SHE SAID NO INDEED QUITE A MISTAKE REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN SERIOUSLY I'VE ONLY BEEN THINKING
4481-17498-0019_6367-74004-0012 THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED WAS THAT YOU SNORED LIKE A MAN THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MANNERS AN GONE TO SLEEP IN THE PRISENCE OF A LADY THEN NO ONE HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAT DECLARED PATSY SOOTHINGLY AND I'M SURE OUR DEAR UNCLE JOHN'S THOUGHTS
4481-17498-0021_83-9960-0018 I'M GOING TO EUROPE HE SAID THE MAJOR GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START AND THEN TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM CURIOUSLY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE PATSY ALONG HE CONTINUED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN THE MAJOR FROWNED
4481-17498-0023_8630-305213-0026 AS THE FULL MEANING OF UNCLE JOHN'S ABRUPT AVOWAL BECAME APPARENT THE MAJOR WAS STILL FROWNING BUT A HALF FRIGHTENED EXPRESSION HAD REPLACED THE ONE OF SCORNFUL RAILLERY FOR HE TOO KNEW THAT HIS ECCENTRIC BROTHER IN LAW WAS LIKELY TO PROPOSE ANY PREPOSTEROUS THING
4481-17498-0024_1578-140049-0024 AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
4481-17498-0026_1116-137572-0010 I WILL ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN TO US SIR THE BRUTAL SUGGESTION YOU HAVE JUST ADVANCED UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED IN THE DAYS WHEN MAJOR DOYLE HAD THOUGHT HIM A POOR MAN AND IN NEED OF A HELPING HAND
4481-17498-0029_7447-91186-0029 HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LITTLE MAN INCREASED MIGHTILY BUT HIS RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE PROMPTLY CHANGED AND A CHANCE TO REPROVE OR DISCOMFIT HIS ABSURDLY RICH BROTHER IN LAW WAS ONE OF HIS MOST SATISFACTORY DIVERSIONS UNCLE JOHN APPRECIATED THIS
4481-17498-0030_1502-122619-0049 AND HOLDING THE DIGNIFIED MAJOR IN LOVING REGARD WAS GLAD TO CROSS SWORDS WITH HIM NOW AND THEN TO ADD VARIETY TO THEIR PLEASANT RELATIONS IT'S THIS WAY MAJOR DOYLE HE NOW REMARKED COOLLY
4481-17498-0032_481-123720-0027 THAT'S IT SAID UNCLE JOHN YOU'VE MADE ME A QUARTER OF A MILLION THAT I DON'T WANT THE C H AND D STOCKS WERE GOING TO PIECES WHEN I BOUGHT THEM AND I HAD REASON TO HOPE I'D LOSE A GOOD ROUND SUM ON THEM BUT THE CONFOUNDED LUCK TURNED
4481-17498-0033_3879-174923-0063 AND THE RESULT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF ALL THIS DREADFUL MONEY SO MY DEAR MAJOR
4481-17498-0034_2764-36617-0009 AND WHERE BY INDUSTRY AND PERSEVERANCE I CAN SCATTER SOME OF MY ILL GOTTEN GAINS THE MAJOR SMILED GRIMLY THAT'S EUROPE RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID AND I DON'T OBJECT JOHN TO YOUR GOING THERE WHENEVER YOU PLEASE YOU'RE DISGRACEFULLY COUNTRYFIED
4481-17498-0037_5339-14133-0041 THE MAJOR'S SPEECH HAD A TOUCH OF THE BROGUE WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED BUT RECOVERED WHEN HE CALMED DOWN WHY YOU SELFISH OLD HUMBUG CRIED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WHY CAN'T SHE GO WHEN THERE'S MONEY AND TIME TO SPARE
4481-17498-0042_2436-2476-0021 AND MISTER MARVIN HAS BEEN SO KIND AND CONSIDERATE THAT I WON'T PLAY HIM A DIRTY TRICK BY LEAVING HIM IN THE LURCH PATSY NODDED APPROVAL THAT'S RIGHT DADDY SHE SAID UNCLE JOHN LAY BACK IN THE CHAIR AND PUT THE NEWSPAPER OVER HIS FACE AGAIN
4481-17498-0043_39-121914-0047 THEN THE MAJOR DREW OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND MOPPED HIS BROW YOU'D LIKE TO GO MAVOURNEEN HE ASKED SOFTLY YES DADDY BUT I WON'T OF COURSE TUT TUT DON'T YOU GO PUTTING YOURSELF AGAINST YOUR OLD FATHER'S WILL PATSY IT'S NOT SO FAR TO EUROPE HE CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY
4481-17498-0045_2764-36619-0039 SHE WAS IN HIS LAP NOW HER CHUBBY ARMS CLASPED AROUND HIS NECK AND HER SOFT CHEEK LAID CLOSE BESIDE HIS ROUGH AND RUDDY ONE AND WHEN YE GET BACK PATSY DARLIN HE WHISPERED TENDERLY STROKING HER HAIR
4481-17498-0046_7264-92316-0019 IT'S THE WAY OF LIFE MAVOURNEEN UNLESS A COUPLE HAPPENS TO BE SIAMESE TWINS THEY'RE BOUND TO GET SEPARATED IN THE COURSE OF EVENTS MORE OR LESS IF NOT FREQUENTLY I WON'T GO DADDY
4481-17499-0001_1992-141719-0019 AND IN ALL MY HARD WORKING LIFE NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS TRAVELLING OR ENJOYING MYSELF UNTIL I FELL IN WITH YOU AND YOU TAUGHT ME HOW PLEASANT IT IS TO SCATTER SUNSHINE IN THE HEARTS OF OTHERS FOR TO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY MEANS A LOT OF JOY FOR YOURSELF
4481-17499-0002_3723-171631-0059 A SECRET YOU WERE TRYING TO KEEP FROM ME YOU CRAFTY YOUNG WOMAN UNTIL I DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT NOW HERE I AM WITH THREE NIECES ON MY HANDS YOU MAY SAY TWO SIR INTERRUPTED THE MAJOR PATSY CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
4481-17499-0003_5867-48852-0089 HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID UNCLE JOHN I SAY I'VE GOT THREE NIECES AS FINE A TRIO OF INTELLIGENT SWEET AND ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN AS YOU'LL RUN ACROSS IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS I DARE YOU TO DENY IT SIR

4481-17499-0008_3440-171009-0056 PERHAPS SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE SUGGESTED THE MAJOR WELL I'LL SEE HER AND HER MOTHER TO MORROW MORNING DECIDED UNCLE JOHN
4481-17499-0015_8419-293469-0013 BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
4481-17499-0016_441-128988-0013 ELIZABETH DE GRAF BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A MUSIC TEACHER IN CLOVERTON OHIO WHILE LOUISE MERRICK LIVED WITH HER WIDOWED MOTHER IN A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SECOND CLASS IN NEW YORK
4481-17499-0017_5192-19397-0053 WHERE THE TWO WOMEN FRANKLY INTRIGUED TO ENSNARE FOR LOUISE A HUSBAND WHO HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS TO ENSURE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER A COMFORTABLE HOME IN SPITE OF THIS WORLDLY AND UNLOVELY AMBITION WHICH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PARTIALLY EXCUSE LOUISE
4481-17499-0020_2893-139322-0030 AND INSTALLED HER AND THE MAJOR IN ITS COSIEST APARTMENT THE RENTS OF THE REMAINING FLATS GIVING THE DOYLES AN ADEQUATE INCOME FOR ALL TIME TO COME HERE UNCLE JOHN BELIEVING HIMSELF CORDIALLY WELCOME AS INDEED HE WAS MADE HIS OWN HOME
4481-17499-0022_1069-133699-0044 HAD LONG MANAGED SUCCESSFULLY JOHN MERRICK'S VAST FORTUNE AND AT HIS SOLICITATION IT GAVE MAJOR DOYLE A RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN ITS MAIN OFFICE WITH A SALARY THAT RENDERED HIM INDEPENDENT OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDENLY ACQUIRED WEALTH AND MADE HIM PROUD AND SELF RESPECTING
4481-17499-0023_6818-68772-0020 MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
4481-17499-0027_2002-139469-0055 BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
4481-17499-0029_322-124147-0063 SIPPING HER COFFEE IN AN UPPER ROOM BUT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO UNCLE JOHN HER DEAD HUSBAND'S BROTHER AND HER ONLY DAUGHTER'S BENEFACTOR WHICH MEANT INDIRECTLY HER OWN BENEFACTOR SO SHE ORDERED THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
4481-17499-0031_6272-70171-0040 AND THE DEAR CHILD WAS AT THE OPERA LAST NIGHT WHICH MADE HER LATE IN GETTING HOME DOESN'T THE OPERA LET OUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE SAME AS THE THEATRES HE ASKED I BELIEVE SO BUT THERE IS THE SUPPER AFTERWARD YOU KNOW

458-126305-0039_6081-41998-0014 I SANK DEEP DEEP DOWN UNTIL AT LAST I GOT TO THE BOTTOM
458-126305-0040_8095-274346-0041 OUT OF THE BARREL AND CREPT OUT AND THERE WERE PRETTY MEADOWS ON WHICH A NUMBER OF LAMBS WERE FEEDING AND FROM THENCE I BROUGHT THIS FLOCK AWAY WITH ME SAID THE PEASANTS ARE THERE ANY MORE THERE

460-172357-0000_1447-130550-0005 I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
460-172357-0001_289-121652-0020 MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
460-172357-0002_6818-68772-0032 AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
460-172357-0004_6367-65536-0069 AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
460-172357-0007_89-219-0041 AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
460-172357-0009_4830-25898-0039 I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
460-172357-0011_909-131044-0032 AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
460-172357-0013_4481-17498-0035 NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
460-172357-0015_4018-103416-0028 COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
460-172357-0021_307-127540-0027 MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
460-172357-0023_200-124140-0030 ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
460-172357-0024_1263-141777-0011 A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
460-172359-0003_4640-19189-0034 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0005_5192-19397-0010 EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
460-172359-0009_2817-142371-0023 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0012_481-123720-0007 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013_5867-48852-0068 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0019_3259-158083-0065 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0020_1553-140047-0009 WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
460-172359-0024_248-130697-0020 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0027_3699-175950-0001 IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
460-172359-0028_8312-279790-0037 I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
460-172359-0030_1502-122619-0039 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
460-172359-0031_8098-275181-0029 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0034_6019-3185-0110 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
460-172359-0035_3112-9554-0008 CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
460-172359-0036_250-140277-0001 THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
460-172359-0039_7367-86737-0040 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040_8095-274346-0007 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0041_6415-111615-0012 AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
460-172359-0042_3112-9555-0074 BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
460-172359-0043_1116-137572-0050 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0047_78-368-0037 THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
460-172359-0048_8975-270782-0009 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0049_298-126791-0034 IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
460-172359-0050_1235-135884-0030 I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
460-172359-0051_8324-286682-0047 AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
460-172359-0052_831-130746-0022 A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
460-172359-0053_233-155990-0038 AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
460-172359-0054_3526-176651-0022 AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
460-172359-0055_198-129977-0006 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0060_445-123857-0000 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0062_1594-135914-0125 THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
460-172359-0063_40-222-0066 HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
460-172359-0065_2952-410-0055 SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
460-172359-0068_6563-63821-0001 FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
460-172359-0071_1263-141777-0003 THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
460-172359-0072_3214-167607-0033 I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
460-172359-0074_5750-100289-0062 ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
460-172359-0075_3214-167606-0012 AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
460-172359-0076_201-127786-0016 AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
460-172359-0077_7078-271888-0095 LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
460-172359-0082_6147-34606-0031 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0083_7859-102518-0011 AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI

460-172359-0096_2911-15045-0005 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0098_2416-152137-0036 JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
460-172359-0099_6385-220959-0018 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD

4640-19187-0001_1578-140045-0009 AND AN EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE TWO COLOSSAL BARRICADES WHICH WE HAVE JUST SKETCHED BUT IT WAS FORMIDABLE FOR THAT EPOCH
4640-19187-0003_8797-294123-0100 THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED
4640-19187-0006_587-54108-0005 ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
4640-19187-0008_5750-35690-0020 AND MABEUF LYING PRONE THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
4640-19187-0015_3440-171009-0031 THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET

4640-19187-0021_4088-158079-0008 THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES

4640-19189-0002_8609-283227-0021 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0003_2002-139469-0113 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS

4680-16041-0016_8609-283227-0004 ENTERING A STREET WAS LIKE ENTERING A CELLAR HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HE TOOK A FEW STEPS SOME ONE PASSED CLOSE TO HIM AT A RUN WAS IT A MAN OR A WOMAN WERE THERE MANY OF THEM HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
4680-16041-0017_1578-140049-0033 IT HAD PASSED AND VANISHED PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET
4680-16041-0019_839-130898-0064 HE CLIMBED OVER THE STONES AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER HE WALKED VERY NEAR THE STREET POSTS AND GUIDED HIMSELF ALONG THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE IT SEEMED TO HIM
4680-16041-0020_7067-76047-0033 MARIUS LEFT THE HORSES BEHIND HIM AS HE WAS APPROACHING A STREET WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THE RUE DU CONTRAT SOCIAL A SHOT COMING NO ONE KNOWS WHENCE AND TRAVERSING THE DARKNESS AT RANDOM WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIM
4680-16041-0023_198-126831-0038 HOLLOWED OUT IN THE CENTRE OF PARIS THERE THE GLANCE FELL INTO AN ABYSS THANKS TO THE BROKEN LANTERNS THANKS TO THE CLOSED WINDOWS THERE ALL RADIANCE ALL LIFE ALL SOUND ALL MOVEMENT CEASED
4680-16041-0024_4160-11549-0026 THE INVISIBLE POLICE OF THE INSURRECTION WERE ON THE WATCH EVERYWHERE AND MAINTAINED ORDER THAT IS TO SAY NIGHT THE NECESSARY TACTICS OF INSURRECTION ARE TO DROWN SMALL NUMBERS IN A VAST OBSCURITY
4680-16041-0027_8419-286667-0012 AND THE VAGUE REFLECTIONS WHICH ARE CAST BACK BY THE WET AND MUDDY PAVEMENTS WERE VISIBLE AN EYE CAST UPWARD AT THAT MASS OF SHADOWS MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE AT INTERVALS
4680-16041-0030_8838-298545-0006 AND WHERE A FEW STREET LANTERNS STILL BURNED THE AERIAL OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE DISTINGUISHED THE METALLIC GLEAM OF SWORDS AND BAYONETS THE DULL RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY AND THE SWARMING OF SILENT BATTALIONS WHOSE RANKS WERE SWELLING FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE
4680-16041-0031_5192-19397-0031 AND AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT DARKNESS A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE
4680-16041-0036_587-41611-0028 THAT TRIUMPH SHOULD REST EITHER HERE OR THERE THAT THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PROVE ITSELF A REVOLUTION OR A SKIRMISH THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THIS AS WELL AS THE PARTIES THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT BOURGEOIS FELT IT
4680-16041-0037_211-122425-0038 HERE ONLY ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE A SOUND AS HEART RENDING AS THE DEATH RATTLE
4680-16041-0039_8770-295465-0035 WHICH HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SO MANY REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS WHILE YOUTH THE SECRET ASSOCIATIONS THE SCHOOLS IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN THE NAME OF INTERESTS
4680-16042-0000_460-172359-0064 IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHT
4680-16042-0001_3830-12531-0005 HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
4680-16042-0003_458-126305-0024 ALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS DISTANT FROM HIM IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIM
4680-16042-0005_1970-10594-0024 FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
4680-16042-0007_39-121915-0025 AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HER
4680-16042-0010_2391-145015-0105 AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
4680-16042-0012_3112-9555-0021 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETS
4680-16042-0015_1235-135883-0038 HAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIM
4680-16042-0016_911-128684-0066 SHOULD HE RETREAT AFTER GOING SO FAR SHOULD HE FLEE FROM DANGER AFTER HAVING APPROACHED IT SHOULD HE SLIP AWAY AFTER HAVING COME AND PEEPED INTO THE BARRICADE SLIP AWAY ALL IN A TREMBLE SAYING AFTER ALL I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AS IT IS
4680-16042-0017_1116-132847-0036 WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
4680-16042-0018_6818-76332-0035 ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED IT A SORT OF SPLENDID RECTIFICATION HAD JUST BEEN EFFECTED IN HIS MIND THERE IS A WIDENING OF THE SPHERE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS PECULIAR TO THE VICINITY OF THE GRAVE
4680-16042-0019_426-122819-0029 IT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO BE NEAR DEATH THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERB
4680-16042-0020_2289-152254-0007 HE LEFT NONE OF THEM UNANSWERED LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTY
4680-16042-0023_7264-92314-0018 WHETHER FOREIGN OR CIVIL IS INIQUITOUS IT IS CALLED CRIME OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THAT HOLY THING JUSTICE BY WHAT RIGHT DOES ONE FORM OF MAN DESPISE ANOTHER BY WHAT RIGHT SHOULD THE SWORD OF WASHINGTON
4680-16042-0024_4088-158077-0050 THE ONE IS THE DEFENDER THE OTHER THE LIBERATOR SHALL WE BRAND EVERY APPEAL TO ARMS WITHIN A CITY'S LIMITS WITHOUT TAKING THE OBJECT INTO A CONSIDERATION THEN NOTE THE INFAMY OF BRUTUS MARCEL ARNOULD VON BLANKENHEIM COLIGNY HEDGEROW WAR
4680-16042-0026_1963-147036-0004 AN INVASION VIOLATES THE GEOGRAPHICAL FRONTIER DRIVING OUT THE TYRANT OR DRIVING OUT THE ENGLISH IN BOTH CASES REGAINING POSSESSION OF ONE'S OWN TERRITORY THERE COMES AN HOUR WHEN PROTESTATION NO LONGER SUFFICES
4680-16042-0027_4898-20016-0015 THE TENTH OF AUGUST ELECTRIFIES THEM
4680-16042-0029_6836-61803-0036 TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
4680-16042-0031_2416-152137-0000 ARE WHAT HISTORY IS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING GOOD KINGS BUT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT TO BE PARCELLED OUT THE LOGIC OF THE TRUE IS RECTILINEAR THE PECULIARITY OF TRUTH IS THAT IT LACKS COMPLAISANCE NO CONCESSIONS THEN
4680-16042-0032_8629-261139-0075 BOTH REPRESENT IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE CONFISCATION OF RIGHT AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR AWAY UNIVERSAL INSURRECTION THEY MUST BE COMBATED IT MUST BE DONE FRANCE BEING ALWAYS THE ONE TO BEGIN
4680-16042-0036_3486-166424-0059 THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS NOT NOTICED IT IN HIS OWN CASE THE SOUL AND THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF ITS UNITY COMPLICATED WITH UBIQUITY HAS A STRANGE APTITUDE FOR REASONING ALMOST COLDLY IN THE MOST VIOLENT EXTREMITIES
4680-16042-0037_1898-145720-0000 WITHOUT MOVING AND THERE WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT QUASI SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE LAST STAGE OF EXPECTATION OVERHEAD AT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE THIRD STORY MARIUS DESCRIED A SORT OF SPECTATOR WHO APPEARED TO HIM TO BE SINGULARLY ATTENTIVE
4680-16042-0039_1898-145702-0006 ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE MAN WHO WAS DEAD WAS SURVEYING THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO DIE A LONG TRAIL OF BLOOD WHICH HAD FLOWED FROM THAT HEAD DESCENDED IN REDDISH THREADS FROM THE WINDOW TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRST FLOOR
4788-294466-0000_887-123291-0022 MARY'S NETTLESOME BROWN PONY WAS HARD TO QUIET UNTIL JERRY REACHED OUT A STRONG BROWN HAND AND PATTED ITS HEAD MARY LIFTED STARTLED BLUE EYES JERRY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SHE ASKED
4788-294466-0002_8051-295385-0026 HE MUST HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS IF HE WAS OLD WHEN JERRY'S FATHER WAS A BOY OF COURSE DORA LESS INCLINED TO BE IMAGINATIVE REPLIED THEN TO THE COWBOY SHE SAID IN HER PRACTICAL MATTER OF FACT WAY
4788-294466-0004_8095-274345-0015 SHE SMILED AT HER FRIEND MARY NOT WISHING TO APPEAR FOOLISHLY TIMID SAID IN AS COURAGEOUS A VOICE AS SHE COULD MUSTER OF COURSE WE'RE NOT AFRAID GOODBYE BOYS WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
4788-294466-0007_4195-17507-0019 OH MARY HOW BLIND YOU ARE DREAMILY THE YOUNGER GIRL WAS SAYING THAT'S BECAUSE WE WERE PLAYMATES WHEN WE WERE LITTLE SO VERY LONG AGO OH MY HOW ANCIENT WE ARE DORA SAID TEASINGLY
4788-294466-0010_4014-186175-0014 AND JERRY'S MOTHER TAUGHT A LITTLE DESERT SCHOOL OVER NEAR THE NEWCOMB RANCH SHE DIDN'T TEACH LONG THOUGH FOR THAT VERY FIRST VACATION SHE MARRIED JERRY'S COWBOY FATHER AFTER THAT MOTHER AND MISSUS NEWCOMB WERE GOOD FRIENDS NATURALLY BEING BRIDES AND NEIGHBORS
4788-294466-0013_1235-135883-0009 IT WAS VERY STILL NOT A SOUND WAS TO BE HEARD NOW AND THEN A RABBIT DARTED PAST SILENTLY HOW PEACEFUL THIS HOUR IS ON THE DESERT MARY BEGAN GLANCING AT HER FRIEND WHO WAS RIDING SO CLOSE AT HER SIDE
4788-294466-0014_6078-54013-0072 NOTICING THAT DORA WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT SHE ASKED LIGHTLY WON'T YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD WHY OF COURSE I WAS JUST WONDERING WHY JERRY HURRIED US AWAY SO FAST FROM LUCKY LOON'S ROCK HOUSE BECAUSE HE HAD TO DO THE MILKING MARY REPLIED SIMPLY
4788-294466-0017_2436-2481-0010 I'M CRAZY ABOUT MYSTERIES AS YOU KNOW AND IF THERE REALLY IS ONE ABOUT THAT ROCK HOUSE I WANT TO TRY TO SOLVE IT SHE SAID NO MORE ABOUT IT JUST THEN AS THEY HAD REACHED THE OLD GHOST TOWN OF GLEESON
4788-294466-0019_3664-11714-0003 GRAY BEARDED UNKEMPT BUT WITH KIND GRAY EYES DEEP SUNKEN UNDER SHAGGY BROWS STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR HE SMILED OUT AT THEM IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN BECKONED WITH A BONY FINGER
4788-294466-0021_8425-292520-0005 DORA EXCLAIMED AS SHE RODE CLOSE TO THE PORCH THANKS A LOT SHE CALLED BRIGHTLY UP TO THE OLD MAN WHO WAS HANDING THE PACKET DOWN OVER THE SAGGING WOODEN RAIL HIS FRIENDLY TOOTHLESS SMILE WAS DIRECTED AT THE SMALLER GIRL
4788-294466-0022_39-121915-0006 HE SAID MIS FARLEY YER NURSE WOMAN CAME DOWN TER MAIL SOME LETTERS A SPELL BACK THEN BEFORE MARY COULD REPLY HE CONTINUED IN HIS SHRILL WAVERING VOICE
4788-294466-0023_887-123289-0013 PALE FELLAR WI SPECS ON IS HER SON AIN'T HE YES MISTER HARVEY DICK IS MISSUS FARLEY'S SON MARY TOOK TIME IN A FRIENDLY WAY TO SATISFY THE OLD MAN'S CURIOSITY
4788-294466-0026_1246-124550-0019 YOU WAIT UNTIL DICK HAS BEEN ON THE DESERT LONG ENOUGH TO GET A COAT OF TAN HE MAY SURPRISE YOU
4788-294466-0028_8312-279790-0045 A BRIGHT BLACK EYED MEXICAN BOY OF ABOUT TEN RAN OUT TO THE ROAD AS THE GIRLS APPROACHED COME ON EMANUEL MARY SANG DOWN TO HIM YOU MAY PUT UP OUR HORSES AND EARN A DIME THE SMALL BOY'S WHITE TEETH FLASHED IN A DELIGHTED GRIN
4788-294466-0030_6272-70171-0000 ITS BROAD PORCH AND ADOBE PILLARS HERE HER MOTHER HAD COME AS A BRIDE HERE MARY HAD BEEN BORN EIGHT HAPPY YEARS THEY HAD SPENT TOGETHER BEFORE HER MOTHER DIED AFTER MARY HAD BEEN TAKEN EAST TO SCHOOL HER FATHER HAD RETURNED
4788-294466-0031_78-368-0051 THEN GLANCING UP AT THE NURSE WHO HAD APPEARED FROM HER FATHER'S BEDROOM SHE ASKED EAGERLY MAY I TELL DAD AN ADVENTURE WE'VE HAD MISSUS FARLEY MIDDLE AGED KIND FACED SHOOK HER HEAD SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL NOT TONIGHT PLEASE WON'T TOMORROW DO
4788-91208-0002_669-129061-0009 THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL POINTSMAN OF OUR AGE THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GENERATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE THOUGHT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT TO MEASURE THE LOSS TO HUMANITY BY THE RESULT OF HIS LABORS
4788-91208-0005_3374-298026-0011 THAT HE BORROWED FROM WHEWELL MUCH OF HIS CLASSIFICATION FROM BROWN THE CHIEF LINES OF HIS THEORY OF CAUSATION FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE INDUCTIVE METHODS THOSE WHO THINK THIS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS WORK MUST HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION
4788-91208-0006_5561-39621-0029 OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
4788-91208-0009_78-368-0038 SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
4788-91208-0012_887-123291-0042 AS THE ONLY BASES OF REASONING IT IS TRUE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE LOGIC OF THE SCHOOLS GREAT ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE RULES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THESE RULES WERE NOT ONLY IMPERFECT IN THEMSELVES BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF CAUSATION
4788-91208-0013_446-123501-0057 WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
4788-91208-0015_1447-130551-0026 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0017_4830-25898-0001 THE WORK OF DEDUCTION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE FORMULAS AND THEREFORE STRICTLY SPEAKING IS NOT INFERENTIAL AT ALL THE REAL INFERENCE WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITION WAS ARRIVED AT
4788-91208-0018_40-121026-0027 ALL REASONING IS SHOWN TO BE AT BOTTOM INDUCTIVE INDUCTIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF LOGIC AND TO INDUCTION ACCORDINGLY MISTER MILL DEVOTED HIS CHIEF ATTENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INDUCTION WAS TREATED AS THE OPUS MAGNUM OF LOGIC
4788-91208-0019_730-360-0025 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE TRACED TO THEIR INDUCTIVE ORIGIN IT WAS THIS TAKEN WITH HIS THEORY OF THE SYLLOGISM WHICH WORKED THE GREAT CHANGE BOTH HIS SYSTEM OF LOGIC AND HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY
4788-91208-0020_887-123289-0024 ARE FOR THE MOST PART DEVOTED TO FORTIFYING THIS POSITION AND DEMOLISHING BELIEFS INCONSISTENT WITH IT AS A SYSTEMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST MISTER MILL HAS NOT DONE SO MUCH AS EITHER PROFESSOR BAIN OR MISTER HERBERT SPENCER
4788-91208-0025_625-132112-0022 IN HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL GIVES BATTLE TO THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AFTER REVIEWING IN AN OPENING CHAPTER THE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD RESPECTING THE RELATIVITY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
4788-91208-0026_211-122425-0055 AS MISTER MILL SAYS THE NAME OF GOD IS VEILED UNDER TWO EXTREMELY ABSTRACT PHRASES INFINITE AND THE ABSOLUTE SO PROFOUND AND FRIENDLY A THINKER AS THE LATE MISTER GROTE HELD THIS RAISING OF THE VEIL INEXPEDIENT BUT HE PROVED
4788-91208-0030_3879-174923-0059 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031_1183-128659-0012 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0032_2182-150130-0033 AND WE JOIN WITH HIM IN CONTEMNING AS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL AND MEAN THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN NATURE AS INCAPABLE OF GIVING ITS LOVE AND DEVOTING ITS EXISTENCE TO ANY OBJECT WHICH CANNOT AFFORD IN EXCHANGE AN ETERNITY OF PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
4788-91208-0033_8465-246943-0027 NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
4788-91208-0034_311-124404-0064 AND ALL HIS RELATIONS TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE VERY BIRDS ABOUT HIS DWELLING SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT IT IS THIS NOBLE SENTIMENT WHICH INFUSES A SOUL OF LIFE INTO HIS TEACHINGS AND THE ENUNCIATION AND ACTING OUT OF WHICH CONSTITUTE HIM
4788-94904-0000_2289-152258-0015 WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
4788-94904-0001_1578-140049-0022 THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE GENERALLY SPEAKING LESS SUITABLE TO THEM THOUGH THIS IS NOT TRUE UNIVERSALLY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF A PEOPLE TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF HUMANITY
4788-94904-0002_669-129061-0064 AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
4788-94904-0003_4160-11549-0038 THAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO FULFILL THE DUTIES AND DISCHARGE THE FUNCTIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES ON THEM THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT ONLY BECOMES A PRACTICAL QUESTION WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED RULER OR A FOREIGN NATION OR NATIONS
4788-94904-0006_3235-28433-0049 THE CONTRARY CASE IS NOT INDEED UNEXAMPLED THERE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN A RELIGIOUS REPUGNANCE TO ANY LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF A PARTICULAR LINE OF RULERS BUT IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE MEANT ONLY SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF THE POWERS THAT BE
4788-94904-0007_6209-34601-0022 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0008_3830-12535-0006 RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
4788-94904-0010_200-126784-0018 AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
4788-94904-0011_8468-294887-0007 UNLESS THEREFORE THE AUTHORITIES WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE ARE BACKED BY AN EFFECTIVE OPINION AND FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THE EXECUTIVE HAS ALWAYS THE MEANS OF SETTING THEM ASIDE OR COMPELLING THEM TO SUBSERVIENCE
4788-94904-0016_5322-7679-0033 OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
4788-94904-0019_298-126790-0035 WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
4788-94904-0020_250-142276-0021 THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
4788-94904-0022_2196-170379-0031 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY AS IN SPANISH AMERICA KEEP THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF CHRONIC REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR A DESPOTISM NOT EVEN LEGAL BUT OF ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE ALTERNATELY EXERCISED BY A SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
4788-94904-0029_6476-57446-0051 BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
4788-94904-0030_5561-41616-0034 OR UNLESS THE MILITARY CHIEFS ALLY THEMSELVES WITH HIS INFLUENCE AND TURN IT INTO A PROP FOR THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT A PEOPLE ARE NO LESS UNFITTED FOR REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BY THE CONTRARY FAULT TO THAT LAST SPECIFIED BY EXTREME PASSIVENESS
4788-94904-0031_1743-142914-0030 AND READY SUBMISSION TO TYRANNY IF A PEOPLE THUS PROSTRATED BY CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES COULD OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WOULD INEVITABLY CHOOSE THEIR TYRANTS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE YOKE WOULD BE MADE HEAVIER ON THEM BY THE CONTRIVANCE WHICH
4788-94904-0032_6019-3185-0078 MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LIGHTEN IT ON THE CONTRARY MANY A PEOPLE HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM THIS CONDITION BY THE AID OF A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHOSE POSITION HAS MADE IT THE RIVAL AND HAS ENDED BY MAKING IT THE MASTER OF THE LOCAL DESPOTS
4788-94904-0033_163-122947-0018 EVEN WHEN THE KING WAS SCARCELY SO POWERFUL AS MANY OF HIS CHIEF FEUDATORIES THE GREAT ADVANTAGE WHICH HE DERIVED FROM BEING BUT ONE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY FRENCH HISTORIANS TO HIM THE EYES OF ALL THE LOCALLY OPPRESSED WERE TURNED
4788-94904-0035_1737-142396-0016 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
4788-94904-0036_89-219-0055 IT ABATED IN THE OPPRESSED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE HABIT OF SUBMITTING TO OPPRESSION THE KING'S INTEREST LAY IN ENCOURAGING ALL PARTIAL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE SERFS TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR MASTERS AND PLACE THEMSELVES IN IMMEDIATE SUBORDINATION TO HIMSELF
4788-94904-0037_6437-66173-0043 UNDER HIS PROTECTION NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES WERE FORMED WHICH KNEW NO ONE ABOVE THEM BUT THE KING
4788-94904-0038_311-124404-0012 AND THE MONARCH WAS LONG COMPELLED BY NECESSITIES OF POSITION TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY AS THE ALLY RATHER THAN THE MASTER OF THE CLASSES WHOM HE HAD AIDED IN AFFECTING THEIR LIBERATION IN THIS MANNER A CENTRAL POWER DESPOTIC IN PRINCIPLE
481-123719-0000_3664-178366-0018 IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
481-123719-0001_625-132112-0015 I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
481-123719-0003_7800-283492-0030 PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
481-123719-0008_1841-150351-0016 BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
481-123719-0009_4830-25904-0021 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0010_8465-246947-0008 THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
481-123719-0013_19-198-0003 AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
481-123719-0014_2384-152900-0087 EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
481-123719-0016_426-122819-0008 INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
481-123719-0017_8975-270782-0097 IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
481-123719-0018_2136-5143-0006 EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
481-123719-0019_27-123349-0017 I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
481-123719-0020_307-127539-0008 MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
481-123719-0021_6385-220959-0027 AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
481-123719-0025_6272-70171-0036 AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
481-123719-0027_4441-76262-0000 TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
481-123719-0029_3526-175658-0005 HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
481-123719-0030_8088-284756-0088 ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0034_40-121026-0041 LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
481-123719-0039_4018-107338-0030 BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
481-123719-0041_8014-112586-0014 BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
481-123720-0002_4397-15678-0000 BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
481-123720-0005_7278-104730-0030 JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
481-123720-0008_5390-24512-0015 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
481-123720-0009_250-142276-0015 I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0010_5688-15787-0021 THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
481-123720-0012_1963-142393-0014 I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
481-123720-0014_200-124139-0037 AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0018_3830-12530-0039 BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
481-123720-0019_6385-220959-0036 BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
481-123720-0020_211-122425-0026 ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
481-123720-0022_8098-275181-0025 A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
481-123720-0025_8014-112602-0001 GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
481-123720-0029_1737-142397-0024 SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
481-123720-0030_3723-171631-0021 TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
481-123720-0032_7190-90542-0068 I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
481-123720-0036_8747-293952-0058 BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
481-123720-0038_4788-294466-0027 WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
481-123720-0039_2391-145015-0114 WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
481-123720-0045_8609-262281-0024 HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
481-123720-0048_3857-182315-0013 I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
481-123720-0049_4195-186237-0015 NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
481-123720-0050_7367-86737-0089 I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0052_1963-142393-0024 I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
481-123720-0056_200-124140-0025 IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0059_3947-13262-0046 AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0062_1970-26100-0023 BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063_3723-171115-0036 WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0066_1578-140049-0010 THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0068_4088-158077-0043 BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0070_2416-152139-0003 AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
481-123720-0072_1737-148989-0035 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0074_229-130880-0021 I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0076_6209-34601-0032 WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
481-123720-0077_39-121916-0014 AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0081_911-128684-0070 WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0084_5750-100289-0077 OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
4813-248638-0000_6437-66172-0020 A TOWN OF ENTERPRISE AND CHARACTER EVER SINCE THE FIRST WATER POWER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST POWDER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST CHOCOLATE MILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND THUS THROUGH A WHOLE LINE OF FIRST THINGS THE FIRST VIOLONCELLO
4813-248638-0001_5192-19397-0015 FEW PEOPLE TO DAY THINK OF MILTON IN TERMS OF INDUSTRIAL REPUTE BUT RATHER AS A PLACE OF ESTATES TOO ARISTOCRATIC TO BE FASHIONABLE
4813-248638-0002_2910-131096-0007 AND OF CHARMING WALKS AND DRIVES AND VIEWS MANY OF THE OLD FAMILIES WHO HAVE GIVEN THE TOWN ITS PRESTIGE STILL LIVE IN THEIR ANCESTRAL MANORS AND MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED THERE IN RECENT YEARS
4813-248638-0003_5393-19218-0057 AS THE STRANGER PASSES THROUGH MILTON HE IS CAPTIVATED BY GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT HOMESTEADS SETTLING BEHIND THEIR WHITE COLONIAL FENCES TOPPED WITH WHITE COLONIAL URNS HALF HIDDEN BY THEIR ANTIQUE TREES WITH AN AIR OF COMFORTABLE EASE
4813-248638-0004_2384-152900-0048 OF BREEDING THAT NEITHER PARADES NOR CONCEALS ITS QUALITY YES THIS IS MILTON THIS IS MODERN MILTON BOSTON SOCIETY RECEIVES SOME OF ITS MOST PROMINENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THIS PATRICIAN SOURCE
4813-248638-0005_2416-152137-0002 BUT MODERN MILTON IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS AS OLD MILTON
4813-248638-0006_4195-186238-0022 THAT SWIMS FOREVER AGAINST THE SKY THAT MARCHES FOREVER AROUND THE HORIZON THE ROUNDED SUMMITS OF THE BLUE HILLS TO WHICH THE EYE IS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BEFORE ENTERING THE TOWN WHICH PRINCIPALLY CLAIMS THEM ARE THE WORN DOWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS
4813-248638-0008_458-126305-0030 AND ARE THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST FROM THEM THE MASSACHUSET TRIBE ABOUT THE BAY DERIVED ITS NAME SIGNIFYING NEAR THE GREAT HILLS WHICH NAME WAS CHANGED BY THE ENGLISH TO MASSACHUSETTS
4813-248638-0010_4481-17498-0028 SO VAST THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DWARFED BESIDE THEM AND YET SO CURIOUSLY AIRY THAT THEY SEEM TO PERPETUALLY RIPPLE AGAINST THE SKY THE GREAT BLUE HILL ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHICH BEARS AN OBSERVATORY ON ITS SUMMIT SWIMS ABOVE ONE'S HEAD
4813-248638-0011_60-121082-0066 IT SEEMS TO HAVE A SINGULAR WAY OF MOVING FROM POINT TO POINT AS ONE MOTORS AND ALTHOUGH ONE MAY BE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THIS MAY BE DUE MORE TO THE WINDING ROADS THAN TO THE ILLUSIVENESS OF THE HILL STILL THE BUOYANT EFFECT IS THE SAME
4813-248638-0015_5778-12761-0007 AND THE WIDE FLAT TWIST OF THE NEPONSET RIVER WINDING THROUGH IT FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A DECORATIVE PANEL
4813-248638-0016_2289-152253-0025 THIS IS THE VIEW THAT THE GOVERNOR SO ADMIRED AND TRADITION TELLS US
4813-248638-0019_3168-173565-0042 THAT VISITORS ON ENTERING FROM THE STREET MIGHT SEE THE GLEAM OF HIS GOLD KNEE BUCKLES AS HE STOOD ON THE DISTANT PORCH THE AVENUE HOWEVER WAS NEVER COMPLETED AS BELCHER WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF AND TRANSFERRED TO NEW JERSEY SHORTLY AFTER

4813-248638-0024_7367-86737-0013 THAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM MEN AND WOMEN NOBLY NURTURED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS HOW MUCH OF ITS SUCCESS MILTON ATTRIBUTES TO ITS LOCATION FOR ONE JOINS INDEED A DISTINGUISHED FELLOWSHIP WHEN ONE BUILDS UPON A HILL
4813-248638-0025_2836-5355-0050 OR ON SEVERAL HILLS AS ROMAN AS WELL AS BOSTONIAN HISTORY TESTIFIES CAN ONLY BE GUESSED BY ITS TRIBUTE IN THE FORM OF THE BLUE HILLS RESERVATION THIS STATE RECREATION PARK AND FOREST RESERVE

4813-248638-0043_3947-13262-0025 THE HILL ITSELF SEEN FROM A DISTANCE FLOATING LIGHTLY LIKE A VAST BLUE BALL AGAINST A VASTER SKY IS DREAMILY SUGGESTIVE IN A WAY WHICH THE ACTUAL VIEW SUPERB AS IT IS IS NOT
4813-248638-0047_7278-104730-0010 AND THOSE MILLS STAND UPON THE SITE OF THE FIRST GRIST MILL IN NEW ENGLAND TO BE RUN BY WATER POWER THIS WAS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND ONE LIKES TO PICTURE THE STURDY COLONISTS TRAILING INTO TOWN THEIR PACKS UPON THEIR BACKS
4813-248638-0048_5339-14134-0042 LIKE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN GAMES TO HAVE THEIR GRAIN GROUND ISRAEL STOUGHTON WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST MILL A NAME PERPETUATED

4813-248641-0002_8238-274553-0029 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH FEATURE OF THE STEADILY MOVING TRAVEL WOULD MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE ORIGINAL PURITAN SETTLERS OF THE TOWN THE FACT THAT EVEN THE COMMON MAN THE POOR MAN COULD OWN SUCH A VEHICLE OF SPEED AND EASE OR THE FACT THAT AMERICA
4813-248641-0004_5750-100289-0040 AND THE FINE LADY WHOSE SOLE EXERCISE OF HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS CONSISTS IN ALLOWING HER MAID TO DRESS HER YES NEW ENGLAND HAS CHANGED AMAZINGLY IN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THREE CENTURIES

4813-248641-0011_1594-135914-0061 BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES
4813-248641-0012_374-180298-0060 NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND

4830-25898-0024_6563-285357-0038 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS MISSUS CLUCK KEPT HER THREE REMAINING LITTLE ONES CLOSE TO HER SIDE WATCHING OVER THEM WITH MATERNAL CARE TILL THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED OF HER ANXIOUS CLUCKINGS PEEP AND PECK WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER
4830-25898-0025_2518-154825-0029 BEING VERY FOND OF ONE ANOTHER PEEP WAS A MOST INQUISITIVE CHICKEN POKING HER HEAD INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER AND NEVER SATISFIED TILL SHE HAD SEEN ALL THERE WAS TO SEE PECK WAS A GLUTTON

4830-25898-0040_198-126831-0049 HAD LOVED HER AS MUCH AS SHE DID THE OTHERS WHO WERE ALL WHITE GRAY OR YELLOW POOR LITTLE BLOT HAD BEEN MUCH NEGLECTED BY EVERY ONE BUT NOW HER LONELY MAMMA DISCOVERED HOW GOOD AND AFFECTIONATE A CHICKEN SHE WAS
4830-25898-0041_403-126855-0013 FOR BLOT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HER NEVER RUNNING AWAY OR DISOBEYING IN ANY WAY BUT ALWAYS CLOSE TO HER SIDE READY TO CREEP UNDER HER WING OR BRING HER A PLUMP BUG WHEN THE POOR BIDDY'S APPETITE FAILED HER
4830-25898-0042_4088-158077-0026 THEY WERE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER TILL THANKSGIVING DREW NEAR WHEN A DREADFUL PESTILENCE SEEMED TO SWEEP THROUGH THE FARM YARD FOR TURKEYS HENS DUCKS AND GEESE FELL A PREY TO IT
4830-25898-0044_3486-166446-0040 AND PEEPING DOWN FROM HER PERCH SAW A GREAT HAND GLIDE ALONG THE ROOST CLUTCH HER BELOVED MOTHER BY THE LEG AND PULL HER OFF SCREAMING DOLEFULLY
4830-25898-0046_322-124146-0032 IN THE MORNING FEW REMAINED AND BLOT FELT THAT SHE WAS A FORLORN ORPHAN A THOUGHT WHICH CAUSED HER TO SIT WITH HER HEAD UNDER HER WING FOR SEVERAL HOURS BROODING OVER HER SAD LOT
4830-25898-0047_1334-135589-0093 AND LONGING TO JOIN HER FAMILY IN SOME SAFE AND HAPPY LAND WHERE FOWLS LIVE IN PEACE SHE HAD HER WISH VERY SOON FOR ONE DAY WHEN THE FIRST SNOWFLAKES BEGAN TO FLUTTER
4830-25898-0049_4340-15220-0098 I LIVE AT THE RED FARM HOUSE OVER THE HILL ONLY I DON'T KNOW WHICH ROAD TO TAKE I'LL SHOW YOU COME AT ONCE FOR NIGHT IS COMING ON AND THE SNOW WILL SOON BE TOO DEEP FOR US SAID BLOT SO AWAY THEY WENT
4830-25898-0050_5789-57195-0011 BUT IT WAS A LONG WAY AND DUSK CAME ON BEFORE THE RED FARM HOUSE APPEARED NOW I'M SAFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WON'T YOU COME IN AND STAY ALL NIGHT MY MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU
4830-25898-0051_3699-19401-0016 SAID THE KIT RUBBING HER SOFT WHITE FACE AGAINST BLOT'S LITTLE BLACK BREAST
4830-25898-0052_5393-19219-0040 SO GOOD BY DEAR AND OFF TROTTED BLOT ALONG THE SNOWY ROAD HOPING TO GET HOME BEFORE THE HEN HOUSE DOOR WAS SHUT FASTER AND FASTER FELL THE SNOW DARKER AND DARKER GREW THE NIGHT
4830-25898-0053_200-126784-0000 AND COLDER AND COLDER BECAME POOR BLOT'S LITTLE FEET AS SHE WADED THROUGH THE DRIFTS THE FIRELIGHT WAS SHINING OUT INTO THE GLOOM
4830-25898-0054_1502-122619-0080 TO FIND ALL DOORS SHUT AND NO SHELTER LEFT FOR HER BUT THE BOUGH OF A LEAFLESS TREE TOO STIFF AND WEAK TO FLY UP SHE CREPT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE BRIGHT GLOW WHICH SHONE ACROSS THE DOOR STEP
4830-25904-0005_32-4137-0054 SO I THREW HIM SOME FRESH CLOVER AND WENT ON TO THE PELICANS I NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHAT HANDSOME BIRDS THEY WERE NOT GRACEFUL BUT WITH SUCH SNOWY PLUMAGE TINGED WITH PALE PINK AND FAINT YELLOW
4830-25904-0006_3168-173564-0009 THEY HAD JUST HAD THEIR BATH AND STOOD ARRANGING THEIR FEATHERS WITH THEIR GREAT BILLS
4830-25904-0007_7800-283478-0028 WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
4830-25904-0008_6454-120342-0008 AND THERE FOUND A SPLENDID SIGHT SIX LIONS AND LIONESSES IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAGES SITTING OR STANDING IN DIGNIFIED ATTITUDES AND EYEING THE SPECTATORS WITH A MILD EXPRESSION IN THEIR FINE EYES
4830-25904-0012_839-130898-0082 IT WAS A VERY LOUD AND LARGE PURR BUT NO FIRESIDE PUSSY COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER AND EVERY ONE LAUGHED AT THE SOUND THERE WERE PRETTY SPOTTED LEOPARDS PANTHERS AND SMALLER VARIETIES OF THE SAME SPECIES
4830-25904-0013_7113-86041-0087 I SAT WATCHING THEM A LONG TIME LONGING TO LET SOME OF THE WILD THINGS OUT FOR A GOOD RUN THEY SEEMED SO UNHAPPY BARRED IN THOSE SMALL DENS SUDDENLY THE LIONS BEGAN TO ROAR THE TIGERS TO SNARL
4830-25904-0015_7859-102518-0012 THIS WAS THEIR DINNER AND AS THEY WERE FED BUT ONCE A DAY THEY WERE RAVENOUS SUCH ROARS AND HOWLS AND CRIES AS AROSE WHILE THE MAN WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE LINE
4830-25904-0016_426-122819-0033 GAVE ONE A GOOD IDEA OF THE SOUNDS TO BE HEARD IN INDIAN FORESTS AND JUNGLES THE LIONS BEHAVED BEST FOR THEY ONLY PACED UP AND DOWN WITH AN OCCASIONAL CRY BUT THE TIGERS WERE QUITE FRANTIC
4830-25904-0019_1447-130552-0015 AS IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF WILD BEASTS WERE AFTER HER
4830-25904-0020_4441-76250-0022 THE TIGERS SNARLED AND FOUGHT AND TORE AND GOT SO SAVAGE I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY WERE SAFELY SHUT UP IN A FEW MINUTES NOTHING BUT WHITE BONES REMAINED AND THEN THEY HOWLED FOR MORE
4830-25904-0023_669-129061-0040 HE WOULDN'T TOUCH HIS DINNER BUT LAY DOWN NEAR HER WITH THE LUMP BETWEEN HIS PAWS AS IF GUARDING IT FOR HER AND THERE I LEFT HIM PATIENTLY WAITING IN SPITE OF HIS HUNGER TILL HIS MATE COULD SHARE IT WITH HIM
4830-25904-0025_89-219-0049 AS A CONTRAST TO THE WILD BEASTS I WENT TO SEE THE MONKEYS WHO LIVED IN A FINE LARGE HOUSE ALL TO THEMSELVES HERE WAS EVERY VARIETY FROM THE GREAT UGLY CHIMPANZEE TO THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOWS
4830-25904-0026_5339-14134-0038 WHO PLAYED LIKE BOYS AND CUT UP ALL SORTS OF CAPERS A MAMMA SAT TENDING HER BABY AND LOOKING SO LIKE A LITTLE OLD WOMAN THAT I LAUGHED TILL THE GRAY MONKEY WITH THE BLUE NOSE SCOLDED AT ME
4830-25904-0027_5514-19192-0015 HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
4830-25904-0029_4340-15220-0066 AND KEPT TRYING TO SWING LIKE THE OTHERS FORGETTING THAT THE STRONG CURLY END WAS WHAT HE HELD ON WITH HE WOULD RUN UP THE BARE BOUGHS AND GIVE A JUMP EXPECTING TO CATCH AND SWING BUT THE LAME TAIL WOULDN'T HOLD HIM AND DOWN HE'D GO
4830-25904-0031_6209-34599-0004 AND FINALLY HE'D EXAMINE HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL AND APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM THE FUNNY EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND I ENJOYED SEEING HIM VERY MUCH
4830-25904-0033_8797-294123-0011 SINCE I HAD A TAME GREEN ONE WHO LIVED UNDER THE DOOR STEP AND WOULD COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME ON SUNNY DAYS THESE SNAKES I FOUND VERY INTERESTING ONLY THEY GOT UNDER THEIR BLANKETS AND WOULDN'T COME OUT AND I WASN'T ALLOWED TO POKE THEM
4830-25904-0037_7800-283492-0020 AS I STOOD WONDERING IF THE BIG WORM COULD BE UNDER THE LITTLE FLAT BLANKET BEFORE ME THE BRANCH BEGAN TO MOVE ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A START I SAW A LIMB SWING DOWN TO STARE AT ME WITH THE BOA'S GLITTERING EYES
4830-25904-0038_8063-274116-0028 AND LAY SO STILL I HAD NOT SEEN HIM TILL HE CAME TO TAKE A LOOK AT ME A VERY VILLAINOUS LOOKING REPTILE HE WAS AND I FELT GRATEFUL THAT I DIDN'T LIVE IN A COUNTRY
4830-25904-0039_4859-29340-0023 WHERE SUCH UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOURS MIGHT POP IN UPON YOU UNEXPECTEDLY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A PROMENADE AND SHOW ME HIS SIZE WHICH SEEMED IMMENSE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
4830-25904-0041_5049-25947-0080 WHICH I HADN'T THE HEART TO STAY AND SEE HIM DEVOUR ALIVE I WAS WALKING TOWARD THE CAMEL'S PAGODA WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LONG DARK CURLING THING CAME OVER MY SHOULDER AND I FELT WARM BREATH IN MY FACE IT'S THE BOA I THOUGHT
4830-25904-0042_458-126305-0007 MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOME CHILDREN RIDING ON THE ELEPHANT WHOSE TRUNK HAD FRIGHTENED ME HE HAD POLITELY TRIED TO TELL ME TO CLEAR THE WAY WHICH I CERTAINLY HAD DONE WITH ALL SPEED PICKING MYSELF OUT OF THE HEDGE
4830-25904-0046_8324-286681-0001 AND IN AN IMMENSE WIRE COVERED AVIARY ALL SORTS OF BRILLIANT BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT AS GAILY AS IF AT HOME ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES WAS A SEA COW WHO LIVED IN A TANK OF SALT WATER
4830-25904-0047_696-93314-0028 AND CAME AT THE KEEPER'S CALL TO KISS HIM AND FLOUNDER ON ITS FLIPPERS ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE TANK AFTER A FISH IT WAS VERY LIKE A SEAL ONLY MUCH LARGER AND HAD FOUR FINS INSTEAD OF TWO
4830-25904-0049_3983-5331-0020 THE GREAT POLAR BEAR LIVED NEXT DOOR AND SPENT HIS TIME SPLASHING IN AND OUT OF A POOL OF WATER OR SITTING ON A BLOCK OF ICE PANTING AS IF THE MILD SPRING DAY WAS BLAZING MIDSUMMER
4830-25904-0050_8098-278278-0031 HE LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY AND I THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT THEY DIDN'T INVENT A BIG REFRIGERATOR FOR HIM THESE ARE NOT HALF OF THE WONDERFUL CREATURES I SAW
4853-27670-0000_3440-171009-0012 I LAY FOR A LONG WHILE INSENSIBLE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED MY MIND INSTEAD OF DYING IN THAT SWOON I MUST EVER ACCOUNT AS THE GREATEST WONDER OF A LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN WANTING IN THE MARVELLOUS
4853-27670-0003_1867-148436-0025 IT WAS INTENSELY DARK THE BINNACLE LAMP WAS EXTINGUISHED AND THE LIGHT IN THE CABIN BURNED TOO DIMLY TO THROW THE FAINTEST COLOUR UPON THE HATCHWAY ONE THING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE GALE HAD BROKEN AND BLEW NO MORE THAN A FRESH BREEZE
4853-27670-0004_4481-17498-0039 THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
4853-27670-0008_6836-61803-0006 WHAT HAS COME TO PASS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL MY COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD CERTAINLY FIVE MEN AT LEAST WERE LIVING BEFORE WE FOULED THE ICE AND AGAIN I CRIED OUT IS THERE ANY ONE ALIVE
4853-27670-0009_233-134440-0001 MY LONELINESS WAS MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER CONDITION OF MY SITUATION IT WAS DREADFUL TO BE STANDING NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD IN UTTER DARKNESS
4853-27670-0010_32-21625-0000 IT WAS DREADFUL I SAY TO BE THUS PLACED AND TO FEEL THAT I WAS IN THE HEART OF THE RUDEST MOST DESOLATE SPACE OF SEA IN THE WORLD INTO WHICH THE COMMERCE OF THE EARTH DISPATCHED BUT FEW SHIPS ALL THE YEAR ROUND
4853-27670-0012_8797-294123-0066 EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
4853-27670-0013_839-130898-0016 MISERY AND HORROR WERE WITHIN THAT SHADOW AND BEYOND IT NOTHING THAT MY SPIRIT COULD LOOK UP TO I STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS AS ONE STUNNED AND THEN MY MANHOOD TRAINED TO SOME PURPOSE BY THE USAGE OF THE SEA
4853-27670-0014_3607-29116-0025 REASSERTED ITSELF AND MAYBE I ALSO GOT SOME SLENDER COMFORT FROM OBSERVING THAT DULL AND HEAVY AS WAS THE MOTION OF THE BRIG THERE WAS YET THE BUOYANCY OF VITALITY IN HER MANNER OF MOUNTING THE SEAS AND THAT AFTER ALL
4853-27670-0015_8014-112586-0010 HER CASE MIGHT NOT BE SO DESPERATE AS WAS THREATENED BY THE WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND PRECIPITATED PAST THE ICEBERG AT MOMENTS WHEN SHE PLUNGED THE WHITENESS OF THE WATER CREAMING UPON THE SURGES ON EITHER HAND
4853-27670-0016_8014-112602-0013 BY PREVENTING THE SEAS WHICH WASHED ON TO THE FORECASTLE FROM CASCADING WITH THEIR FORMER VIOLENCE AFT ALSO THAT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE MAIN AND TOP MASTS LAY UPON THE LARBOARD RAIL AND OVER THE SIDE
4853-27670-0019_8238-274553-0047 I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
4853-27670-0021_200-124139-0019 I TOOK FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN A STOUT CLOAK AND THREW IT OVER ME ENVELOPING MY HEAD WHICH I HAD CASED IN A WARM FUR CAP WITH THE HOOD OF IT AND THUS EQUIPPED I LIGHTED A SMALL HAND LANTERN THAT WAS USED ON DARK NIGHTS FOR HEAVING THE LOG
4853-27670-0023_39-121915-0012 BUT I NOW NOTICED THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE HAMPER BEING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE BALANCED THE LIST THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HER SHIFTED BALLAST AND THAT SHE FLOATED ON A LEVEL KEEL WITH HER BOWS FAIR AT THE SEA
4853-27670-0024_7278-104730-0016 I MOVED WITH EXTREME CAUTION CASTING THE LANTERN LIGHT BEFORE ME SOMETIMES STARTING AT A SOUND THAT RESEMBLED A GROAN THEN STOPPING TO STEADY MYSELF DURING SOME PARTICULAR WILD LEAP OF THE HULL
4853-27670-0025_460-172359-0058 UNTIL COMING ABREAST OF THE MAIN HATCH THE RAYS OF THE LANTERN STRUCK UPON A MAN'S BODY WHICH ON MY BRINGING THE FLAME TO HIS FACE PROVED TO BE CAPTAIN ROSY THERE WAS A WOUND OVER HIS RIGHT BROW
4853-27670-0026_4481-17498-0007 AND AS IF THAT HAD NOT SUFFICED TO SLAY HIM THE FALL OF THE MASTS HAD IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER WHIPPED A ROPE SEVERAL TIMES ROUND HIS BODY BINDING HIS ARMS AND ENCIRCLING HIS THROAT SO TIGHTLY
4853-27670-0028_1723-141149-0084 FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
4853-27670-0029_229-130880-0093 I CROSSED TO THE STARBOARD SIDE WHERE THE DECK WAS COMPARATIVELY CLEAR AND FOUND THE BODY OF A SEAMAN NAMED ABRAHAM WISE NEAR THE FORE HATCH
4853-27670-0030_7367-86737-0015 NO LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE COMMAND OF COULD PUT BEFORE YOU THE HORROR THAT POSSESSED ME AS I SAT MEDITATING UPON MY SITUATION AND RECALLING THE FACES OF THE DEAD THE WIND WAS RAPIDLY FALLING AND WITH IT THE SEA
4853-27670-0033_4406-16882-0014 NEVERTHELESS HER CONTINUING TO FLOAT IN HER MISERABLY TORN AND MANGLED CONDITION WAS SO GREAT A MIRACLE THAT SPITE OF MY POOR SHIPMATES HAVING PERISHED AND MY OWN STATE BEING AS HOPELESS AS THE SKY WAS STARLESS
4853-27670-0034_7078-271888-0105 TO JUDGE BY THE SOUND OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE VESSEL THAT SHE WAS FILLING I KNEW WELL YET NOT LEAKING SO RAPIDLY BUT THAT HAD OUR CREW BEEN PRESERVED WE MIGHT EASILY HAVE KEPT HER FREE
4853-27670-0035_1867-148436-0006 I HAD NOTICED THE JOLLY BOAT BOTTOM UP NEAR THE STARBOARD GANGWAY AND SO FAR AS I COULD MAKE OUT BY THROWING THE DULL LANTERN LIGHT UPON HER SHE WAS SOUND BUT I COULD NOT HAVE LAUNCHED HER WITHOUT SEEING WHAT I WAS DOING
4853-27671-0000_2092-145709-0014 THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
4853-27671-0001_1578-140045-0028 I HAD AT ONE TIME DURING THE BLACK HOURS STRUCK INTO A MOURNFUL CALCULATION AND RECKONED THAT THE BRIG WOULD FLOAT SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE
4853-27671-0002_4014-186183-0014 AND A DEEP OF ROLLING SAPPHIRE I STARTED WITH SUDDEN TERROR TO OBSERVE HOW CLOSE THE COVERING BOARD SAT UPON THE WATER AND HOW THE HEAD OF EVERY SWELL RAN PAST AS HIGH AS THE BULWARK RAIL
4853-27671-0004_3240-131231-0033 ONE EXTRAORDINARY STROKE I QUICKLY DETECTED THE JOLLY BOAT HAD LAIN STOWED IN THE LONG BOAT IT WAS THUS WE CARRIED THOSE BOATS THE LITTLE ONE LYING SNUGLY ENOUGH IN THE OTHER THE SEA THAT HAD FLOODED OUR DECKS
4853-27671-0005_7794-295955-0026 HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
4853-27671-0007_3168-173565-0004 AND SO MADE A TACKLE BY THE HELP OF WHICH I TURNED THE JOLLY BOAT OVER I THEN WITH A HANDSPIKE PRISED HER NOSE TO THE GANGWAY SECURED A BUNCH OF ROPE ON EITHER SIDE HER TO ACT AS FENDERS OR BUFFERS
4853-27671-0010_200-124139-0032 I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
4853-27671-0011_2007-149877-0046 EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
4853-27671-0015_7635-105409-0041 HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
4853-27671-0017_6476-57446-0039 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0019_8629-261139-0000 I THREW THE OAR OVER THE STERN OF THE BOAT TO KEEP HER NEAR TO THE BRIG NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE I DESIRED TO SEE THE LAST OF HER
4853-27671-0020_8468-286673-0033 INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
4853-27671-0021_3983-5331-0047 AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
4853-27671-0025_5104-33406-0019 AND SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MY MIND THAT IMAGINATION MIGHT QUICKLY HAVE WORKED THE APPARITION HAD IT LINGERED INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE UNSETTLING OF MY REASON I ROSE FROM THE SEAT ON TO WHICH I HAD SUNK AND LOOSED THE SAIL
4853-27671-0028_89-218-0049 ERE I COULD HEAVE A CIVILIZED COAST OR A HABITABLE ISLAND INTO VIEW AT THE START I HAD A MIND TO STEER NORTH WEST AND BLOW AS THE WIND WOULD SUFFER INTO THE SOUTH SEA
4853-27671-0032_4014-186175-0038 I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
4853-27671-0033_909-131045-0022 AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
4853-27671-0036_8630-305213-0029 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
4853-27671-0037_481-123719-0022 WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
4853-27671-0040_2691-156750-0021 IT UTTERED A STRANGE SALT CRY THE VERY NOTE OF A GUST OF WIND SPLITTING UPON A ROPE FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND AFTER A TURN OR TWO
4853-29413-0001_1098-133695-0062 THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
4853-29413-0007_7780-274562-0013 EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
4853-29413-0008_2196-174172-0001 IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
4853-29413-0010_1034-121119-0051 WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
4853-29413-0011_2843-152918-0019 THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
4853-29413-0012_4830-25898-0017 THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
4853-29413-0015_7780-274562-0085 BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
4853-29413-0016_6147-34605-0040 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4853-29413-0018_4267-78186-0002 THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
4853-29413-0020_4267-72637-0030 THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
4853-29413-0022_5163-39921-0013 SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
4853-29413-0024_7113-86041-0008 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0029_2182-181183-0004 WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
4853-29413-0030_587-41611-0012 I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
4853-29413-0032_887-123290-0013 AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
4859-22176-0004_1841-159771-0015 IF IT DID IT WAS ONLY AS A PLEASANT MEMORY OF THE DISTANT PAST HE FELT HIMSELF NOT ONLY FREE FROM SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS BUT ALSO FROM THAT FEELING WHICH IT SEEMED TO HIM HE HAD AROUSED IN HIMSELF ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE HEARD FROM THE DRUBETSKOYS
4859-22176-0010_322-124146-0035 YES SIR SAID THE MAN PLEASE STEP INTO THE PORTRAIT GALLERY A FEW MINUTES LATER THE FOOTMAN RETURNED
4859-22176-0012_5022-29411-0050 GLANCING AT THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS THE PRINCESS ROSE QUICKLY TO MEET HIM AND HELD OUT HER HAND YES SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIS ALTERED FACE AFTER HE HAD KISSED HER HAND SO THIS IS HOW WE MEET AGAIN
4859-22176-0015_125-121124-0033 AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN ONE IS TALKING FELT SOMEHOW THAT THIS COMPANION IN THE BLACK DRESS WAS A GOOD KIND EXCELLENT CREATURE WHO WOULD NOT HINDER HIS CONVERSING FREELY WITH PRINCESS MARY BUT WHEN HE MENTIONED THE ROSTOVS PRINCESS MARY'S FACE EXPRESSED STILL GREATER EMBARRASSMENT
4859-22176-0016_5750-35690-0026 SHE AGAIN GLANCED RAPIDLY FROM PIERRE'S FACE TO THAT OF THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS AND SAID DO YOU REALLY NOT RECOGNIZE HER PIERRE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE COMPANION'S PALE DELICATE FACE WITH ITS BLACK EYES AND PECULIAR MOUTH AND SOMETHING NEAR TO HIM LONG FORGOTTEN AND MORE THAN SWEET
4859-22176-0019_8425-291444-0002 AND OF WHICH HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN THINKING ESPECIALLY AT THAT MOMENT IT SUFFUSED HIM SEIZED HIM AND ENVELOPED HIM COMPLETELY WHEN SHE SMILED DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER
4859-22176-0020_831-130739-0014 AT THAT MOMENT PIERRE INVOLUNTARILY BETRAYED TO HER TO PRINCESS MARY AND ABOVE ALL TO HIMSELF A SECRET OF WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN UNAWARE HE FLUSHED JOYFULLY YET WITH PAINFUL DISTRESS HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS AGITATION BUT THE MORE HE TRIED TO HIDE IT THE MORE CLEARLY
4859-22176-0023_8095-274346-0015 BUT HE HAD FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HER BECAUSE THE CHANGE IN HER SINCE HE LAST SAW HER WAS IMMENSE SHE HAD GROWN THIN AND PALE BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT MADE HER UNRECOGNIZABLE SHE WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE AT THE MOMENT HE ENTERED
4859-22176-0024_3214-167606-0026 BECAUSE ON THAT FACE WHOSE EYES HAD ALWAYS SHONE WITH A SUPPRESSED SMILE OF THE JOY OF LIFE NOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED AND GLANCED AT HER THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SHADOW OF A SMILE ONLY HER EYES WERE KINDLY ATTENTIVE AND SADLY INTERROGATIVE
4859-26870-0002_311-124404-0011 ON RETURNING TO LUNCH NICHOLAS WENT UP TO HIS WIFE WHO SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT LOW OVER HER EMBROIDERY FRAME AND AS USUAL BEGAN TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THAT MORNING AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SPOKE OF THE BOGUCHAROVO ELDER COUNTESS MARY TURNED RED AND THEN PALE
4859-26870-0003_909-131045-0012 SUCH AN INSOLENT SCOUNDREL HE CRIED GROWING HOT AGAIN AT THE MERE RECOLLECTION OF HIM IF HE HAD TOLD ME HE WAS DRUNK AND DID NOT SEE BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MARY HE SUDDENLY ASKED
4859-26870-0004_2196-170379-0012 WHY WHATEVER IS THE MATTER MY DEAREST THE LOOKS OF THE PLAIN COUNTESS MARY ALWAYS IMPROVED WHEN SHE WAS IN TEARS SHE NEVER CRIED FROM PAIN OR VEXATION BUT ALWAYS FROM SORROW OR PITY AND WHEN SHE WEPT HER RADIANT EYES ACQUIRED AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM
4859-26870-0006_5022-29405-0017 HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE WAS WEEPING ABOUT BUT COULD NOT IN HIS HEART AT ONCE AGREE WITH HER THAT WHAT HE HAD REGARDED FROM CHILDHOOD AS QUITE AN EVERYDAY EVENT WAS WRONG IS IT JUST SENTIMENTALITY OLD WIVES TALES OR IS SHE RIGHT HE ASKED HIMSELF
4859-26870-0007_887-123289-0018 MARY HE SAID SOFTLY GOING UP TO HER IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN I GIVE YOU MY WORD NEVER HE REPEATED IN A TREMBLING VOICE LIKE A BOY ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS
4859-26870-0009_2002-139469-0084 I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR IT SHAN'T OCCUR AGAIN AND LET THIS ALWAYS BE A REMINDER TO ME AND HE POINTED TO THE BROKEN RING AFTER THAT WHEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS VILLAGE ELDERS OR STEWARDS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS FACE AND HIS FISTS BEGAN TO CLENCH
4859-26870-0011_4788-91208-0007 MARY YOU MUST DESPISE ME HE WOULD SAY I DESERVE IT YOU SHOULD GO GO AWAY AT ONCE IF YOU DON'T FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTROL YOURSELF SHE WOULD REPLY SADLY TRYING TO COMFORT HER HUSBAND AMONG THE GENTRY OF THE PROVINCE NICHOLAS WAS RESPECTED BUT NOT LIKED
4859-26870-0013_8226-274369-0029 LEAVING HOME FOR A MONTH OR EVEN TWO WITH HIS HUNT IN WINTER HE VISITED HIS OTHER VILLAGES OR SPENT HIS TIME READING THE BOOKS HE READ WERE CHIEFLY HISTORICAL AND ON THESE HE SPENT A CERTAIN SUM EVERY YEAR
4859-26870-0018_7226-86965-0009 BUT OFTEN FELT ILL WILL TOWARD HER WHICH SHE COULD NOT OVERCOME ONCE SHE HAD A TALK WITH HER FRIEND NATASHA ABOUT SONYA AND ABOUT HER OWN INJUSTICE TOWARD HER YOU KNOW SAID NATASHA YOU HAVE READ THE GOSPELS A GREAT DEAL THERE IS A PASSAGE IN THEM THAT JUST FITS SONYA WHAT ASKED COUNTESS MARY SURPRISED
4859-26870-0020_3982-182255-0031 SHE IS A STERILE FLOWER YOU KNOW LIKE SOME STRAWBERRY BLOSSOMS
4859-26870-0022_8629-261139-0042 AND HAD GROWN QUITE RECONCILED TO HER LOT AS A STERILE FLOWER SHE SEEMED TO BE FOND NOT SO MUCH OF INDIVIDUALS AS OF THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE LIKE A CAT SHE HAD ATTACHED HERSELF NOT TO THE PEOPLE BUT TO THE HOME
4859-26870-0023_458-126294-0001 SHE WAITED ON THE OLD COUNTESS PETTED AND SPOILED THE CHILDREN WAS ALWAYS READY TO RENDER THE SMALL SERVICES FOR WHICH SHE HAD A GIFT AND ALL THIS WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACCEPTED FROM HER WITH INSUFFICIENT GRATITUDE THE COUNTRY SEAT AT BALD HILLS HAD BEEN REBUILT THOUGH NOT ON THE SAME SCALE AS UNDER THE OLD PRINCE
4859-26870-0025_83-9960-0003 MADE BY THEIR OWN SERF CARPENTERS OUT OF THEIR OWN BIRCHWOOD THE HOUSE WAS SPACIOUS AND HAD ROOMS FOR THE HOUSE SERFS AND APARTMENTS FOR VISITORS WHOLE FAMILIES OF THE ROSTOVS AND BOLKONSKIS RELATIONS SOMETIMES CAME TO BALD HILLS WITH SIXTEEN HORSES AND DOZENS OF SERVANTS AND STAYED FOR MONTHS
4859-29340-0001_60-121082-0039 OR IN GENERAL OF THE PERSONS THEY DESCRIBE THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THIS KIND OF HISTORIAN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT FORCE CAUSES EVENTS TO HAPPEN ARE SATISFACTORY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE IS BUT ONE HISTORIAN TO EACH EVENT
4859-29340-0002_4830-25904-0018 AS SOON AS HISTORIANS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES AND TENDENCIES BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALL MEANING FOR THIS FORCE IS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL NOT ONLY DIFFERENTLY BUT OFTEN IN QUITE CONTRADICTORY WAYS
4859-29340-0003_233-134440-0032 ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY ALEXANDER'S
4859-29340-0004_6529-62554-0040 BESIDES THIS HISTORIANS OF THAT KIND CONTRADICT EACH OTHER EVEN IN THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE FORCE ON WHICH THE AUTHORITY OF SOME PARTICULAR PERSON WAS BASED THIERS A BONAPARTIST SAYS THAT NAPOLEON'S POWER WAS BASED ON HIS VIRTUE AND GENIUS
4859-29340-0007_254-127705-0033 THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS BUT AS THE RESULTANT OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VARIOUSLY DIRECTED FORCES IN DESCRIBING A WAR OR THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE A GENERAL HISTORIAN LOOKS FOR THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT
4859-29340-0008_250-140277-0000 NOT IN THE POWER OF ONE MAN BUT IN THE INTERACTION OF MANY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE POWER OF HISTORICAL PERSONAGES REPRESENTED AS THE PRODUCT OF MANY FORCES CAN NO LONGER IT WOULD SEEM
4859-29340-0010_6476-57446-0046 IN THEIR EXPOSITION AN HISTORIC CHARACTER IS FIRST THE PRODUCT OF HIS TIME AND HIS POWER ONLY THE RESULTANT OF VARIOUS FORCES AND THEN HIS POWER IS ITSELF A FORCE PRODUCING EVENTS GERVINUS SCHLOSSER AND OTHERS FOR INSTANCE
4859-29340-0012_6367-65536-0004 AND THAT THE VERY IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE ARRESTED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY NAPOLEON'S CAPRICE THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE PRODUCED NAPOLEON'S POWER BUT NAPOLEON'S POWER SUPPRESSED THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION
4859-29340-0015_6078-54007-0028 AND SO TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTANT FORCES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO ADMIT IN ADDITION TO THE INSUFFICIENT COMPONENTS ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED FORCE AFFECTING THE RESULTANT ACTION
4859-29340-0017_2764-36617-0029 TRIES TO PROVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN AND THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS WERE DUE TO OTHER THINGS BESIDE ALEXANDER'S WILL SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF STEIN METTERNICH MADAME DE STAEL TALLEYRAND
4859-29340-0018_1334-135589-0022 FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND AND OTHERS THE HISTORIAN EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS TALLEYRAND CHATEAUBRIAND AND THE REST BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND
4859-29340-0019_2836-5354-0044 TALLEYRAND MADAME DE STAEL AND THE OTHERS EVIDENTLY DOES NOT EQUAL THE RESULTANT NAMELY THE PHENOMENON OF MILLIONS OF FRENCHMEN SUBMITTING TO THE BOURBONS THAT CHATEAUBRIAND MADAME DE STAEL
4859-29340-0020_7511-102419-0023 BUT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS AND THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN HOW FROM THESE RELATIONS OF THEIRS THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RESULTED THAT IS HOW COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO ONE A GAVE A RESULTANT EQUAL TO A THOUSAND TIMES A
4859-29340-0021_1363-135842-0042 THE HISTORIAN IS AGAIN OBLIGED TO FALL BACK ON POWER THE FORCE HE HAD DENIED AND TO RECOGNIZE IT AS THE RESULTANT OF THE FORCES THAT IS HE HAS TO ADMIT AN UNEXPLAINED FORCE ACTING ON THE RESULTANT
4859-29340-0022_3526-176653-0017 AND THAT IS JUST WHAT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS DO AND CONSEQUENTLY
4859-29340-0025_4137-11702-0059 A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
4859-29340-0028_3699-47246-0009 ONLY BY A GREAT STRETCH CAN ONE ADMIT THAT THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES AND IN NO CASE CAN ONE ADMIT THAT INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY CONTROLS PEOPLE'S ACTIONS
4859-29340-0034_7517-100429-0019 JUST AS SUCH A CONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCE HANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE
4859-29340-0035_8609-262281-0010 ONE THAT HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY LEARNED MEN AND SO IT IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE FOR THEM TO THINK THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR CLASS SUPPLIES THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ALL HUMANITY JUST AS A SIMILAR BELIEF IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE
4859-29340-0036_405-130895-0000 TO TRADERS AGRICULTURISTS AND SOLDIERS IF THEY DO NOT EXPRESS IT THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE TRADERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT WRITE HISTORY AND TWO THAT SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY ENLIGHTENMENT CIVILIZATION CULTURE IDEAS ARE ALL INDISTINCT
4859-29340-0037_1970-10594-0043 INDEFINITE CONCEPTIONS UNDER WHOSE BANNER IT IS VERY EASY TO USE WORDS HAVING A STILL LESS DEFINITE MEANING AND WHICH CAN THEREFORE BE READILY INTRODUCED INTO ANY THEORY BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE INTRINSIC QUALITY OF HISTORIES OF THIS KIND
4859-29340-0041_302-123523-0010 THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE INVOLUNTARILY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES AND SHOW THAT THE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN HISTORY
4898-20016-0000_3259-158083-0028 HASTENING TO BEGIN HIS WORK THE TOWN IS AN OLD FASHIONED ONE AND ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVANCE OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH FESTIVAL IS NO LONGER FROWNED UPON AS IN YEARS PAST YET IT HAS BEEN LITTLE REGARDED
4898-20016-0003_2092-145706-0061 WHICH NATHAN ATTENDS STANDS IN THE SAME SQUARE WITH HIS SHOP AND NEARLY OPPOSITE IT WAS CLOSED AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND A RECENT SNOW HAD HEAPED THE STEPS AND ROOF AND LOADED THE WINDOWS
4898-20016-0005_7505-83618-0007 ALTHOUGH A GOOD DEAL STOOPING WITH LONG STRAIGHT AND VERY WHITE HAIR FALLING OVER HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM THE BLACK VELVET CAP AS IT APPEARED THAT HE WORE
4898-20016-0006_4406-16883-0005 AS TO WHO THE STRANGER COULD BE WHEN HE BEHELD HIM TURN IN BETWEEN THE POSTS BY THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE CHURCH TREAD LIGHTLY OVER THE SNOW AND UP THE STEPS AND KNOCK HASTILY AND VIGOROUSLY AT THE CHURCH DOOR
4898-20016-0009_322-124147-0001 HE DID NOT CARE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE STRANGER INTO THE CHURCH BUT HE REMEMBERED A SHED SO PLACED AGAINST THE BUILDING NEAR THE FARTHER END THAT HE HAD OFTEN WHEN A CHILD AT SOME PERIL INDEED CLIMBED UPON ITS TOP
4898-20016-0010_8324-286682-0027 AND LOOKED INTO THE CHURCH THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW AT ONE SIDE OF THE PULPIT FOR THIS HE STARTED BUT HE DID NOT FAIL TO RUN ACROSS THE SQUARE AND LEAP OVER THE CHURCH GATE AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED
4898-20016-0011_2182-181183-0006 IN ORDER TO GATHER WARMTH AND COURAGE FOR THE ATTEMPT WHEN NATHAN STODDARD CLIMBED UPON THE OLD SHED AND PRESSED HIS FACE AGAINST THE GLASS OF THE LITTLE CHURCH WINDOW HE HAD AT FIRST ONLY A CONFUSED IMPRESSION
4898-20016-0012_254-12312-0020 AS HE GLARED THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO THE OLD KIRK OF ALLOWAY THE GREAT CHANDELIER OF THE CHURCH WAS PARTLY LIGHTED AND THERE WERE BESIDES MANY CANDLES AND LANTERNS BURNING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM
4898-20016-0013_7278-246956-0024 WHO WERE DRESSED IN BREECHES AND RUFFLED SHIRTS AND HOOPED PETTICOATS AND TOWERING HEAD DRESSES SUCH AS HE HAD ONLY SEEN IN OLD PICTURES THEY WERE MOUNTED UPON BENCHES AND LADDERS
4898-20016-0014_328-129766-0022 AND BOARDS LAID ALONG THE TOPS OF THE PEWS AND WERE APPARENTLY JUST COMPLETING THE DECORATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS ALREADY DRESSED WITH GREEN WITH LITTLE TREES IN THE CORNERS AND WITH GREEN LETTERS UPON THE WALLS
4898-20016-0016_328-129766-0087 IT WAS NOT UNTIL NATHAN STODDARD HAD LOOKED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UPON THIS SPECTACLE THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS WITNESS OF ANY THING MORE THAN NATURAL THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SO HOME LIKE AN AIR
4898-20016-0017_6019-3185-0013 THE MORE HE WAS FILLED FOR ALL THEIR APPEARANCE OF YOUTH AND THEIR SIMPLE MANNERS WITH A STRANGE SORT OF VENERATION THE SWEET AND CHEERFUL FACES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SEEMED TO GROW AWFULLY CALM
4898-20016-0020_6531-61334-0080 AND SO THEY KEPT PLAYING WITH THE FESTOONS AND STEPPING ABOUT THE PEWS TO PLEASE HIM NATHAN FELT A COLD THRILL PARTLY FROM PLEASURE AND PARTLY FROM AWE RUNNING UP HIS BACK AND A STRONG PAIN ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD
4898-20016-0021_4014-186175-0025 UNTIL HE FELT THAT HE WAS NEAR SWOONING AND LIKE TO FALL AND HE CLUNG DESPERATELY TO HIS HOLD WHEN THE FIT WAS OVER HE DARED VENTURE NO MORE BUT HASTENED TO THE GROUND
4898-20016-0027_6081-42010-0014 AND DROVE ROUND INTO THE SQUARE TO THE SHOP OF NATHAN STODDARD THERE IS MUSIC TO DAY IN OUR CHURCH NATHAN HE CRIED TO THE YOUNG SADDLER WHAT CAN IT MEAN BUT NATHAN ANSWERED NOT A WORD HE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE HEAD
4898-20016-0028_4297-13009-0027 AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
4898-20016-0030_60-121082-0060 SAID NATHAN NOT VENTURING A GLANCE HIMSELF MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED AND HAD NOT NATHAN'S ARM BEEN ABOUT HIS BODY HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS HOLD IN SHEER AMAZEMENT THE BUILDING WAS CROWDED AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN IT BEFORE
4898-20016-0032_1926-147987-0015 IT WAS SAID TO BE A PORTRAIT OF A MINISTER IN THE TOWN WHO LIVED IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IS STILL REMEMBERED FOR HIS VIRTUES THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN'S FACE COMPLETELY STILLED THE AGITATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER
4898-20016-0035_7447-91187-0002 ROSE HIGH AND LOUD WHILE A GREAT THUNDERING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CHURCH ANNOUNCED THAT THE PEOPLE BELOW HAD ALSO CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC AND WERE CLAMOROUS FOR ADMISSION
4898-20016-0036_1594-135914-0093 MISTER DUDLEY HASTENED ROUND TO PREVENT THEIR CAUSING ANY DISTURBANCE TO THE CONGREGATION WITHIN BUT HE CAME ONLY IN TIME TO SEE THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND TO BE BORNE IN WITH THE CROWD ALL GAZED ABOUT IN WONDER
4898-20016-0037_3240-131231-0032 HAD BEEN FAIRLY DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS BY SPIRIT HANDS WHEN MISTER DUDLEY REACHED HIS HOME AFTER THE WONDER HAD IN PART SPENT ITSELF HE FOUND THAT AN ENORMOUS CHRISTMAS PIE
4898-20016-0039_4640-19188-0039 IN A TREMULOUS BUT VERY KIND VOICE GIVE YOUR MASTER THE CHRISTMAS BLESSING OF AN OLD PURITAN MINISTER HOW THE MEANING OF THIS MESSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISTER DUDLEY HAD NOT THE EVENTS WE HAVE TOLD DISCLOSED IT
4898-28461-0000_1970-28415-0031 THE MOST INTERESTING OF THE SHORT EXCURSIONS WE MADE FROM FORT WRANGELL WAS THE ONE UP THE STICKEEN RIVER TO THE HEAD OF STEAM NAVIGATION FROM MT SAINT ELIAS THE COAST RANGE EXTENDS IN A BROAD LOFTY CHAIN
4898-28461-0005_26-495-0063 THAT LINE THE BANKS OF THE RIVERS OR EVEN STRETCHING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE MAIN CANYONS COMPELLING THE RIVERS TO FIND A CHANNEL BENEATH THEM THE STICKEEN WAS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN OF THE RIVERS THAT CROSS THE COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0007_6272-70191-0009 AND SOMETIMES TO TELEGRAPH CREEK FIFTEEN MILES FARTHER IT FIRST PURSUES A WESTERLY COURSE THROUGH GRASSY PLAINS DARKENED HERE AND THERE WITH GROVES OF SPRUCE AND PINE
4898-28461-0012_460-172359-0044 YOU ENJOY THE COUNTLESS REJOICING WATERFALLS THE GENTLE BREATHING OF WARM WINDS THE COLORS OF THE YOUNG LEAVES AND FLOWERS WHEN THE BEES ARE BUSY AND WAFTS OF FRAGRANCE ARE DRIFTING HITHER AND THITHER
4898-28461-0016_7447-91186-0022 AND THE SERENE COLOR GRANDEUR OF THE MORNING AND EVENING SKY IN SUMMER YOU FIND THE GROVES AND GARDENS IN FULL DRESS GLACIERS MELTING RAPIDLY UNDER SUNSHINE AND RAIN WATERFALLS IN ALL THEIR GLORY
4898-28461-0021_2092-145706-0009 WE ARRIVED BEFORE NOON AT THE OLD TRADING POST CALLED BUCK'S IN FRONT OF THE STICKEEN GLACIER AND REMAINED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WISHED A NEARER VIEW TO CROSS THE RIVER TO THE TERMINAL MORAINE
4898-28461-0026_7302-86814-0042 WHICH ENTERED THE MAIN CANYON FROM EITHER SIDE AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION AN INDIAN ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIS WIFE HAD HER SENT ADRIFT IN A CANOE DOWN THROUGH THE ICE TUNNEL EXPECTING THAT SHE WOULD TROUBLE HIM NO MORE
4898-28461-0027_3235-28433-0020 BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
4898-28461-0028_8838-298546-0004 AND HAD RECEDED TO A GREATER OR LESSER HEIGHT ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS HARDLY OUT OF SIGHT ERE YOU COME UPON ANOTHER THAT POURS A MAJESTIC CRYSTAL FLOOD
4898-28461-0029_2911-15045-0010 THROUGH THE EVERGREENS WHILE ALMOST EVERY HOLLOW AND TRIBUTARY CANYON CONTAINS A SMALLER ONE THE SIZE OF COURSE VARYING WITH THE EXTENT OF THE AREA DRAINED SOME ARE LIKE MERE SNOW BANKS OTHERS WITH THE BLUE ICE APPARENT
4898-28461-0031_446-123502-0026 WITH GOLD DUST IN THEIR EYES THIRTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS THE DIRT GLACIER THE SECOND IN SIZE ITS OUTLET IS A FINE STREAM ABOUNDING IN TROUT
4898-28461-0034_163-122947-0031 AND DEPOSITED ON THE FIRST OPEN LEVELS BELOW HERE TOO OCCURS A MARKED CHANGE IN CLIMATE AND CONSEQUENTLY IN FORESTS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THE WOODS ARE YOUNGER
4898-28461-0035_6019-3185-0069 AND ARE COMPOSED OF SMALLER TREES ABOUT A FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET HIGH MOSTLY TWO LEAVED PINES WHICH HOLD THEIR SEEDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THEY ARE RIPE THE WOODS HERE ARE WITHOUT A TRACE
4898-28461-0037_2416-152137-0001 WHERE THE FOREST HAS BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED THE RIVER BANK COTTONWOODS ARE ALSO SMALLER AND THE BIRCH AND CONTORTA PINES MINGLE FREELY WITH THE COAST HEMLOCK AND SPRUCE THE BIRCH IS COMMON ON THE LOWER SLOPES
4898-28461-0040_27-123349-0056 I SAW FINE SPECIMENS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH ON DEEP BOTTOM LAND A FEW MILES BELOW GLENORA THE TOPS OF SOME OF THEM WERE ALMOST COVERED WITH DENSE CLUSTERS OF YELLOW AND BROWN CONES
4898-28461-0041_248-130644-0036 WE REACHED THE OLD HUDSON'S BAY TRADING POST AT GLENORA ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD STOP HERE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WOULD MAKE AN EARLY START FOR WRANGELL
4898-28461-0045_7059-77900-0026 I THOUGHT THAT BY RAPID CLIMBING I COULD REACH THE SUMMIT BEFORE SUNSET IN TIME TO GET A GENERAL VIEW AND A FEW PENCIL SKETCHES AND MAKE MY WAY BACK TO THE STEAMER IN THE NIGHT MISTER YOUNG ONE OF THE MISSIONARIES ASKED PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY ME
4898-28461-0048_2182-181173-0020 AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES OPEN IN SOME PLACES AND IN OTHERS THATCHED WITH DWARF FIRS RESTING A MINUTE HERE AND THERE TO REFRESH OURSELVES WITH HUCKLEBERRIES WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN OPEN SPOTS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET
4898-28461-0050_696-93314-0054 WHERE THE ROCK WAS RAPIDLY DISINTEGRATING AND THE DANGER OF SLIPPING WAS GREAT I SHOUTED IN A WARNING VOICE BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THIS IS DANGEROUS MISTER YOUNG WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN OR TWO YARDS BEHIND ME BUT OUT OF SIGHT
4898-28461-0051_1363-139304-0034 I FOUND HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN SUCH A PLACE I THEREFORE TIED HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES WITH MY SUSPENDERS AND NECKTIE TO PREVENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INFLAMMATION FROM MOVEMENT I THEN LEFT HIM TELLING HIM TO LIE STILL
4898-28461-0052_6081-41997-0030 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
4898-28461-0053_730-358-0038 I REACHED UP TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY ONE OF HIS FEET AND GENTLY SLID HIM DOWN ON HIS BACK
4898-28461-0055_2384-152900-0088 AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
4898-28461-0059_2817-142371-0029 A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS A MILE CROSSED THE MORAINE BATHED HIS HEAD AT ONE OF THE OUTLET STREAMS AND AFTER MANY RESTS REACHED A DRY PLACE AND MADE A BRUSH FIRE I THEN WENT AHEAD LOOKING FOR AN OPEN WAY
4898-28461-0060_7190-90542-0039 AND A LEAFY BED BESIDE IT I NOW TOLD HIM I WOULD RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HASTEN BACK WITH HELP FROM THE BOAT AND CARRY HIM DOWN IN COMFORT BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY LEAVING HIM NO NO HE SAID I CAN WALK DOWN DON'T LEAVE ME
4898-28461-0064_2843-152918-0054 THEY MADE HASTE TO REPROACH HIM FOR HAVING GONE ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE WITH MUIR THESE FOOLISH ADVENTURES ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR MISTER MUIR THEY SAID BUT YOU MISTER YOUNG HAVE A WORK TO DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE A CHURCH
5022-29405-0000_3214-167606-0022 TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST READ IT AND CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE INTERVAL WHICH LEAVE ME FREE TO EXERCISE MY OWN DISCRETION AND TO LET THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SPEAK FOR ITSELF IF I AM ASKED WHAT IMPRESSION OF THE WRITER THOSE EXTRAORDINARY PAGES PRODUCED ON ME
5022-29405-0001_1334-135589-0058 I FEEL AT A LOSS HOW TO REPLY NOT ONE IMPRESSION BUT MANY IMPRESSIONS TROUBLED AND CONFUSED MY MIND CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE CONFESSION INCLINED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER WAS MAD BUT I ALTERED MY OPINION AT THE NEXT LEAF
5022-29405-0003_3947-13260-0009 AT ONE TIME HIS TONE IN WRITING OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND HIS ALLUSIONS TO HIS MOTHER WON MY SYMPATHY AND RESPECT AT ANOTHER TIME THE PICTURE OF HIMSELF IN HIS LATER YEARS AND THE DEFIANT MANNER IN WHICH HE PRESENTED IT
5022-29405-0005_5514-19192-0024 AT ONE POSITIVE CONCLUSION AS STRANGERS HE AND I HAD FIRST MET AS STRANGERS I WAS DETERMINED WE SHOULD REMAIN HAVING MADE UP MY MIND SO FAR THE NEXT THING TO DO WITH THE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL PIECE STRIKING MIDNIGHT WAS TO GO TO BED
5022-29405-0007_5808-48608-0037 THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
5022-29405-0008_8975-270782-0001 INFORMED ME THAT SHE WAS DYING WITH CURIOSITY SHE HAD HEARD FROM THE SERVANTS THAT I HAD NOT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE UNTIL PAST TEN O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY BEWILDERED BY THE DISCOVERY WHAT COULD HER DEAR GERARD HAVE BEEN DOING OUT IN THE DARK BY HIMSELF
5022-29405-0011_7505-258964-0051 OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC

5022-29405-0026_40-121026-0021 I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ON THE ANCIENT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
5022-29405-0027_103-1241-0016 HE STARED AT ME IN MOMENTARY PERPLEXITY AND SUDDENLY RECOVERING HIMSELF ASKED ME TO WALK IN ARE YOU THE YOUNG MASTER SIR AH YES YES I THOUGHT SO MY GIRL CRISTY SAID SHE SAW THE YOUNG MASTER LAST NIGHT THANK YOU KINDLY SIR I'M PRETTY WELL
5022-29405-0028_7859-102519-0045 MY MEALS DON'T SHOW ON ME YOU WILL EXCUSE MY RECEIVING YOU IN THE KITCHEN SIR IT'S THE BEST ROOM WE HAVE DID CRISTY TELL YOU HOW BADLY WE ARE OFF HERE FOR REPAIRS YOU BEING OUR LANDLORD WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP US WE ARE FALLING TO PIECES AS IT WERE
5022-29405-0029_5390-24512-0025 ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
5022-29405-0030_426-122822-0005 IN A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR WAS OPENED FROM WITHOUT A BROWN DOG OF THE COMPANIONABLE RETRIEVER BREED RAN IN AND FAWNED UPON OLD TOLLER CRISTEL FOLLOWED FROM THE KITCHEN GARDEN WITH A BASKET OF VEGETABLES ON HER ARM
5022-29405-0031_3242-67168-0036 I NOW SAW IN THEIR FULL BEAUTY THE LUSTER OF HER BROWN EYES THE WARM ROSINESS OF HER DARK COMPLEXION THE DELIGHTFUL VIVACITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH WAS THE CROWNING CHARM OF HER FACE SHE PAUSED CONFUSEDLY IN THE DOORWAY
5022-29405-0032_201-122255-0020 AND TRIED TO RESIST ME WHEN I INSISTED ON RELIEVING HER OF THE BASKET MISTER GERARD SHE PROTESTED
5022-29405-0033_2817-142380-0003 MY ANSWER WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE ASSUMED THE FORM OF A FOOLISH COMPLIMENT IF HER FATHER HAD NOT SPARED HER THAT INFLICTION
5022-29405-0034_831-130739-0017 HE SAYS ALL RIGHT AND HE DOES NOTHING THERE'S FIRST AS I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THE TRULY DREADFUL STATE OF THE DRAINS I TRIED TO STOP HIM BY PROMISING TO SPEAK TO THE BAILIFF MYSELF ON HEARING THIS GOOD NEWS MISTER TOLLER'S GRATITUDE BECAME UNGOVERNABLE
5022-29405-0035_2436-2476-0003 HE WAS MORE EAGER THAN EVER AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN EVER IN RETURNING TO THE REPAIRS AND THEN SIR THERE'S THE OVEN THEY DO CALL BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE IT'S A BURNT STAFF AT ONE TIME AND A CLAMMY STAFF AT ANOTHER
5022-29405-0036_248-130652-0009 HIS DAUGHTER INTERFERED AND STOPPED HIM AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY OFFERING HIS ARM TO CONDUCT ME IN STATE ACROSS THE KITCHEN CRISTEL HAD JUST PUT HER PRETTY BROWN HAND OVER HIS MOUTH AND SAID OH FATHER DO PRAY BE QUIET
5022-29405-0037_7178-34644-0049 WHEN WE WERE ALL THREE DISTURBED BY ANOTHER INTERRUPTION A SECOND DOOR COMMUNICATING AS I CONCLUDED FROM ITS POSITION WITH THE NEW COTTAGE WAS SUDDENLY OPENED IN THE INSTANT BEFORE THE PERSON BEHIND IT APPEARED THE DOG LOOKED THAT WAY
5022-29405-0040_587-54108-0050 HIS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS TRIUMPHED IN THE CLEAR SEARCHING LIGHT I NOW PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WERE OF THAT DEEPLY DARK BLUE WHICH IS COMMONLY AND FALSELY DESCRIBED AS RESEMBLING THE COLOR OF THE VIOLET TO MY THINKING THEY WERE SO ENTIRELY BEAUTIFUL
5022-29405-0043_8098-275181-0005 AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
5022-29411-0000_2391-145015-0094 MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
5022-29411-0001_4830-25898-0026 STILL WHILE CRISTEL'S ENTREATIES AND CRISTEL'S INFLUENCE HAD FAILED TO SHAKE ME GLOODY'S STRANGE LANGUAGE AND GLOODY'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT HAD TROUBLED MY MIND I FELT VAGUELY UNEASY IRRITATED BY MY OWN DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
5022-29411-0007_6415-100596-0025 WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO MY LORD'S DAUGHTER TO MY MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS OR TO MY VISITS AT THE MILL I WAS SECRETLY ANNOYED FEELING THAT MY STEPMOTHER'S SINGULAR INDIFFERENCE TO DOMESTIC INTERESTS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
5022-29411-0009_5339-14134-0067 I SAW MISSUS ROYLAKE READING A BOOK IN SAD COLORED BINDING SHE WAS YAWNING OVER IT FEARFULLY WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN INSTANTLY HANDED TO ME A SECOND AND SIMILAR VOLUME
5022-29411-0011_39-121916-0019 WHICH WAY DID I TURN MY STEPS MEN WILL WONDER WHAT POSSESSED ME WOMEN WILL THINK IT A PROCEEDING THAT DID ME CREDIT I TOOK THE FAMILIAR ROAD WHICH LED TO THE GLOOMY WOOD AND THE GUILTY RIVER THE LONGING IN ME TO SEE CRISTEL AGAIN WAS MORE THAN I COULD RESIST
5022-29411-0013_6437-66172-0035 BEHOLD THE MOCK REPUBLICAN KNOWN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AS LADY RACHEL SHE HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO ME BUT FOR HER PETTICOATS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD MET WITH A JOLLY YOUNG MAN
5022-29411-0015_6385-34655-0030 WHEN WE HAD LEFT EACH OTHER I THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY WHO WAS LADY RACHEL'S HUSBAND HE WAS A PERFECT STRANGER BUT I PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE AND FELT THAT I TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SEA
5022-29411-0019_8419-293469-0024 I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM YOU MARK MY WORDS I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM THAT OLD TOLLER THE MOST EXASPERATING OF MEN JUDGED BY A QUICK TEMPER HAD IRRITATED MY FRIEND INTO SPEAKING RASHLY WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS I FELT SOME ANXIETY
5022-29411-0020_2989-138028-0044 ABOUT CRISTEL AFTER LOOKING ROUND THE KITCHEN AGAIN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS SITTING FORLORN IN HER BEDROOM CRYING HER FATHER TOLD ME I WENT OUT FOR A WALK BY THE RIVER AND I SAT DOWN AND BEING SUNDAY I FELL ASLEEP WHEN I WOKE AND GOT HOME AGAIN JUST NOW THAT
5022-29411-0022_1970-26100-0018 BUT MISTER TOLLER I OBJECTED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO DISTRESS HER HAS SHE NOT TOLD YOU WHAT IT IS NOT SHE OBSTINATE ABOUT IT LEAVES ME TO GUESS IT'S CLEAR TO MY MIND MISTER GERARD THAT SOMEBODY HAS GOT AT HER IN MY ABSENCE
5022-29411-0024_6454-107462-0013 BUT YOU MEAN TO TRY YES I MEAN TO TRY HE ANSWERED ME WITH LITTLE OF THE ENERGY WHICH GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED HIM PERHAPS HE WAS FATIGUED OR PERHAPS HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF I OFFERED A SUGGESTION WHEN WE ARE
5022-29411-0025_1970-26100-0019 IN WANT OF HELP I SAID WE SOMETIMES FIND IT NEARER THAN WE HAD VENTURED TO EXPECT AT OUR OWN DOORS THE ANCIENT MILLER ROSE AT THAT HINT LIKE A FISH AT A FLY GLOODY HE CRIED FIND HIM AT ONCE MISTER TOLLER
5022-29411-0026_1447-130552-0016 I'VE GOT BURDENS ON MY MIND HE EXPLAINED OR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT TOO HAVING DONE JUSTICE TO HIS OWN ABILITIES HE BUSTLED OUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN A STATE OF BREATHLESS TRIUMPH GLOODY HAS SEEN THE PERSON HE ANNOUNCED AND
5022-29411-0029_89-219-0032 THE HAT I HAD SEEN ON THE HEAD OF THAT HATEFUL WOMAN WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED FOR A MAN SLY OLD TOLLER LEAVING GLOODY UNNOTICED AND KEEPING HIS EYE ON ME SAW THE SIGNS OF CONVICTION IN MY FACE AND SAID WITH HIS CUSTOMARY AUDACITY
5022-29411-0030_2416-152137-0032 WHO IS SHE I FOLLOWED AT MY HUMBLE DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT WHEN INQUISITIVE PEOPLE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IN PLAIN ENGLISH I DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRANGER WEARING THE GREEN HAT
5022-29411-0031_39-121914-0019 BUT I WAS NATURALLY DESIROUS OF DISCOVERING NEXT WHAT LADY RACHEL HAD SAID AND I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH CRISTEL HER FAR SEEING FATHER MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE PERCEIVED A CHANCE OF LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION
5022-29411-0033_1246-124548-0010 OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
5022-29411-0034_1743-142914-0018 AND SHOULD REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH PLEASURE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ILL CRISTEL WAS ALL I COULD FIND TO SAY UNDER THE DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THROUGH A DOOR AND HAVING A FATHER LISTENING AT MY SIDE OH NO MISTER GERARD NOT ILL
5022-29411-0035_5192-19396-0028 PRAY BE KINDER TO ME THAN EVER PRAY LET ME BE I SAID I WOULD RETURN ON THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SORE HEART OLD TOLLER HIGHLY APPROVED OF MY CONDUCT HE RUBBED HIS FLESHLESS HANDS AND WHISPERED
5022-29411-0038_1723-141149-0016 I FAILED TO SEE IT MYSELF IN THAT LIGHT IT STRUCK ME AS I WALKED HOME THAT CRISTEL MIGHT HAVE MADE MANY A WORSE FRIEND THAN THE RETIRED PRIZE FIGHTER A CHANGE IN MY MANNER WAS OF COURSE REMARKED BY MISSUS ROYLAKE'S READY OBSERVATION
5022-29411-0039_1624-168623-0049 I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
5022-29411-0042_2159-179157-0026 DERIVES A SPLENDOR NOT ITS OWN FROM FAVOURING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADE OUR GLOOMY TREES AND OUR REPELLENT RIVER PRESENTED AN ASPECT SUPERBLY TRANSFIGURED UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE TOWERING CLOUDS THE FANTASTIC WREATHS OF THE MIST
5022-29411-0043_6272-70168-0012 AND THE LURID REDDENING OF THE SUN AS IT STOOPED TO ITS SETTING LOVELY INTERFUSIONS OF SOBERED COLOR RESTED FADED RETURNED AGAIN ON THE UPPER LEAVES OF THE FOLIAGE AS THEY LIGHTLY MOVED THE MIST ROLLING CAPRICIOUSLY OVER THE WATERS
5022-29411-0044_7059-77897-0023 WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
5022-29411-0045_1841-150351-0032 DAYS HAPPY DAYS THAT WERE PAST REVIVED AGAIN I WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH MY MOTHER AMONG THE SCENES THAT WERE ROUND ME AND LEARNT FROM HER TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH WITH A HEART THAT FELT IT
5022-29411-0046_6925-80680-0053 WE WERE TRACING OUR WAY ALONG OUR FAVORITE WOODLAND PATH AND WE FOUND A COMPANION OF TENDER YEARS HIDING FROM US SHE SHOWED HERSELF BLUSHING HESITATING OFFERING A NOSEGAY OF WILD FLOWERS MY MOTHER WHISPERED TO ME
5022-29411-0048_1069-133699-0021 A VISIBLE HAND TOUCHED MY ARM AS I TURNED SUDDENLY A LIVING BREATH PLAYED ON MY FACE THE CHILD HAD FADED INTO A VANISHING SHADE THE PERFECTED WOMAN WHO HAD GROWN FROM HER HAD STOLEN ON ME UNAWARES AND WAS ASKING ME TO PARDON HER
5022-29411-0049_3374-298032-0024 MISTER GERARD YOU WERE LOST IN YOUR THOUGHTS I SPOKE AND YOU NEVER HEARD ME I LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE WAS THIS THE DEAR CRISTEL SO WELL KNOWN TO ME OR WAS IT A MOCKERY OF HER THAT HAD TAKEN HER PLACE
5022-29411-0051_6454-107462-0024 THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
5022-29411-0053_4160-11549-0031 I KNOW THAT SHE HAS VISITED YOU AND SPOKEN TO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS SAID I CAN GUESS
5022-29411-0054_7367-86737-0018 HER MANNER HAD BECOME QUIETER HER FACE WAS MORE COMPOSED HER EXPRESSION ALMOST RECOVERED ITS NATURAL CHARM WHILE SHE SPOKE OF LADY RACHEL I WAS STUPEFIED TRY SIR TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE IT SHE RESUMED GENTLY
5022-29411-0057_2159-179157-0009 AND FELT I DON'T DOUBT IT I HAD INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE THAN THIS BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF GLOODY'S MYSTERIOUS PREVARICATION AND OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS LED ME I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY HOW
5022-29411-0058_201-127786-0006 INTO ASSOCIATING CRISTEL'S AGITATION WITH SOMETHING WHICH THIS MAN MIGHT HAVE SAID TO HER I WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING THE QUESTION WHEN SHE HELD UP HER HAND AND SAID HUSH THE WIND WAS BLOWING TOWARDS US FROM THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED
5022-29411-0060_8468-295198-0013 CRISTEL COUNTED THE STROKES SEVEN SHE SAID ARE YOU DETERMINED TO KEEP YOUR ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD REPEATED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE AND WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COLOR TO PALENESS THE STRANGE QUESTION PUT TO ME BY GLOODY
5022-29411-0061_1098-133695-0029 IN HIS CASE I HAD FAILED TO TRACE THE MOTIVE I TRIED TO DISCOVER IT NOW TELL ME WHY I OUGHT TO BREAK MY ENGAGEMENT I SAID REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU AT THE SPRING SHE ANSWERED
5022-29411-0062_6000-55211-0014 YOU ARE DECEIVED BY A FALSE FRIEND WHO LIES TO YOU AND HATES YOU THE MAN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF TURNED THE CORNER OF THE NEW COTTAGE
5022-29411-0064_1624-168623-0038 I WAS LEFT TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS OLDER
5022-29411-0065_4481-17499-0021 THE FEAR OF APPEARING TO BE AFRAID AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE MADE MY EXCUSES TO MY HOST OF THE EVENING HOW WOULD MY MORAL COURAGE HAVE ANSWERED HIM IF HE HAD ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION USELESS TO SPECULATE ON IT HAD I POSSESSED THE WISDOM OF MIDDLE LIFE
5022-29411-0068_2196-170379-0020 HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
5022-29411-0069_1553-140047-0015 WILL YOU INQUIRE HE SAID IF MISS CRISTEL IS READY I WENT IN OLD TOLLER WAS IN THE KITCHEN SMOKING HIS PIPE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ENJOY IT WHAT'S COME TO MY GIRL HE ASKED THE MOMENT HE SAW ME
5022-29411-0070_6078-54007-0012 TO DAY SHE'S IN HER ROOM PRAYING THE WARNINGS WHICH I HAD NEGLECTED ROSE IN JUDGMENT AGAINST ME I WAS SILENT I WAS AWED BEFORE I RECOVERED MYSELF CRISTEL ENTERED THE KITCHEN HER FATHER WHISPERED
5049-25947-0000_909-131045-0025 THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
5049-25947-0002_3982-182255-0032 NOR EVEN A COLLECTION OF HOUSES IT IS THE MEETING PLACE OF TWO TRAILS WHICH JOIN AT THE APEX OF A V THREE MILES FROM THE SEAPORT TOWN OF SIBONEY AND CONTINUE MERGED IN A SINGLE TRAIL TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0003_8063-274112-0029 GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0005_3664-178355-0024 AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHEN HE FOUND HIM THAT NIGHT NO ONE SLEPT FOR UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TROOPS WERE STILL BEING DISEMBARKED IN THE SURF AND TWO SHIPS OF WAR HAD THEIR SEARCHLIGHTS TURNED ON THE LANDING PLACE
5049-25947-0006_8629-261140-0025 LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
5049-25947-0012_1355-39947-0051 THE ROUGH RIDERS LEFT CAMP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS THEY WERE DISMOUNTED AND CARRIED THEIR BLANKET ROLLS HAVERSACKS AMMUNITION AND CARBINES
5049-25947-0014_5688-15787-0018 THERE WAS A VALLEY BETWEEN US AND THE BUSHES WERE SO THICK ON BOTH SIDES OF OUR TRAIL
5049-25947-0018_3168-173565-0036 WE ADVANCED TALKING IN THAT FASHION AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AND CONGRATULATING OURSELVES IN BEING SHUT OF THE TRANSPORT AND ON BREATHING FINE MOUNTAIN AIR AGAIN
5049-25947-0020_5652-39938-0034 THERE WAS ON ONE SIDE OF IT A STOUT BARBED WIRE FENCE OF FIVE STRANDS BY SOME FORTUNATE ACCIDENT THIS FENCE HAD BEEN CUT JUST WHERE THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN HALTED ON THE LEFT OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0022_3242-8112-0018 THERE WAS NOT A FOOT OF FREE GROUND THE BUSHES SEEMED ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE AS INDEED THEY WERE LATER FOUND TO BE WHEN WE HALTED THE MEN SAT
5049-25947-0026_39-121916-0029 F AND E TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN SKIRMISH LINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FENCE WOOD HAD DISCOVERED THE ENEMY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM AND SO FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED HE HAD TIME
5049-25947-0027_7302-86814-0022 ACTING ON A FALSE ALARM AND THAT THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS AHEAD OF US I GUESSED IT WAS CAPRON'S MEN FIRING AT RANDOM TO DISCLOSE THE ENEMY'S POSITION I RAN AFTER G TROOP UNDER CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND FOUND
5049-25947-0028_211-122425-0036 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE THICKET AT ONE MOMENT THE UNDERBRUSH SEEMED SWARMING WITH OUR MEN AND THE NEXT EXCEPT THAT YOU HEARD THE TWIGS BREAKING AND HEAVY BREATHING OR A CRASH AS A VINE PULLED SOME ONE DOWN
5049-25947-0029_87-121553-0089 THROUGH THE TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THAT FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH MEN WERE FALLING ALL AROUND US THE SPANIARDS ON THE RIDGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT MANY OF US SAW BUT THE FIRE AGAINST US WAS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTY YARDS AWAY
5049-25947-0032_587-54108-0024 LATER WE EXAMINED THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE TRAIL WHICH CAPRON HELD AND THE POSITION OF G TROOP AND THEY WERE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER
5049-25947-0033_7800-283492-0023 CAPRON COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE FIRED INTO US AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE HAD TURNED DIRECTLY AROUND IN HIS TRACKS AND AIMED UP THE VERY TRAIL HE HAD JUST DESCENDED
5049-25947-0035_4195-17507-0046 THE ENEMY'S FIRE WAS SO CLOSE THAT THE MEN COULD NOT HEAR THE WORD OF COMMAND AND CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND LIEUTENANT GREENWAY UNABLE TO GET THEIR ATTENTION RAN AMONG THEM
5049-25947-0036_8014-112602-0012 LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
5049-25947-0037_6064-56168-0009 KANE WAS SMILING WITH THE CHARMING CONTENT OF A PERFECTLY HAPPY MAN WHEN CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN TOLD HIM HIS MEN WERE NOT NEEDED AND TO REJOIN HIS TROOP HE LED HIS DETAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE HILL ON WHICH WE LAY
5049-25947-0040_4195-17507-0034 IT HAD BEEN ORDERED TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN AND WHILE ADVANCING AND FIRING ON THE RIDGE CAPTAIN JENKINS SENT
5049-25947-0042_311-124404-0083 BUT HE CONTINUED WAVING IT UNTIL THE TENTH CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ANSWERED AND THE TWO COLUMNS WERE CONNECTED BY A SKIRMISH LINE COMPOSED OF K TROOP AND A UNDER CAPTAIN BUCKY O'NEILL
5049-25947-0045_2989-138028-0026 WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
5049-25947-0046_6209-34599-0006 HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
5049-25947-0049_7794-295955-0030 THE FIRE DISCIPLINE WAS EXCELLENT THE PROPHETS OF EVIL OF THE TAMPA BAY HOTEL HAD FORETOLD THAT THE COWBOYS WOULD SHOOT AS THEY CHOSE AND IN THE FIELD WOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR OFFICERS
5049-25947-0052_2384-152900-0026 IT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A DRESSING STATION AND THE WOUNDED OF G TROOP WERE LEFT THERE IN THE CARE OF THE HOSPITAL STEWARDS A TALL GAUNT YOUNG MAN WITH A CROSS ON HIS ARM WAS JUST COMING BACK UP THE TRAIL HIS HEAD WAS BENT
5049-25947-0053_6454-107462-0002 I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
5049-25947-0057_3857-180923-0005 THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
5049-25947-0058_2159-179156-0014 HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
5049-25947-0059_8580-287363-0015 FOR THE WOUNDED LYING ALONG ITS LENGTH WERE AS STILL AS THE DEAD BESIDE THEM THE NOISE OF THE LOOSE STONES ROLLING UNDER MY FEET BROUGHT A HOSPITAL STEWARD OUT OF THE BRUSH AND HE CALLED AFTER ME
5049-25947-0060_3214-167602-0009 LIEUTENANT THOMAS IS BADLY WOUNDED IN HERE AND WE CAN'T MOVE HIM
5049-25947-0061_4813-248638-0029 SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
5049-25947-0063_7264-92316-0014 IT GAVE ONE A THRILL OF AWE AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THESE COWBOY SURGEONS WITH A STICK THAT ONE WOULD USE TO LIGHT A PIPE AND WITH THE GAUDY KERCHIEFS THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THEIR NECKS
5049-25947-0071_5104-33406-0018 A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
5049-25947-0072_4481-17499-0039 SCRIBBLED IN IT IN PENCIL
5049-25947-0074_3486-166424-0032 WAS WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE FARTHEST POINT
5049-25947-0075_1963-142393-0042 AND I WAS RUNNING FORWARD FEELING CONFIDENT THAT I MUST BE CLOSE ON OUR MEN WHEN I SAW THE BODY OF A SERGEANT BLOCKING THE TRAIL AND STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ACROSS IT
5049-25947-0076_1355-39947-0001 IT WAS APPARENTLY THE BODY OF THE FIRST MAN KILLED AFTER DEATH THE BODIES OF SOME MEN SEEM TO SHRINK ALMOST INSTANTLY WITHIN THEMSELVES THEY BECOME LIMP AND SHAPELESS
5049-25947-0077_1246-124548-0009 WITH HIS REGIMENT BEHIND HIM AND FACING THE ENEMIES OF HIS COUNTRY THE LINE AT THIS TIME WAS DIVIDED BY THE TRAIL INTO TWO WINGS THE RIGHT WING COMPOSED OF K AND A TROOPS WAS ADVANCING THROUGH THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0079_4640-19189-0020 AND AT THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN LATER WHEN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE ARM WAS PROMOTED TO BE CAPTAIN OF L TROOP OR AS IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED CAPRON'S TROOP HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE LINE AS UNCONCERNEDLY
5049-25947-0081_6563-285357-0014 BYRNE WAS THE ONLY MAN I NOTICED WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THE FIGHT AS IN ANY WAY HUMOROUS
5049-25947-0083_8014-280382-0008 AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN UNDER FIRE NOR HAD ONE MAN IN THE REGIMENT EVER FIRED A KRAG JORGENSEN CARBINE UNTIL HE FIRED IT AT A SPANIARD
5049-25947-0085_8095-274346-0032 AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
5049-25947-0088_1455-134435-0057 THEIR LIMBS UNUSED TO SUCH EXERTION AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF CRAMPED IDLENESS ON THE TROOP SHIP TREMBLED WITH WEAKNESS AND THE SUN BLINDED
5049-25947-0089_7113-86041-0090 BUT TIME AFTER TIME THEY ROSE AND STAGGERED FORWARD THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS
5049-25947-0090_2691-156750-0015 AND PASSING THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF CONVULSIONS HE NEVERTHELESS IN HIS BRIEF MOMENTS OF COMPARATIVE PEACE BORE HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST CALM
5049-25947-0091_374-180298-0064 A SOLDIER TO DUTY THAT HE CONTINUED WRITING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE FIGHT
5049-25947-0093_6476-57446-0078 FOR AGUARDIENTE AND WAS NOW OCCUPIED IN FORCE BY THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE FAR LEFT WAS MOVING UP HIS MEN WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THIS HOUSE ON THE FLANK
5049-25947-0099_6147-34605-0023 AND RAN FOR THE COVER THEY WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE LIKE MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN AND FELL PANTING ON THEIR FACES WHILE THE WESTERN TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS SLIPPED AND WRIGGLED THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE INDIANS
5049-25947-0101_125-121124-0070 SOME OF THE ESCAPES WERE LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS THE MAN ON MY RIGHT CHAMPNEYS MARSHALL OF WASHINGTON HAD ONE BULLET PASS THROUGH HIS SLEEVE AND ANOTHER PASS THROUGH HIS SHIRT WHERE IT WAS PULLED CLOSE TO HIS SPINE
5049-25947-0102_1867-154071-0031 AND ROOSEVELT WAS SO CLOSE TO ONE BULLET WHEN IT STRUCK A TREE THAT IT FILLED HIS EYES AND EARS WITH TINY SPLINTERS MAJOR BRODIE AND LIEUTENANT THOMAS WERE BOTH WOUNDED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0103_2952-410-0013 AT SIBONEY ROWLAND SAT STILL FOR A SHORT TIME
5049-25947-0104_7148-7763-0031 WITH THE REST OF THE WOUNDED BUT TWO DAYS LATER HE APPEARED IN CAMP
5049-25947-0105_4481-17498-0048 A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY CARRYING HIS CARBINE CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL WOOD SAID I WAS ROWLAND ANSWERED SHEEPISHLY
5049-25947-0107_4195-186238-0009 IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ENEMY EARLY IN THE FIGHT I CAME UPON CHURCH ATTENDING TO A YOUNG COWBOY WHO WAS SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
5049-25947-0109_445-123857-0013 CAN YOU STAND BEING CARRIED DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CARRY ME THE TROOPER ASKED YES WELL EXCLAIMED THE BOY ADMIRINGLY YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
5049-25947-0110_4640-19189-0018 GAVE HIM HIS CHOICE OF RIDING DOWN TO SIBONEY
5049-25947-0112_3486-166424-0064 YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
5049-25947-0116_1867-148436-0010 WHILE TO THE ENEMY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE FORCE WAS BUT THE SKIRMISH LINE IN ADVANCE OF A REGIMENT THE SPANIARDS NATURALLY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THIN LINE WHICH SUDDENLY BROKE OUT OF THE BUSHES
5049-25947-0118_4397-15668-0033 AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
5049-25947-0119_7511-102419-0022 IT WAS WHAT FIRST TOLD HALF THE MEN WHERE THE OTHER HALF WERE AND IT MADE EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN FEEL BETTER AS WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A BLUFF THE FIRST CHEER WAS WAVERING
5049-25947-0120_831-130746-0036 WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
5049-25947-0121_1737-142397-0035 WHERE HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS OF SANTIAGO ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IF THOSE AMERICANS FOUGHT WELL WELL HE REPLIED
5049-25947-0123_3168-173564-0024 AS IT WAS OWING TO COLONEL WOOD'S CHARGE WHICH TOOK THE SPANIARDS IN FLANK THAT GENERAL WHEELER AND GENERAL YOUNG WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE
5049-25947-0124_322-124146-0009 OVER FOUR TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER INTRENCHED BEHIND RIFLE PITS AND BUSHES IN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN SPITE OF THE SMOKELESS POWDER USED BY THE SPANIARDS
5049-25947-0126_3526-176653-0033 THE EAGER SPIRIT IN WHICH THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS BEST DESCRIBED IN THE SPANISH SOLDIER'S ANSWER TO THE INQUIRING CIVILIAN THEY TRIED TO CATCH US WITH THEIR HANDS
5104-33406-0001_5561-39621-0031 VOICES WERE LOUD ARMS WERE SWINGING IT WAS AN UNJUST DECISION SOME ONE CRIED ERIC KILLED THE MEN IN FAIR FIGHT THE JUDGES OUTLAWED HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID HIS FOE THORGEST HAS MANY RICH AND POWERFUL MEN TO BACK HIM
5104-33406-0004_460-172359-0025 HIS STORY WOULD MAKE A FINE SONG ONE SAID AS STRONG AND AS BRAVE AND AS RED AS THOR ALWAYS IN A QUARREL A MAN OF MANY PLACES NORWAY THE NORTH OF ICELAND THE WEST OF ICELAND

5104-33406-0029_7780-274562-0044 IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER

5163-39921-0002_328-129766-0097 BUT SHE WAS A CAPABLE GIRL AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HER OWN ABILITY TO GET AND KEEP THE SCHOOL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY AT MISTER BAXTER VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNING THE CHILDREN SEEM BRIGHT AND TEACHABLE
5163-39921-0005_5463-39173-0010 NOT OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ANY PERSONAL OBJECTION TO YOU BUT HE IS SET AGAINST FEMALE TEACHERS AND WHEN A CROPPER IS SET THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH CAN CHANGE HIM HE SAYS FEMALE TEACHERS CAN'T KEEP ORDER
5163-39921-0008_6531-61334-0025 BUT MAYBE THEY'LL BEHAVE ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL MISTER BAXTER PRIVATELY HAD NO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BUT ESTHER HOPED FOR THE BEST SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT MISTER CROPPER WOULD CARRY HIS PREJUDICES INTO A PERSONAL APPLICATION
5163-39921-0010_2764-36617-0038 HOPED SHE WAS GETTING ON WELL AND SAID HE HAD TWO YOUNG RASCALS OF HIS OWN TO SEND SOON ESTHER FELT RELIEVED SHE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAXTER HAD EXAGGERATED MATTERS A LITTLE THAT PLUM TREE OF MISSUS CHARLEY'S IS LOADED WITH FRUIT AGAIN THIS YEAR

5163-39921-0018_2289-152257-0003 IT'S THE FINEST ONE IN MAITLAND BUT MISSUS CHARLEY NEVER GETS A PLUM FROM IT
5163-39921-0021_5339-14133-0049 I DON'T THINK MISTER CROPPER WOULD STEAL PROTESTED ESTHER WELL HE DOESN'T CONSIDER IT STEALING YOU KNOW HE CLAIMS THE LAND AND SAYS THE PLUMS ARE HIS
5163-39921-0022_4014-186179-0014 I DON'T DOUBT THAT HE IS QUITE CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THEY ARE AND HE DOES HATE MISSUS CHARLEY I'D GIVE CONSIDERABLE TO SEE THE OLD SINNER FAIRLY CAUGHT BUT HE IS TOO DEEP
5163-39921-0024_118-121721-0010 DURING THAT TIME THE CROPPER BOYS HAD COME TO SCHOOL AT FIRST ESTHER HAD BEEN INCLINED TO LIKE THEM THEY WERE HANDSOME LADS WITH THE SAME SMOOTH WAY THAT CHARACTERIZED THEIR FATHER AND SEEMED BRIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
5163-39921-0025_8425-292520-0027 FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL AND ESTHER FELT DECIDEDLY RELIEVED BUT BEFORE LONG A SUBTLE SPIRIT OF INSUBORDINATION BEGAN TO MAKE ITSELF FELT IN THE SCHOOL ESTHER FOUND HERSELF POWERLESS TO COPE WITH IT
5163-39921-0026_60-121082-0092 THE CROPPERS NEVER OPENLY DEFIED HER BUT THEY DID PRECISELY AS THEY PLEASED THE OTHER PUPILS THOUGHT THEMSELVES AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME POOR ESTHER HAD COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF HER LITTLE KINGDOM
5163-39921-0027_6529-62554-0041 SOME COMPLAINTS WERE HEARD AMONG THE RATEPAYERS AND EVEN MISTER BAXTER LOOKED DUBIOUS SHE KNEW THAT UNLESS SHE COULD REGAIN HER AUTHORITY SHE WOULD BE REQUESTED TO HAND IN HER RESIGNATION
5163-39921-0028_4137-11701-0049 BUT SHE WAS BAFFLED BY THE ELUSIVE SYSTEM OF DEFIANCE WHICH THE CROPPER BOYS HAD ORGANIZED ONE DAY SHE RESOLVED TO GO TO MISTER CROPPER HIMSELF AND APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE IF HE HAD ANY
5163-39921-0032_1183-124566-0000 AND AFTER SCHOOL WENT UP TO ISAAC CROPPER'S HOUSE THAT GENTLEMAN HIMSELF CAME IN FROM THE HARVEST FIELD LOOKING AS COURTLY AS USUAL EVEN IN HIS ROUGH WORKING CLOTHES HE SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY TOLD HER HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER
5163-39921-0037_3440-171006-0000 NOT THAT I DISAPPROVE OF YOU PERSONALLY FAR FROM IT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I HAVE HEARD MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ORDER IN SCHOOL AT PRESENT I HAD NO TROUBLE UNTIL YOUR BOYS CAME
5163-39921-0041_2518-154825-0012 BUT HERE AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID WE NEED A FIRM HAND AT THE HELM BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING YET MISS MAXWELL YOU NEED SOME REFRESHMENT AFTER YOUR LONG WALK MISSUS CROPPER WILL BRING YOU IN SOMETHING NO THANK YOU SAID POOR ESTHER
5163-39921-0044_4195-17507-0004 BUT THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP AND EVIDENTLY DESERTED SO SHE RAMBLED PAST IT TO THE BACK FIELDS PASSING THROUGH A GROVE OF MAPLES SHE CAME OUT AMONG LEAFY YOUNG SAPLINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST BEYOND HER WITH ITS LADEN BOUGHS HANGING OVER THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0045_2911-7601-0039 WAS THE FAMOUS PLUM TREE ESTHER LOOKED AT IT FOR A MOMENT THEN AN ODD SMILE GLEAMED OVER HER FACE AND SHE LIFTED HER KODAK MONDAY EVENING ESTHER CALLED ON MISTER CROPPER AGAIN
5163-39921-0047_2007-149877-0013 I HAVE BROUGHT YOU UP A PROOF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT SHE ROSE AND PLACED THE PROOF ON THE TABLE BEFORE MISTER CROPPER THE PLUM TREE CAME OUT CLEARLY
5163-39921-0048_103-1240-0042 BOB AND ALF CROPPER WERE UP AMONG THE BOUGHS PICKING THE PLUMS ON THE GROUND BENEATH THEM STOOD THEIR FATHER WITH A BASKET OF FRUIT IN HIS HAND MISTER CROPPER LOOKED AT THE PROOF AND FROM IT TO ESTHER
5163-39921-0049_1098-133695-0021 HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR UNCONCERNED GLITTER BUT HIS VOICE WAS DEFIANT THE PLUMS ARE MINE BY RIGHT HE SAID PERHAPS SAID ESTHER CALMLY BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO NOT THINK SO

5192-19396-0000_405-130894-0027 THE FATES WHO CERTAINLY ALL FORE KNEW OF THESE AMOURS OF WIDOW WADMAN AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF MATTER AND MOTION AND WITH MORE COURTESY THAN THEY USUALLY DO THINGS OF THIS KIND ESTABLISHED SUCH A CHAIN OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS HANGING SO FAST TO ONE ANOTHER

5192-19396-0014_5322-7680-0015 THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN THE ATTACK WAS THIS THAT IN GOING UPON IT AS IN THE FIRST CASE WITH THE END OF HER FORE FINGER AGAINST THE END OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE SHE MIGHT HAVE TRAVELLED WITH IT ALONG THE LINES FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA HAD MY UNCLE TOBY'S LINES REACH'D SO FAR
5192-19396-0015_405-130895-0019 WITHOUT ANY EFFECT FOR AS THERE WAS NO ARTERIAL OR VITAL HEAT IN THE END OF THE TOBACCO PIPE IT COULD EXCITE NO SENTIMENT IT COULD NEITHER GIVE FIRE BY PULSATION OR RECEIVE IT BY SYMPATHY

5322-7680-0033_5561-41615-0013 AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TELLING VANYUSHA NOT ONLY THAT HE HAD GIVEN LUKASHKA THE HORSE BUT ALSO WHY HE HAD DONE IT AS WELL AS HIS NEW THEORY OF HAPPINESS VANYUSHA DID NOT APPROVE OF HIS THEORY AND ANNOUNCED THAT
5339-14133-0001_669-129074-0028 AND BELL ROBSON THOUGH NOT GETTING WORSE DID NOT MAKE ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS AMENDMENT
5339-14133-0003_4014-186183-0017 LIKE NANCY AND BORROWING THE POOR GIRL'S OWN WORDS SHE WOULD SAY SOFTLY TO HERSELF HE ONCE WAS HERE BUT ALL ALONG SHE BELIEVED IN HER HEART HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN TO HER THOUGH IT TOUCHED HER STRANGELY TO IMAGINE THE AGONIES OF FORSAKEN LOVE
5339-14133-0005_7794-295948-0025 AND TO SEE SYLVIA FOR THE TWO FOSTERS WERE PUNCTILIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THEIR SHOPMEN TEST ALL THEIR STATEMENTS INSISTING ON AN EXAMINATION OF THE STOCK AS IF HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE STRANGERS TO THE SHOP
5339-14133-0006_196-122152-0030 BY DEGREES BOTH HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE INTRODUCED TO DISTANT MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE DEALERS
5339-14133-0007_4830-25904-0001 BUT THIS IT WAS EVIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE SATISFIED THEIR MASTERS WHO WERE SCRUPULOUS IN INSISTING THAT WHATEVER ADVANTAGE THERE WAS SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE YOUNGER MEN WHEN PHILIP SAW SYLVIA SHE WAS ALWAYS QUIET AND GENTLE
5339-14133-0008_2002-139469-0060 PERHAPS MORE SILENT THAN SHE HAD BEEN A YEAR AGO AND SHE DID NOT ATTEND SO BRISKLY TO WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER SHE WAS RATHER THINNER AND PALER BUT WHATEVER CHANGE THERE WAS IN HER WAS ALWAYS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHILIP'S EYES
5339-14133-0010_6454-120342-0015 OF WHICH SHE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED WAS QUITE UNAWARE SHE LIKED HIM BETTER TOO THAN SHE HAD DONE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE BECAUSE HE DID NOT SHOW HER ANY OF THE EAGER ATTENTION WHICH TEASED HER THEN ALTHOUGH ITS MEANING WAS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD
5339-14133-0014_4788-294466-0024 AND YET THESE MUST BE REACHED BEFORE JUNE OR THE YEAR'S EXPEDITION WOULD BE OF LITTLE AVAIL EVERY BLACKSMITH'S SHOP RUNG WITH THE RHYTHMICAL CLANG OF BUSY HAMMERS BEATING OUT OLD IRON SUCH AS HORSESHOES NAILS OR STUBS INTO THE GREAT HARPOONS
5339-14133-0016_5789-57158-0030 STORES HAD TO BE PURCHASED BY THE WHALING MASTERS WARM CLOTHING OF ALL SORTS TO BE PROVIDED THESE WERE THE LARGER WHOLESALE ORDERS BUT MANY A MAN AND WOMAN TOO BROUGHT OUT THEIR SMALL HOARDS TO PURCHASE EXTRA COMFORTS OR PRECIOUS KEEPSAKES FOR SOME BELOVED ONE
5339-14133-0017_3699-47246-0032 IT WAS THE TIME OF THE GREAT HALF YEARLY TRAFFIC OF THE PLACE ANOTHER IMPETUS WAS GIVEN TO BUSINESS WHEN THE WHALERS RETURNED IN THE AUTUMN AND THE MEN WERE FLUSH OF MONEY AND FULL OF DELIGHT AT ONCE MORE SEEING THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FRIENDS
5339-14133-0018_625-132118-0003 THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
5339-14133-0023_89-218-0003 WHY WHAT'S UP SAID PHILIP SURPRISED AT WILLIAM'S UNUSUAL MANNER AND AT THE SAME TIME RATHER GRATIFIED TO FIND A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN FEELINGS ABOUT KINRAID COULSON'S FACE WAS PALE WITH ANGER
5339-14133-0026_6147-34605-0033 THIS FAULT OF HIS WAS ONE WITH WHICH THE TWO GRAVE SEDATE YOUNG MEN HAD NO SYMPATHY THEIR HEARTS WERE TRUE AND CONSTANT WHATEVER ELSE MIGHT BE THEIR FAILINGS AND IT IS NO NEW THING TO DAMN THE FAULTS WE HAVE NO MIND TO
5339-14133-0027_7367-86737-0008 HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
5339-14133-0028_5789-57195-0003 SYLVIA SAT IN THE HOUSE PLACE HER BACK TO THE LONG LOW WINDOW IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE LIGHT THE AFTERNOON HOUR AFFORDED FOR HER WORK A BASKET OF HER FATHER'S UNMENDED STOCKINGS WAS ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE BESIDE HER
5339-14133-0030_196-122150-0033 IT WAS REDD UP FOR THE AFTERNOON COVERED WITH A BLACK MASS OF COAL OVER WHICH THE EQUALLY BLACK KETTLE HUNG ON THE CROOK IN THE BACK KITCHEN DOLLY REID SYLVIA'S ASSISTANT DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE CHANTED A LUGUBRIOUS DITTY BEFITTING HER CONDITION AS A WIDOW
5339-14133-0031_730-358-0028 CHARLEY KINRAID AND THE STORY OF CRAZY NANCY HAD BEEN THE SUBJECTS FOR HER DREAMS FOR MANY A DAY AND MANY A NIGHT NOW HE STOOD THERE BRIGHT AND HANDSOME AS EVER WITH JUST THAT MUCH TIMIDITY IN HIS FACE THAT ANXIETY AS TO HIS WELCOME
5339-14133-0032_911-128684-0071 SHE DID NOT COME FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE WENT CRIMSON TO THE VERY ROOTS OF HER HAIR BUT THAT IN THE WANING LIGHT HE COULD NOT SEE AND SHE SHOOK SO THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD HARDLY STAND BUT THE TREMOR WAS NOT VISIBLE TO HIM
5339-14133-0033_6454-107462-0016 THE TONES THE LOOKS THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THOSE WORDS BUT ALL SHE SAID WAS I DIDN'T THINK TO SEE YO
5339-14133-0036_7226-86965-0024 AND SO DID HE AND WHEN THEY ROSE UP HE HAD FAST HOLD OF HER HAND AND HER FACE WAS TURNED AWAY HALF READY TO CRY
5339-14133-0039_2989-138028-0062 TILL I'D TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ME MORE BUT IF SHE'S A COLD HEART AND CANNOT CARE FOR A HONEST SAILOR WHY THEN I'D BEST GO BACK AT ONCE HE MADE FOR THE DOOR HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY SURE FROM SOME SIGN OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT IT TO HER WOMANLY PRIDE TO GIVE WAY
5339-14133-0040_8226-274371-0049 HE HAD NOT TAKEN TWO STEPS WHEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING
5339-14133-0043_3607-29116-0033 HAD GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND OBTAINING HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO TELL EITHER HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER AT PRESENT I HA SPENT MY MONEY PRETTY FREE HE SAID AND I'VE NE'ER A PENNY TO THE FORE
5339-14133-0044_5561-41615-0015 AND YO'R PARENTS MAY LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER FOR YO MY PRETTY
5339-14133-0046_5750-100289-0033 THERE'LL BE NO NEED O THAT MURMURED SYLVIA SHE WAS TOO DIZZY WITH HAPPINESS TO HAVE ATTENDED MUCH TO HIS DETAILS OF HIS WORLDLY PROSPECTS BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS TENDER WORDS OF LOVE HER EAGER HEART WAS READY TO LISTEN I DON'T KNOW
5339-14133-0047_322-124146-0033 AND THERE'S YON TALL FELLOW OF A COUSIN AS LOOKS BLACK AT ME
5339-14133-0051_5514-19193-0015 ROBSON LISTENED TO ALL HE SAID WITH APPROVING NODS AND WINKS TILL CHARLEY HAD TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HE HAD TO SAY AND THEN HE TURNED AND STRUCK HIS BROAD HORNY PALM INTO KINRAID'S AS IF CONCLUDING A BARGAIN
5339-14134-0001_6367-65536-0060 SEVERAL TIMES JEREMIAH CAME OUT OF THE PARLOUR IN WHICH HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS SITTING IN EXPECTANT SILENCE AND PASSING THROUGH THE SHOP LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE MARKET PLACE IN SEARCH OF THE OLD LAME WOMAN WHO WAS CHARITABLY EMPLOYED TO DELIVER LETTERS
5339-14134-0006_8324-286682-0030 IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
5339-14134-0010_5652-19215-0023 AND WAS PUBLICLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS EXCELLENT AND PHILANTHROPIC CHARACTER BUT THESE LETTERS WERE PROVOCATIVE OF ANXIETY ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MORNING'S POST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE WRITER'S FULL NAME AND VARIOUS PARTICULARS SHOWING HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF DICKINSON'S AFFAIRS
5339-14134-0011_4830-25904-0004 AFTER MUCH PERPLEXED CONSULTATION JOHN HAD HIT UPON THE PLAN OF SENDING HEPBURN TO LONDON TO MAKE SECRET INQUIRIES RESPECTING THE TRUE CHARACTER AND COMMERCIAL POSITION OF THE MAN WHOSE CREDITORS NOT A MONTH AGO THEY HAD ESTEEMED IT AN HONOUR TO BE
5339-14134-0012_3242-67168-0020 EVEN NOW JEREMIAH WAS ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE SO GOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD RECEIVED WOULD ALL PROVE A MISTAKE FOUNDED ON ERRONEOUS GROUNDS IF NOT A PURE INVENTION OF AN ENEMY
5339-14134-0013_2002-139469-0095 AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN BROUGHT PARTIALLY TO CONSENT TO THE SENDING OF HEPBURN BY HIS BROTHER'S PLEDGING HIMSELF THAT THE REAL NATURE OF PHILIP'S ERRAND SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE SAVE THEM THREE AS ALL THIS WAS BEING REVEALED TO PHILIP HE SAT APPARENTLY UNMOVED AND SIMPLY ATTENTIVE
5339-14134-0014_6272-70191-0032 IN FACT HE WAS GIVING ALL HIS MIND TO UNDERSTANDING THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE LEAVING HIS OWN FEELINGS IN THE BACKGROUND TILL HIS INTELLECT SHOULD HAVE DONE ITS WORK HE SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT HE DID SAY WAS TO THE POINT AND SATISFIED BOTH BROTHERS
5339-14134-0015_1737-142397-0038 JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
5339-14134-0016_3235-11599-0025 PHILIP HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING HIMSELF EMPLOYED ON A MISSION WHICH WOULD CALL OUT HIS POWERS AND YET NOT EXCEED THEM IN HIS OWN MIND HE FORESTALLED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS MASTERS AND WAS SILENTLY IN ADVANCE OF JOHN FOSTER'S PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS
5339-14134-0019_1970-28415-0015 THE LATTER WAS SILENT BROODING OVER THE CONFIDENCE WHICH PHILIP HAD APPARENTLY RECEIVED BUT WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM HE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE CULMINATING POINT OF PHILIP'S PROPOSED JOURNEY TO LONDON
5339-14134-0020_1553-140048-0016 THAT GREAT CITY OF LONDON WHICH FROM ITS VERY INACCESSIBILITY FIFTY YEARS AGO LOOMED SO MAGNIFICENT THROUGH THE MIST OF MEN'S IMAGINATIONS IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT PHILIP FELT EXULTANT AT THE MERE FACT OF GOING TO LONDON BUT THEN AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING SYLVIA
5339-14134-0021_5678-43301-0001 OF NOT SEEING HER FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT NAY HE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A MONTH FOR NO RASH HURRY WAS TO MAR HIS DELICATE NEGOTIATION GNAWED AT HIS HEART
5339-14134-0024_6818-68772-0003 TO LUNNON EXCLAIMED ALICE HESTER SAID NOTHING

5339-14134-0029_4195-186237-0007 PHILIP KNOWS SAID HESTER AND THEN SOMEHOW HER VOICE FAILED HER AND SHE STOPPED PHILIP PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS HALF UTTERED SENTENCE HE WAS EAGER TO TELL COULSON AS FAR AS HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS MASTER'S SECRET HOW MANY DRAWBACKS THERE WERE TO HIS PROPOSED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0031_7190-90542-0038 I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST

5339-14134-0037_3214-167607-0012 AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
5339-14134-0039_8975-270782-0075 HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
5339-14134-0043_4397-15666-0022 NAY SAID PHILIP I KNEW NOUGHT ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT IT'S NONE O MY DOING GOING FOR I'D LIEFER HA STAYED WHERE I AM YO'LL LIKE IT WHEN ONCE YO'RE THERE

5339-14134-0054_4195-186236-0019 GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
5339-14134-0055_8324-286681-0000 HER LIPS STILL WARM AND REDDENED BY HIS KISS WERE JUST PARTED IN A HAPPY SMILE WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING FOOTSTEP A FOOTSTEP QUITE FAMILIAR ENOUGH FOR HER TO RECOGNIZE IT AND WHICH WAS UNWELCOME NOW
5339-14134-0059_8630-305212-0041 THAT SHE WHOM HE LOVED HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND HE HAD NEGLECTED IT SO ANXIOUS TO BE EXCUSED AND FORGIVEN HE WENT ON WITH THE APOLOGY SHE CARED NOT TO HEAR IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN AFFAIRS LESS ENGROSSED WITH DEEP FEELING
5339-14134-0060_6476-57446-0003 SHE WOULD HAVE REPROACHED HIM IF ONLY IN JEST FOR HIS CARELESSNESS AS IT WAS SHE SCARCELY TOOK IN THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS
5339-14134-0062_27-123349-0036 ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON

5339-14134-0073_211-122442-0043 AT LENGTH HE RAISED HIS STIFFENED BODY AND STOOD UP DIZZY UP THE LITTLE WOODEN STAIRS HE WENT WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE TO THE SMALL SQUARE LANDING ALMOST FILLED UP WITH THE GREAT CHEST FOR OAT CAKE HE BREATHED HARD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF SYLVIA'S ROOM
5339-14134-0076_1737-146161-0011 AND GOD BLESS YO I'M SORRY I VEXED YO NO REPLY WITH A HEAVY HEAVY HEART HE CREAKED DOWN THE STAIRS FELT FOR HIS CAP AND LEFT THE HOUSE
5339-14134-0077_481-123720-0044 THE NEED FOR HIS DEPARTURE AND YET HE STOOD STILL FOR A LITTLE TIME LIKE ONE ENTRANCED AS IF HIS WILL HAD LOST ALL POWER TO COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THOSE TWO WORDS OF HERS WHICH TWO HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FAR BENEATH HIS ASPIRATIONS
5390-24512-0000_3526-176653-0048 FOR ALTHOUGH THE JEWISH FAMILY OF THE HERODS REIGNED OVER JUDEA THEY ONLY HELD THEIR THRONE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPEROR THIS THE JEWS COULD NOT ENDURE THEY LONGED TO BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION ONCE AGAIN
5390-24512-0001_7190-90542-0063 WHEN OUR MESSIAH COMES HE WILL BE A GREAT WARRIOR THEY SAID HE WILL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL OUR ENEMIES HE WILL MAKE JERUSALEM THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY
5390-24512-0002_5322-7678-0028 HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
5390-24512-0003_4362-15663-0072 THE SAVIOUR SOUGHT TO HEAL IT HE CALLED OUT THE FAITH AND GRATITUDE OF THE ROMAN CENTURION AND HIS ANSWER TO THE JEWISH LEADERS RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S
5390-24512-0004_2893-139310-0039 SHOWED THEM THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WHICH TO REGARD THE ROMAN RULE
5390-24512-0005_289-121665-0017 THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
5390-24512-0007_87-121553-0096 TO CRUCIFY JESUS OF NAZARETH AND TO FREE BARABBAS BUT IN CHOOSING THE REBEL BARABBAS
5390-24512-0009_2159-179156-0016 AND THE HISTORY OF THOSE YEARS IS ONE LONG LIST OF TERRIBLE RISINGS AND MASSACRES WHILE CITIES WERE RUINED VILLAGES WRAPPED IN FLAMES AND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERISHED WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0010_4788-294466-0011 YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0014_32-4137-0055 THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
5390-24512-0017_1447-130551-0019 HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0018_7511-102419-0046 AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0024_8425-287387-0029 WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
5390-24512-0026_311-124404-0059 AND THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW WERE CARRIED AWAY IN TRIUMPH INTO HEATHEN ROME ALAS FOR THE HOLY CITY OVER WHICH THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD STOOD AND WEPT FORTY YEARS BEFORE
5390-24512-0027_441-130108-0008 KNOWING THE SUFFERING THAT LAY BEFORE HER THESE JEWS ARE DANGEROUS WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR CITY OR TO BECOME A SEPARATE PEOPLE AGAIN AS A NATION THEY MUST CEASE TO EXIST
5390-24512-0030_8123-275193-0019 THE JEWS WERE NOW NO LONGER A NATION THEY HAD BECOME MERELY A BODY OF PEOPLE LED BY THEIR RABBIS OR TEACHERS OF THE LAW BUT THEY WERE STILL THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK
5390-24512-0031_7059-77900-0031 THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
5390-24512-0033_2843-152918-0028 SO ALL DAY LONG THEY STUDIED AND COPIED THE OLD HEBREW BIBLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE JEWISH SCRIBES HAD NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH TAKING THE WORD OF GOD JUST AS IT STOOD THEY HAD BEGUN EVEN IN OUR LORD'S DAY
5390-24512-0034_40-222-0026 THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
5390-24512-0035_5049-25947-0113 YET ALTHOUGH THEY HEEDED SO LITTLE THE TRUE MEANING OF GOD'S BOOK THEY GUARDED ITS WORDS MORE AND MORE CAREFULLY AND THE RULES FOR COPYING ANY PORTION OF THE HOLY BOOKS WERE STRICT INDEED MY SON AN OLD TEACHER WOULD SAY TO HIS PUPIL
5390-24512-0039_7059-88364-0033 BEFORE WRITING ANY OF THE NAMES OF GOD YOU MUST WASH YOUR PEN BEFORE WRITING HIS MOST SACRED NAME YOU MUST WASH YOUR WHOLE BODY IF AFTER YOUR COPY HAS ITSELF BEEN EXAMINED THREE CORRECTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
5390-24512-0040_5339-14133-0048 THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
5390-24512-0044_2136-5143-0026 AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-24512-0046_1455-138263-0024 HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD

5390-30102-0004_4813-248641-0039 AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
5390-30102-0006_1455-134435-0056 AND WHILE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOVABLE WITHOUT ANY PRETENCE OR SHAM SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOUISE MERRICK AND ALLOW OTHERS TO READ HER AS SHE ACTUALLY WAS PATSY AND BETH THOUGHT THEY KNEW HER

5393-19218-0002_6437-66172-0022 THE MANNER OF MARRIAGE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS TO DAY FRANCE HAD NOT YET BORROWED FROM ENGLAND THAT SUPREME DELICACY OF CARRYING OFF ONE'S WIFE OF FLEEING
5393-19218-0003_302-123504-0033 ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS

5393-19218-0008_8468-286673-0018 MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
5393-19218-0009_4160-11549-0001 PROVIDED IT BE HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH
5393-19218-0010_4481-17498-0006 NATURAL AND COMMONPLACE AS THIS MATTER OF MARRYING IS THE BANNS TO PUBLISH THE PAPERS TO BE DRAWN UP THE MAYORALTY AND THE CHURCH PRODUCE SOME COMPLICATION THEY COULD NOT GET READY BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
5393-19218-0012_7780-274562-0037 AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
5393-19218-0014_7859-102519-0009 NOR EVEN TO SEE HIS HURT NOT EVEN COSETTE NEVERTHELESS THIS HAD FORCED HIM TO SWATHE HIS HAND IN A LINEN BANDAGE AND TO CARRY HIS ARM IN A SLING AND HAD PREVENTED HIS SIGNING M GILLENORMAND

5456-62043-0021_669-129061-0067 AND THEY DID LEARN IT ONCE IN A WHILE INDEED SEEING THEY HAD TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER THEY WOULD VENTURE A BET OF FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS COMPELLED TO BACK OUT BEFORE THE TREMENDOUS BRAGGING OF THE CAPTAIN OR PILOT
5456-62043-0022_2416-152137-0035 OR IF THEY DID VENTURE TO CALL OUT ON TWO BULLITS AND A BRAGGER THEY HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO FIND ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAD THE SAME KIND OF A HAND AND WERE MORE VENERABLE STILL WITH ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY CONTINUED PLAYING

5456-62043-0031_4640-19187-0013 THE PILOT WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN ON VERY BAD TERMS DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME AND SAID IN AN UNDERTONE FORTY APIECE FOR YOU AND I AND JAMES THE OTHER PILOT IS NOT BAD FOR ONE NIGHT I HAD RISEN AND WENT OUT WITH THE CAPTAIN TO ENJOY A VIEW OF THE BLUFFS
5456-62043-0032_2911-15084-0009 THERE WAS JUST FOG ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE VISION TAKING IN MORE THAN SIXTY YARDS SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN MY EXPECTATION WE WERE NEARING THE SHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING FOR WOOD THE BANKS BEING INVISIBLE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THERE IT IS EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN STOP HER
5456-62043-0033_7059-88364-0034 AND THE CAPTAIN HAILED HALLO THE WOODYARD HALLO YOURSELF ANSWERED A SQUEAKING FEMALE VOICE WHICH CAME FROM A WOMAN WITH A PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS IN PLACE OF A SHAWL WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD

5463-39173-0000_6476-57446-0054 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
5463-39173-0001_4397-15668-0029 INDEED AFTER WHAT MISTER SOWERBY HAD SAID AND AFTER LORD LUFTON'S ASSENT TO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS HE CONSIDERED TO DECLINE IT AND THEN TOO MISTER SOWERBY'S PROMISE ABOUT THE BILLS WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HIM AFTER ALL
5463-39173-0004_3879-174923-0041 THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS AT SUCH WINDFALLS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE FREE AND FREELY EXPRESSED ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS LADY LUFTON'S CONGRATULATIONS HAD NEARLY MADE HIM THROW UP THE WHOLE THING BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILES RE ENCOURAGED HIM
5463-39173-0006_1447-130550-0025 WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FROM MISTER SOWERBY SOME LITTLE TIME SINCE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBLIGING HIM HE MARK INTENDED TO SELL HIM AGAIN AS SOON AS HE COULD DO SO JUDICIOUSLY THIS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
5463-39173-0011_4195-186237-0012 THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
5463-39173-0014_8238-274553-0037 IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL AND THE FIELDS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK GREEN AND THE WIND HAD GOT ITSELF OUT OF THE EAST AND WAS SOFT AND GENIAL AND THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS WERE SHOWING THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS IN THE PARSONAGE GARDEN AND ALL THINGS WERE SWEET AND PLEASANT
5463-39173-0015_196-122152-0013 WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
5463-39173-0016_8468-286673-0023 ATONING TO HIS OWN CONSCIENCE FOR PAST SHORTCOMINGS BY PRESENT ZEAL AND THEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF THE ABSENCE OF HER DEAR FRIEND LADY LUFTON WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF NOT DISAGREEABLE MISSUS ROBARTS DID LOVE LADY LUFTON HEARTILY
5463-39173-0019_3240-131231-0074 BUT THAT IF THE PRICE OF DANDY COULD BE REMITTED TO HIM AT ONCE IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS OBJECT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN MISTER SOWERBY'S TONE ABOUT MONEY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HE WANTED TO RAISE THE WIND EVERYTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT
5463-39173-0020_4441-76250-0008 HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
5463-39173-0021_7367-86737-0083 HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
5463-39173-0023_1841-159771-0007 SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
5463-39173-0024_5750-35690-0029 THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
5463-39173-0030_8238-274553-0058 THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A DESTINY WHAT MORE OR WHAT BETTER COULD THE WORLD HAVE DONE FOR HER AND NOW SHE HAD THROWN ALL THAT ASIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ENDURE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD CALL HER A SCHEMING ARTFUL GIRL ACTUATED BY THAT FEAR SHE HAD REPULSED HIM WITH A FALSEHOOD
5463-39173-0034_1963-142776-0016 WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
5463-39173-0035_8975-270782-0094 THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
5463-39173-0039_2989-138035-0025 AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
5463-39173-0040_229-130880-0069 BUT SHE DID NOT BETRAY HERSELF PERHAPS HE MAY SHE SAID AND THEN GAVE THE PONY A LITTLE TOUCH WITH HER WHIP OH LUCY I WON'T HAVE PUCK BEATEN HE WAS GOING VERY NICELY I BEG PUCK'S PARDON
5463-39173-0044_118-124588-0013 OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
5463-39173-0046_7078-271888-0022 THERE IS I BELIEVE NOTHING IN HER MENTALLY WHATEVER MAY BE HER MORAL EXCELLENCES TO ME SHE IS MORE ABSOLUTELY LIKE A STATUE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING I EVER SAW TO SIT STILL AND BE ADMIRED IS ALL THAT SHE DESIRES AND IF SHE CANNOT GET THAT
5463-39173-0047_1116-132851-0020 TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
5463-39173-0049_5789-57195-0023 IF HE WERE YOUR BROTHER YOU COULD NOT BE MORE EAGER ABOUT IT NO I COULD NOT HE IS THE ONLY MAN FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS EVER INTIMATE AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD THROW HIMSELF AWAY IT'S HORRIDLY IMPROPER TO CARE ABOUT SUCH A THING I HAVE NO DOUBT
5463-39173-0050_5561-41615-0012 I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
5463-39173-0051_250-142286-0024 THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
5463-39173-0052_6437-66173-0017 THERE WAS THEN NOTHING MORE SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HOGGLESTOCK CLERGYMAN MISSUS CRAWLEY HAD BROUGHT TWO CHILDREN WITH HER WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE CORNISH CURACY TO HOGGLESTOCK AND TWO OTHER BABIES HAD BEEN ADDED TO HER CARES SINCE THEN
5463-39173-0056_1034-121119-0059 LIBERAL ACCORDING TO THE SCALE BY WHICH THE INCOMES OF CLERGYMEN IN SOME OF OUR NEW DISTRICTS ARE NOW APPORTIONED WOULD NOT ADMIT OF A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN LIVING WITH THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF AN ARTISAN'S FAMILY
5463-39173-0057_3879-173592-0028 AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
5463-39173-0059_1926-143879-0034 LUCY HAD NEVER SEEN MISSUS CRAWLEY THESE VISITS TO HOGGLESTOCK WERE NOT FREQUENT AND HAD GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ROBARTS TOGETHER
5463-39173-0060_3374-298025-0028 ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
5463-39173-0061_7447-91187-0021 BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
5463-39174-0001_2136-5143-0003 FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0003_7302-86815-0007 IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
5463-39174-0004_730-360-0015 MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0007_7505-258964-0046 A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0009_2002-139469-0101 SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
5463-39174-0012_8123-275209-0001 LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
5463-39174-0014_6925-80680-0064 AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0019_3436-172171-0025 THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0024_458-126294-0013 MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0025_4406-16883-0030 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER

5514-19192-0002_3526-176653-0006 IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
5514-19192-0003_3664-178355-0005 WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE RIOTS BECAME LEONINE AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED DANCE HALL AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED TO PRESERVE THE ORDER REPRESENTED BY A TEA GARDEN IN THAT BOURGEOIS AND HEROIC TIME
5514-19192-0005_118-47824-0016 THEY SHED THEIR BLOOD LYRICALLY FOR THE COUNTING HOUSE AND THEY DEFENDED THE SHOP THAT IMMENSE DIMINUTIVE OF THE FATHERLAND WITH LACEDAEMONIAN ENTHUSIASM AT BOTTOM WE WILL OBSERVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS THAT WAS NOT EXTREMELY SERIOUS
5514-19192-0006_2836-5354-0000 IT WAS SOCIAL ELEMENTS ENTERING INTO STRIFE WHILE AWAITING THE DAY WHEN THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO EQUILIBRIUM ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE ANARCHY MINGLED WITH GOVERNMENTALISM THE BARBAROUS NAME OF THE CORRECT PARTY
5514-19192-0008_2289-152253-0004 SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
5514-19192-0010_8098-278278-0006 IT SET UP THE CRY OF ALARM EACH CONSTITUTING HIMSELF A CENTRE DEFENDED IT SUCCORED IT AND PROTECTED IT WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND THE FIRST COMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAVE SOCIETY ZEAL SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO EXTERMINATION
5514-19192-0012_3240-131232-0001 WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE MONARCHY IN EUROPE THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES ON ONE DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER
5514-19192-0013_4640-19188-0001 WAS PURSUED IN THE PLACE ROYALE WITH A BAYONET AT HIS LOINS
5514-19192-0016_8063-274112-0005 OUT OF CAPRICE AND ITS OWN GOOD PLEASURE THIS FACT SINGULAR THOUGH IT MAY SEEM WAS PROVED AT THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION OPENED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INSURRECTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO CAPTAIN FANNICOT A BOLD AND IMPATIENT BOURGEOIS
5514-19192-0019_3982-178459-0012 AND WHO WERE ALLOWING THE INSURRECTION TO FRY IN ITS OWN FAT TO USE THE CELEBRATED EXPRESSION OF ONE OF THEM FOR HIS PART HE THOUGHT THE BARRICADE RIPE AND AS THAT WHICH IS RIPE OUGHT TO FALL HE MADE THE ATTEMPT

5514-19192-0026_5022-29411-0040 THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN MEN KILLED AND THEY ARE USING UP OUR AMMUNITION FOR NOTHING
5514-19192-0027_3242-67153-0010 INSURRECTION AND REPRESSION DO NOT FIGHT WITH EQUAL WEAPONS INSURRECTION WHICH IS SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED HAS ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHOTS TO FIRE AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COMBATANTS TO EXPEND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE BOX A MAN KILLED CANNOT BE REPLACED
5514-19192-0029_1069-133699-0007 THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
5514-19192-0032_3214-167607-0032 PASSING GLEAMS IN THE CHAOS OF SENTIMENTS AND PASSIONS WHICH DEFEND A BARRICADE THERE IS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS BRAVERY THERE IS YOUTH HONOR ENTHUSIASM THE IDEAL CONVICTION

5514-19192-0041_831-130746-0058 THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP MASSES OF

5514-19192-0050_226-131532-0025 COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
5514-19193-0001_911-128684-0084 CONTINUED TO INSULT THE CANNON AND EACH TIME THAT THAT GLOOMY CLOUD OF PROJECTILES WHICH IS CALLED GRAPE SHOT PASSED OVERHEAD WITH ITS TERRIBLE SOUND HE ASSAILED IT WITH A BURST OF IRONY YOU ARE WEARING OUT YOUR LUNGS POOR BRUTAL OLD FELLOW

5514-19193-0010_4406-16882-0015 THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
5514-19193-0012_5022-29411-0006 THE OBJECT OF THIS MODE OF FIRING WAS TO DRIVE THE INSURGENTS FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE REDOUBT AND TO COMPEL THEM TO GATHER CLOSE IN THE INTERIOR THAT IS TO SAY THIS ANNOUNCED THE ASSAULT THE COMBATANTS ONCE DRIVEN FROM THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE BY BALLS AND

5514-19193-0021_8063-274116-0017 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL OF BODIES TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE

5561-41616-0024_7517-100442-0001 THEY PLAYED SUCH A CLOSE GUARDING GAME THAT TRY AS THEY MIGHT THE JUNIORS MADE NO HEADWAY THEN JULIA CROSBY SCORED ON A FIELD GOAL MAKING THE SCORE THREE TO TWO THIS SPURRED THE JUNIOR TEAM ON TO GREATER EFFORT AND MIRIAM MADE A BRILLIANT THROW TO BASKET THAT BROUGHT FORTH AN OVATION FROM THE GALLERY
5561-41616-0025_1263-138246-0026 THIS ENDED THE FIRST HALF WITH THE SCORE FIVE TO TWO IN FAVOR OF THE JUNIORS THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK TO CATCH UP WITH US NOW SAID NORA O'MALLEY TRIUMPHANTLY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAM WHO SAT RESTING IN THE LITTLE SIDE ROOM OFF THE GYMNASIUM WE HAVE THE LEAD BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BOAST YET REPLIED GRACE

5561-41616-0036_233-155990-0018 HARD TO TELL SAID NORA THEY HISSED MISS THOMPSON VERY SOFTLY YOU MAY BE SURE CONTINUED JESSICA BUT IT WAS HISSING JUST THE SAME
5561-41616-0038_5456-24741-0015 SHE TALKED FOR A MOMENT TO EDNA AND ELEANOR THEY TOSSED THEIR HEADS BUT THEY DIDN'T HISS ANY MORE WHAT DID RUTH SAY TO THEM ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY
5652-19215-0002_302-123523-0031 SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF VIOLETS HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH A CREATURE
5652-19215-0003_4214-7146-0054 MARIUS MY BOY YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE RICH DON'T GO TO PETTIFOGGING I BEG OF YOU
5652-19215-0004_4898-28461-0025 THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING FOR US
5652-19215-0006_2289-152258-0012 AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
5652-19215-0007_8747-293952-0022 A SURE MEANS OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO THE CONVENT
5652-19215-0008_1116-137572-0043 PICPUS INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF PATERNITY
5652-19215-0009_7278-246956-0005 OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
5652-19215-0010_4362-15663-0103 SHE WAS DECLARED AN ORPHAN BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER BEING DEAD
5652-19215-0011_1737-142397-0028 THAT HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN
5652-19215-0013_6367-65536-0068 BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY
5652-19215-0014_1594-135914-0005 WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
5652-19215-0016_7078-271888-0110 A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
5652-19215-0017_1723-141149-0104 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0019_2182-181173-0023 DAUPHINES WITHOUT A RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE
5652-19215-0021_4853-29413-0005 HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
5652-19215-0025_3112-9555-0038 THANKS MARIUS THAT IS PRECISELY THE IDEA OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A MAGNIFICENT DRESS OF TEA ROSE COLORED MOIRE ANTIQUE WAS ADDED TO COSETTE'S WEDDING PRESENTS
5652-19215-0028_3807-4955-0031 WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND WHICH
5652-19215-0029_198-126831-0031 EQUAL TO THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
5652-19215-0033_118-47824-0057 I GRANT TO THIS AGE THE DEVICE DIRTY CLEANLINESS
5652-19215-0034_2989-138028-0030 GIVE ME PERMISSION TO SPEAK I SAY NO EVIL OF THE PEOPLE AS YOU SEE I AM ALWAYS HARPING ON YOUR PEOPLE
5652-19215-0035_5514-19192-0023 I BELONG TO IT HE WHO LOVES WELL LASHES WELL THEREUPON I SAY PLAINLY THAT NOW A DAYS
5652-19215-0037_302-123523-0037 THAT JOYOUS LUXURY WHICH EVERY ONE POSSESSED MUSIC FORMING PART OF THE WEDDING A SYMPHONY ABOVE STAIRS A BEATING OF DRUMS BELOW STAIRS THE DANCES THE JOYOUS FACES ROUND THE TABLE
5652-19215-0038_311-124404-0107 THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF RIBBON I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE GIRDLE OF VENUS
5652-19215-0041_4267-78186-0017 HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM
5652-19215-0044_7517-100442-0005 ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
5652-19215-0046_8609-283227-0064 PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED THEMSELVES A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR OF A PRECIOUS STONE PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO BOOTS
5652-19215-0047_8098-278278-0003 THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
5652-19215-0050_5192-19397-0009 EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
5652-19215-0052_8108-280359-0027 WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
5652-19215-0055_7148-7763-0013 THE EMPYREAN WITH THE SWANS AND THE EAGLES EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO FALL BACK ON THE MORROW INTO THE BOURGEOISIE OF THE FROGS
5652-19215-0057_5750-100289-0060 RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES THIS DEVOTION
5652-19215-0062_460-172359-0059 THE FINEST IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID IT'S AN OLD PLAN OF MINE I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY CHAMBER
5652-39938-0002_8123-275193-0001 AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
5652-39938-0003_5049-25947-0108 IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
5652-39938-0004_89-219-0061 THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
5652-39938-0006_7067-76048-0059 THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5652-39938-0009_307-127535-0004 AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
5652-39938-0012_8797-294123-0054 BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
5652-39938-0014_2911-7601-0042 BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
5652-39938-0015_625-132118-0016 EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
5652-39938-0021_8098-275181-0032 SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
5652-39938-0022_3807-4923-0033 IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
5652-39938-0023_1040-133433-0061 THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0024_2196-174172-0032 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0025_4898-28461-0004 IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
5652-39938-0027_5750-100289-0083 NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
5652-39938-0029_6836-76549-0030 TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
5652-39938-0030_83-9960-0041 HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
5652-39938-0031_5104-33406-0055 OFTEN WITHIN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME THE BRAIN GATHERS THE ENERGIES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONS WITH UNAVOIDABLE SURROUNDINGS YET HERE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO ADJUST THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF OUTING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE SPECIAL CASE
5652-39938-0036_118-124588-0017 THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
5652-39938-0041_2843-152918-0109 THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0043_1069-133699-0005 WE MAY BEGIN EVEN WITH THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE DOUBT WHETHER NERVOUSNESS REALLY HAS INCREASED IN OUR TIME EARLIER PERIODS HAD NOT SO MANY NAMES FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE THEM WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
5652-39938-0045_1069-133709-0004 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0046_1088-129236-0005 THE PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC HYGIENE HAS BROUGHT EVERYONE MUCH NEARER TO A HARMONIOUS FUNCTIONING OF THE ORGANISM AND THE PROGRESS OF TECHNIQUE HAS REMOVED INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE PLAY OF LIFE
5652-39938-0047_4898-28461-0047 OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
5652-39938-0048_6563-285357-0012 THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
5652-39938-0049_3168-173565-0052 MOREOVER OUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY BECOME COOLER THERE IS LESS EMOTIONALISM LESS SENTIMENTALITY MORE BUSINESS LIKE ATTITUDE AND THAT ALL MEANS LESS INNER FRICTION AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC LIFE TOO LESS FEAR OF WAR AND LESS RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE
5652-39938-0051_5678-43303-0005 IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
5652-39938-0055_40-222-0044 COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
5652-39938-0058_248-130697-0018 BUT PROBABLY EACH OF THEM DOES BETTER TO GO ON THAN SIMPLY TO SWEAR OFF ALTOGETHER THEIR REST OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF VACATION THAT MEANS INTERRUPTIONS WITHOUT THE USUAL ACTIVITY OUGHT TO BE SHORT PERIODS SPENT WITH THE DISTINCT FEELING
5652-39938-0059_4195-186238-0012 THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
5652-39938-0060_4853-27670-0018 STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
5652-39938-0065_3112-9555-0017 WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
5678-43301-0004_7067-76048-0050 AND THIS PLATFORM WAS HUNG WITH ROSES SURMOUNTED BY A SOUNDING BOARD AND SET WITH A CHAIR AND TABLE THE WHOLE SQUARE ROUND ABOUT WAS PAVED WITH HEADS AND RESONANT WITH SOUND THE MURMURS OF THOUSANDS OF VOICES
5678-43301-0007_7780-274562-0028 GARDEN BEDS OF COLOUR BEHIND THE MUTE WHITE STATUES THAT FACED OUTWARDS ROUND THE SQUARE FROM BRAITHWAITE IN FRONT PAST THE VICTORIANS JOHN DAVIDSON JOHN BURNS AND THE REST ROUND TO HAMPDEN AND DE MONTFORT TOWARDS THE NORTH
5678-43301-0009_839-130898-0044 NOR THE LIONS TO THE NEW ART AND IN THEIR PLACE STRETCHED A WIDE PAVEMENT BROKEN BY SLOPES OF STEPS THAT LED UP TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY OVERHEAD THE ROOFS SHOWED CROWDED FRIEZES OF HEADS AGAINST THE BLUE SUMMER SKY
5678-43301-0010_911-128684-0055 NOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS IT WAS ESTIMATED IN THE EVENING PAPERS WERE COLLECTED WITHIN SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE PLATFORM BY NOON AS THE CLOCKS BEGAN TO TELL THE HOUR TWO FIGURES APPEARED FROM BEHIND THE STATUE AND CAME FORWARD AND IN AN INSTANT
5678-43301-0011_3112-9555-0026 THE MURMURS OF TALK ROSE INTO CHEERING OLD LORD PEMBERTON CAME FIRST A GREY HAIRED UPRIGHT MAN WHOSE FATHER HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN DENOUNCING THE HOUSE OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER ON THE OCCASION OF ITS FALL OVER SEVENTY YEARS AGO AND HIS SON HAD SUCCEEDED HIM WORTHILY
5678-43301-0012_8580-287364-0035 AND IT WAS HE WHO WAS TO BE CHAIRMAN ON THIS AUSPICIOUS OCCASION BEHIND HIM CAME OLIVER BAREHEADED AND SPRUCE AND EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE HIS MOTHER AND WIFE COULD SEE HIS BRISK MOVEMENT
5678-43301-0015_6000-86686-0024 HAD BEEN COMPOSED WITH BOTH SKILL AND ARDOUR THEY HAD A RELIGIOUS RING THE UNINTELLIGENT CHRISTIAN COULD SING THEM WITHOUT A QUALM YET THEIR SENSE WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THE OLD HUMAN CREED THAT MAN WAS ALL EVEN CHRIST'S WORDS THEMSELVES WERE QUOTED
5678-43301-0016_7148-7763-0002 THE KINGDOM OF GOD IT WAS SAID LAY WITHIN THE HUMAN HEART AND THE GREATEST OF ALL GRACES WAS CHARITY SHE GLANCED AT MABEL AND SAW THAT THE GIRL WAS SINGING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WITH HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND'S DARK FIGURE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
5678-43301-0021_8425-287387-0011 HE ENUMERATED THE REFORMS PASSED FIFTY YEARS BEFORE ON THIS VERY DAY BY WHICH THE NATION ONCE AND FOR ALL DECLARED THE GLORY OF POVERTY AND MAN'S SYMPATHY WITH THE UNFORTUNATE SO HE HAD TOLD THEM HE WAS TO SING THE PRAISE OF PATIENT POVERTY
5678-43301-0022_625-132112-0046 AND ITS REWARD AND THAT HE SUPPOSED TOGETHER WITH A FEW PERIODS ON THE REFORM OF THE PRISON LAWS WOULD FORM THE FIRST HALF OF HIS SPEECH THE SECOND PART WAS TO BE A PANEGYRIC OF BRAITHWAITE TREATING HIM AS THE PRECURSOR OF A MOVEMENT THAT EVEN NOW HAD BEGUN
5678-43301-0023_4830-25904-0011 OLD MISSUS BRAND LEANED BACK IN HER SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER THE WINDOW WHERE THEY SAT HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR THEM TWO ARM CHAIRS FILLED THE SPACE BUT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THERE WERE OTHERS STANDING VERY SILENT NOW CRANING FORWARD WATCHING TOO WITH PARTED LIPS
5678-43301-0024_7067-76047-0032 A COUPLE OF WOMEN WITH AN OLD MAN DIRECTLY BEHIND AND OTHER FACES VISIBLE AGAIN BEHIND THEM THEIR OBVIOUS ABSORPTION MADE THE OLD LADY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HER DISTRACTION AND SHE TURNED RESOLUTELY ONCE MORE TO THE SQUARE AH HE WAS WORKING UP NOW TO HIS PANEGYRIC
5678-43301-0025_5463-39173-0055 THE TINY DARK FIGURE WAS BACK A YARD NEARER THE STATUE AND AS SHE LOOKED HIS HAND WENT UP AND HE WHEELED POINTING AS A MURMUR OF APPLAUSE DROWNED FOR AN INSTANT THE MINUTE RESONANT VOICE THEN AGAIN HE WAS FORWARD HALF CROUCHING FOR HE WAS A BORN ACTOR
5678-43301-0027_201-127786-0062 THE OLD MAN AT THE TABLE WAS UP IN A MOMENT AND SIMULTANEOUSLY A VIOLENT COMMOTION BUBBLED AND HEAVED LIKE WATER ABOUT A ROCK AT A POINT IN THE CROWD IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE RAILED SPACE WHERE THE BANDS WERE MASSED AND DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE FRONT OF THE PLATFORM
5678-43302-0003_328-129766-0026 BUT WELL I DARE SAY IT WAS MORE MERCIFUL BUT YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY ANXIOUSLY FROM HER CORNER I CALLED OUT TO THEM MOTHER BUT THEY WOULDN'T HEAR ME
5678-43302-0004_2764-36617-0005 MABEL LEANED FORWARD OLIVER I KNOW THIS SOUNDS STUPID OF ME BUT BUT I WISH THEY HAD NOT KILLED HIM OLIVER SMILED AT HER HE KNEW THIS TENDER TRAIT IN HER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT IF THEY HAD NOT
5678-43302-0005_7402-59171-0027 SHE SAID THEN SHE BROKE OFF AND SAT BACK WHY DID HE SHOOT JUST THEN SHE ASKED OLIVER TURNED HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT TOWARDS HIS MOTHER BUT SHE WAS KNITTING TRANQUILLY THEN HE ANSWERED WITH A CURIOUS DELIBERATENESS
5678-43302-0011_6437-66172-0042 SPEAKING IN DEFENCE OF HIS PRINCIPLES IT WAS AN INCALCULABLE GAIN FOR THEM AND LOSS FOR THE INDIVIDUALISTS THAT CONFESSORS WERE NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE AFTER ALL
5678-43302-0012_460-172359-0057 THE HUGE ELECTRIC PLACARDS OVER LONDON HAD WINKED OUT THE FACTS IN ESPERANTO AS OLIVER STEPPED INTO THE TRAIN AT TWILIGHT OLIVER BRAND WOUNDED CATHOLIC ASSAILANT INDIGNATION OF THE COUNTRY
5678-43302-0015_8465-246942-0025 THERE WAS SOME PASSION AND LOYALTY LEFT IN ENGLAND HIS MOTHER GOT UP PRESENTLY AND WENT OUT STILL WITHOUT A WORD AND MABEL TURNED TO HIM LAYING A HAND ON HIS KNEE ARE YOU TOO TIRED TO TALK MY DEAR HE OPENED HIS EYES
5678-43302-0017_8051-118101-0020 EVERYWHERE NOW LIGHTS WERE GLOWING A SEA OF MELLOW MOONS JUST ABOVE THE HOUSES AND ABOVE THE MYSTERIOUS HEAVY BLUE OF A SUMMER EVENING THE EFFECT HE SAID IT CAN BE NOTHING BUT GOOD IT WAS TIME THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
5678-43302-0018_1970-10594-0040 MY DEAR I FEEL VERY DOWNCAST SOMETIMES AS YOU KNOW WELL I DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN AFRAID SOMETIMES THAT WE WERE LOSING ALL OUR SPIRIT AND THAT THE OLD TORIES WERE PARTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY PROPHESIED WHAT COMMUNISM WOULD DO
5678-43302-0020_2391-145015-0020 AND SO DRAMATIC THE POOR DEVIL COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A WORSE MOMENT PEOPLE WON'T FORGET IT MABEL'S EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE YOU POOR DEAR SHE SAID ARE YOU IN PAIN NOT MUCH BESIDES CHRIST
5678-43302-0023_125-121124-0037 SHE LOVED TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS HIS CONFIDENT FLUSHED FACE THE ENTHUSIASM IN HIS BLUE EYES AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PAIN PRICKED HER FEELING WITH PASSION SHE BENT FORWARD AND KISSED HIM SUDDENLY MY DEAR I AM SO PROUD OF YOU OH OLIVER HE SAID NOTHING
5678-43302-0031_4898-20016-0001 TELL ME SOME MORE THERE IS NO MORE BUT IT IS JUST AS CERTAIN AS IT CAN BE THAT THIS IS THE CRISIS IF THE EAST CAN BE PERSUADED TO HOLD ITS HAND NOW IT WILL NEVER BE LIKELY TO RAISE IT AGAIN IT WILL MEAN FREE TRADE ALL OVER THE WORLD I SUPPOSE
5678-43302-0032_328-129766-0008 AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING BUT IF NOT WELL IF NOT THERE WILL BE A CATASTROPHE SUCH AS NEVER HAS BEEN EVEN IMAGINED
5678-43302-0034_5688-41232-0030 BUT HER IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO GRASP IT A DUEL OF EAST AND WEST UNDER THESE NEW CONDITIONS WAS AN UNTHINKABLE THING THERE HAD BEEN NO EUROPEAN WAR WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AND THE EASTERN WARS OF THE LAST CENTURY HAD BEEN UNDER THE OLD CONDITIONS
5678-43302-0038_4362-15663-0068 FOUNDED UPON THE SCRAPS OF NEWS THAT STOLE OUT FROM THE CONFERENCES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD FELSENBURGH'S NAME APPEARED MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVER OTHERWISE THERE SEEMED TO BE A KIND OF HUSH NOTHING SUFFERED VERY MUCH TRADE WENT ON
5678-43302-0039_5192-19397-0007 EUROPEAN STOCKS WERE NOT APPRECIABLY LOWER THAN USUAL MEN STILL BUILT HOUSES MARRIED WIVES BEGAT SONS AND DAUGHTERS DID THEIR BUSINESS AND WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE MERE REASON THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD IN ANYTHING ELSE THEY COULD NEITHER SAVE NOR PRECIPITATE THE SITUATION
5678-43303-0003_2182-150130-0027 SHE WAS SINCERELY FOND OF THE OLD LADY AND HAD ALWAYS FOUND HER PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE A QUIET SORT OF DELIGHT THE EFFECT OF HER UPON THE MIND WAS AS THAT OF AN EASY CHAIR UPON THE BODY THE OLD LADY WAS SO TRANQUIL AND HUMAN
5678-43303-0004_6385-220959-0002 SO ABSORBED IN SMALL EXTERNAL MATTERS SO REMINISCENT NOW AND THEN OF THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH SO UTTERLY WITHOUT RESENTMENT OR PEEVISHNESS
5678-43303-0007_7780-274562-0022 THE BREAKING OF A PIECE OF CHINA MORE IRREPARABLE THAN THE RUIN OF A PALACE IT IS SYNCOPE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE CAME IN SHE MAY DIE AT ANY TIME SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS THERE IS NO NEED TO TELEGRAPH FOR MISTER BRAND
5678-43303-0008_7794-295948-0014 HE MADE A LITTLE DEPRECATING MOVEMENT WITH HIS HANDS IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WILL DIE IT
5678-43303-0009_426-122821-0022 SHE ASKED NO NO SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS I SAID HE ADDED A WORD OR TWO OF ADVICE AS TO THE USE OF THE OXYGEN INJECTOR AND WENT AWAY THE OLD LADY WAS LYING QUIETLY IN BED WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AND PUT OUT A WRINKLED HAND
5678-43303-0010_5703-47212-0037 WELL MY DEAR SHE ASKED IT IS JUST A LITTLE WEAKNESS MOTHER YOU MUST LIE QUIET AND DO NOTHING SHALL I READ TO YOU NO MY DEAR I WILL THINK A LITTLE IT WAS NO PART OF MABEL'S IDEA TO DUTY TO TELL HER THAT SHE WAS IN DANGER
5678-43303-0011_2989-138028-0058 FOR THERE WAS NO PAST TO SET STRAIGHT NO JUDGE TO BE CONFRONTED DEATH WAS AN ENDING NOT A BEGINNING IT WAS A PEACEFUL GOSPEL AT LEAST IT BECAME PEACEFUL AS SOON AS THE END HAD COME
5678-43303-0012_2182-150130-0008 SO THE GIRL WENT DOWNSTAIRS ONCE MORE WITH A QUIET LITTLE ACHE AT HER HEART THAT REFUSED TO BE STILL WHAT A STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL THING DEATH WAS SHE TOLD HERSELF THIS RESOLUTION OF A CHORD THAT HAD HUNG SUSPENDED FOR THIRTY FIFTY OR SEVENTY YEARS
5678-43303-0013_196-122150-0025 BACK AGAIN INTO THE STILLNESS OF THE HUGE INSTRUMENT THAT WAS ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF THOSE SAME NOTES WOULD BE STRUCK AGAIN WERE BEING STRUCK AGAIN EVEN NOW ALL OVER THE WORLD THOUGH WITH AN INFINITE DELICACY OF DIFFERENCE IN THE TOUCH
5678-43303-0014_5750-100289-0034 BUT THAT PARTICULAR EMOTION WAS GONE IT WAS FOOLISH TO THINK THAT IT WAS SOUNDING ETERNALLY ELSEWHERE FOR THERE WAS NO ELSEWHERE SHE TOO HERSELF WOULD CEASE ONE DAY LET HER SEE TO IT THAT THE TONE WAS PURE AND LOVELY
5678-43303-0015_481-123720-0013 MISTER PHILLIPS ARRIVED THE NEXT MORNING AS USUAL JUST AS MABEL HAD LEFT THE OLD LADY'S ROOM AND ASKED NEWS OF HER SHE IS A LITTLE BETTER I THINK SAID MABEL SHE MUST BE VERY QUIET ALL DAY THE SECRETARY BOWED AND TURNED ASIDE INTO OLIVER'S ROOM
5678-43303-0016_7067-76047-0014 WHERE A HEAP OF LETTERS LAY TO BE ANSWERED A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER AS MABEL WENT UPSTAIRS ONCE MORE SHE MET MISTER PHILLIPS COMING DOWN HE LOOKED A LITTLE FLUSHED UNDER HIS SALLOW SKIN MISSUS BRAND SENT FOR ME HE SAID SHE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK TO NIGHT
5678-43303-0019_1594-135914-0124 SHE WAS NOT OFFENDED FOR SHE TRUSTED HER HUSBAND TOO WELL BUT SHE WENT ON INTO THE SICK ROOM WITH HER HEART BEATING THE OLD LADY TOO SEEMED EXCITED SHE LAY IN BED WITH A CLEAR FLUSH IN HER WHITE CHEEKS AND HARDLY SMILED AT ALL TO THE GIRL'S GREETING
5678-43303-0021_1723-141149-0043 HE WILL BE BACK TO DINNER WILL HE NOT IF THE VOLOR IS NOT LATE NOW MOTHER ARE YOU READY FOR BREAKFAST MABEL PASSED AN AFTERNOON OF CONSIDERABLE AGITATION IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
5678-43303-0024_3242-67168-0010 NEITHER DID SHE LIKE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SO SHE WALKED BY HERSELF IN THE GARDEN THINKING AND HOPING AND FEARING TILL THE LONG SHADOW LAY ACROSS THE PATH AND THE TUMBLED PLATFORM OF ROOFS WAS BATHED IN A DUSTY GREEN HAZE FROM THE WEST
5678-43303-0025_2911-15045-0013 AS SHE CAME IN SHE TOOK UP THE EVENING PAPER BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS THERE EXCEPT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONVENTION WOULD CLOSE THAT AFTERNOON TWENTY O'CLOCK CAME BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OLIVER THE PARIS VOLOR SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AN HOUR BEFORE
5678-43303-0026_8095-274345-0026 BUT MABEL STARING OUT INTO THE DARKENING HEAVENS HAD SEEN THE STARS COME OUT LIKE JEWELS ONE BY ONE
5678-43303-0030_8063-274117-0016 I DARE SAY HE MAY BE KEPT IN PARIS THE OLD FACE ON THE PILLOW NODDED AND MURMURED AND MABEL WENT DOWN AGAIN IT WAS NOW AN HOUR AFTER DINNER TIME OH THERE WERE A HUNDRED THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE KEPT HIM
5678-43303-0031_5022-29411-0059 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN LATER THAN THIS HE MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE VOLOR HE MEANT TO CATCH THE CONVENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROLONGED HE MIGHT BE EXHAUSTED AND THINK IT BETTER TO SLEEP IN PARIS AFTER ALL AND HAVE FORGOTTEN TO WIRE
5678-43303-0032_4214-7146-0017 HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE WIRED TO MISTER PHILLIPS AND THE SECRETARY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE SHE WENT AT LAST HOPELESSLY TO THE TELEPHONE AND LOOKED AT IT THERE IT WAS THAT ROUND SILENT MONTH THAT LITTLE ROW OF LABELLED BUTTONS
5688-15787-0002_2136-5140-0031 WE WERE THEN ONLY TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES FROM FOREST CREEK AND I PROPOSED LOOKING FOR FRESH LODGINGS AS THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING AT WAS ANYTHING BUT RESPECTABLE THIS WAS AGREED TO AND WE SEARCHED AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING GOOD BEDS

5688-15787-0040_3664-178366-0029 AH SAID I I FORGOT THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY THREE POUNDS FOR IT
5688-15787-0042_1553-140047-0039 ITS ORIGINAL NAME HOWEVER WAS MOUNT ALEXANDER
5688-15787-0044_8629-261139-0022 WE GOT DOWN ABOUT FOUR FEET THE FIRST DAY AND WERE VERY TIRED OUR HANDS NOT BEING USED TO PICK AND SHOVEL WORK WERE VERY SORE THE NEXT DAY WE EXPECTED TO BOTTOM THE HOLE THE DIGGERS TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD STRIKE THE PIPE CLAY AT ABOUT SEVEN FEET
5688-15787-0045_5789-57158-0020 THE DEEPER WE WENT THE LABOR OF GETTING THE STUFF TO THE SURFACE WAS INCREASED AS EVERY BIT HAD TO BE DRAWN UP IN BUCKETS THE THIRD DAY WE GOT TO THE PIPE CLAY UNDER WHICH WAS FOUND A SMALL DEPOSIT OF GRAVEL
5688-41232-0001_1455-134435-0039 IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
5688-41232-0005_3857-182317-0014 HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SOME DESIGN SINISTER OR EROTIC ON WOMEN
5688-41232-0006_89-218-0002 ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
5688-41232-0007_5561-39621-0021 AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
5688-41232-0008_2289-152253-0012 TO BUILD UP THIS WORLD WIDE BELIEF REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION THIS PRIMITIVE THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION PROBABLY BRINGS BEFORE US IN ITS EARLIEST SHAPE THE SPECIAL AND INTIMATE BOND WHICH HAS EVER BEEN HELD TO CONNECT WOMEN
5688-41232-0013_289-121665-0045 BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE SEMITES AMONG THE LATER JEWS THE HOLY BOOKS DEFILED THE HANDS OF THE READER AS CONTACT WITH AN IMPURE THING DID AMONG LUCIAN'S SYRIANS
5688-41232-0014_4137-11701-0005 WELLHAUSEN HOWEVER DEALING WITH THE EARLY ARABIANS EXPRESSLY MENTIONS THAT IN PRE ISLAMIC DAYS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN WERE USED SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO WOMEN IN AND OUT OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0015_6064-56165-0007 AT A LATER DATE FRAZER DEVELOPED THIS ASPECT OF THE CONCEPTION OF TABOO AND SHOWED HOW IT OCCURS AMONG SAVAGE RACES GENERALLY HE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS AND POLLUTION NOT HAVING YET BEEN DIFFERENTIATED
5688-41232-0017_1246-124550-0009 IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOO WHICH FRAZER COMPARES TO AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR TO PRESERVE THE SPIRITUAL FORCE WITH WHICH THESE PERSONS ARE CHARGED FROM SUFFERING OR INFLICTING HARM BY CONTACT WITH THE OUTER WORLD
5688-41232-0023_198-129977-0024 THE SAME EXPLANATION APPLIES TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SAME RULES BY DIVINE KINGS AND PRIESTS
5688-41232-0024_3436-172171-0007 AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
5688-41232-0025_2007-149877-0056 DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
5688-41232-0028_5678-43302-0025 AND TO AFFECT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE A BEING WHO MUST BE SECLUDED OR AVOIDED FOR WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS PRESERVES SOMETHING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH THE ISOLATION WAS DUE EVEN OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL PERIODS
5688-41232-0029_8088-284756-0038 AND IN FACT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IS NOT MERELY INTERMITTENT IT HAS BECOME CHRONIC THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION LIVE SEPARATELY
5688-41232-0032_4362-15663-0075 THROUGHOUT BLOOD IS GENERALLY TABOO AND IT TABOOS EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH IT NOW WOMAN IS CHRONICALLY THE THEATRE OF BLOODY MANIFESTATIONS AND THEREFORE SHE TENDS TO BECOME CHRONICALLY TABOO FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
5688-41232-0035_1624-142933-0040 ARE PRECISELY THE SOURCE OF THE DREADED MANIFESTATIONS THUS IT IS NATURAL THAT THE FEELINGS OF AVERSION INSPIRED BY WOMEN ATTAIN THEIR GREATEST INTENSITY AT THIS POINT
5688-41232-0038_8747-293952-0008 AFTER HAVING HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN
5688-41232-0040_7780-274562-0069 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0041_118-121721-0006 IS IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STARRY BODIES
5688-41232-0042_3440-171006-0007 IN OUR OWN TIME THE SLOW DISINTEGRATION OF PRIMITIVE ANIMISTIC CONCEPTIONS AIDED CERTAINLY BY THE DEGRADED CONCEPTION OF SEXUAL PHENOMENA TAUGHT BY MEDIAEVAL MONKS FOR WHOM WOMAN WAS TEMPLUM AEDIFICATUM SUPER CLOACAM
5688-41232-0043_441-128982-0019 HAS LED TO A DISBELIEF IN THE MORE SALUTARY INFLUENCES OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FAITH IN HER PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ALONE SURVIVES IT MAY BE TRACED EVEN IN PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ONE MIGHT ADD MEDICAL QUARTERS
5688-41232-0044_7278-246956-0030 IN THE GREAT SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY FORBID A WOMAN TO ENTER THE FACTORY WHILE THE SUGAR IS BOILING OR COOLING THE REASON GIVEN BEING THAT IF A WOMAN WERE TO ENTER DURING HER PERIOD THE SUGAR WOULD BLACKEN
5688-41232-0045_198-129977-0009 FOR THE SAME REASON TO TURN TO THE EAST NO WOMAN IS EMPLOYED IN THE OPIUM MANUFACTORY AT SAIGON IT BEING SAID THAT THE OPIUM WOULD TURN AND BECOME BITTER
5688-41232-0046_4640-19187-0030 DECLARED THAT ONE OF THE WOMEN WORKERS MUST BE MENSTRUATING ALL THE WOMEN HINDUS MAHOMETANS ABORIGINAL GONDS ET CETERA SHOWED BY THEIR ENERGETIC DENIALS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS SUPERSTITION
5688-41232-0047_4680-16041-0006 ASKING WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT IF A WOMAN CURED HAMS WHILE MENSTRUATING THE HAMS WOULD BE SPOILED HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO HAPPEN TWICE ANOTHER MEDICAL MAN WROTE THAT IF SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUATING LADY DOCTORS
5688-41232-0048_4406-16883-0012 A THIRD WROTE IN THE JOURNAL FOR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THOUGHT THE FACT WAS SO GENERALLY KNOWN TO EVERY HOUSEWIFE AND COOK THAT MEAT WOULD SPOIL IF SALTED AT THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THAT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE JOURNAL
5688-41232-0055_1578-140045-0026 IT MUST BE ADDED TO THIS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT MERELY THE SURVIVING INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT PRIMITIVE BELIEFS BUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ACTUAL NERVOUS CONDITIONS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0056_4481-17498-0013 PRODUCING WHAT MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABNORMAL NERVOUS TENSION IN THIS WAY WE ARE DOUBTLESS CONCERNED WITH A TISSUE OF PHENOMENA INEXTRICABLY WOVEN OF FOLK LORE AUTOSUGGESTION FALSE OBSERVATION
5688-41232-0058_1363-139304-0038 WITH TINGLING AND PRICKLING SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS OF ATTRACTION OR REPULSION AT THE CONTACT OF VARIOUS OBJECTS THESE GIRLS BELIEVE THEIR GARMENTS STICK TO THEIR SKIN DURING THE PERIODS IT WAS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THEY COULD REMOVE THEIR SLIPPERS THOUGH FITTING EASILY
5688-41232-0060_6147-34606-0000 AN ORCHESTRAL PERFORMER ON THE DOUBLE BASS INFORMED LAURENT THAT WHENEVER HE LEFT A TUNED DOUBLE BASS IN HIS LODGINGS DURING HIS WIFE'S PERIOD A STRING SNAPPED CONSEQUENTLY HE ALWAYS REMOVED HIS INSTRUMENT AT THIS TIME TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
5688-41232-0063_6848-252322-0029 AND ARE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AT THIS TIME TWO YOUNG LADIES BOTH GOOD VIOLINISTS ALSO AFFIRMED THAT EVER SINCE THEIR FIRST MENSTRUATION THEY HAD NOTED A TENDENCY FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP AT THIS PERIOD
5688-41232-0064_3664-11714-0014 ONE A GENUINE ARTIST WHO OFTEN PERFORMED AT CHARITY CONCERTS SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED TO PLAY AT THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN EMBARRASSED TO FIND A PRETEXT THE OTHER WHO ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AT SUCH TIMES
5688-41232-0066_6081-42010-0000 BUT THAT THERE IS SPONTANEOUS BREAKAGE MOST USUALLY IT HAPPENS THAT A GLASS BREAKS WHEN IT IS BEING DRIED WITH A CLOTH NEEDLES ALSO BREAK WITH UNUSUAL FACILITY AT THIS TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED BY MERELY PLACING THE HAND UPON THEM
5688-41232-0068_1088-134318-0016 SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0070_4137-11701-0039 I ALLUDE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE MORE FAVORABLE SIDE OF THE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AS PRIESTESS SIBYL PROPHETESS AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS AGENT FOR GOOD AN ANGEL THE PECULIAR HOME OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT
5688-41232-0071_2911-15045-0029 THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF MENSTRUATION WITH THE IDEAS OF TABOO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STATE SANK INTO THE BACKGROUND AS CULTURE EVOLVED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEAS OF THE ANGELIC POSITION AND SPIRITUAL MISSION OF WOMEN
5688-41232-0072_3699-19402-0029 THE MORE FAVORABLE ASPECT OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WOMEN'S MAGIC FUNCTION HAS NEVER QUITE DIED OUT THE GRADUAL DECAY AND DEGRADATION OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW HAS ON THE WHOLE INVOLVED A LOWER ESTIMATE OF WOMEN'S NATURE AND POSITION
5688-41232-0074_625-132112-0048 AND SCHOPENHAUER AND EVEN NIETZSCHE HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO SIDE WITH THE PREACHER THAN WITH THE HALF NAKED PHILOSOPHERS OF TACITUS'S DAY BUT BOTH VIEWS ALIKE ARE BUT THE EXTREMES OF THE SAME PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION
5688-41232-0075_4051-11218-0013 AND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION FROM ONE EXTREME OF THE MAGICAL DOCTRINE TO THE OTHER WAS INEVITABLE IN AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION AS WE SEE THESE IDEAS HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE BASIS ON THE OLD STORY OF THE SERPENT

5703-47198-0006_2952-410-0018 SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GONE FURTHER AND SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD A LETTER FROM ENGLAND EXCEPT WHILE SIR ARTHUR WAS THERE ON LEAVE IT WAS A LARGE ENVELOPE ADDRESSED IN A CLERK'S HANDWRITING AND SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION AS SHE TORE IT OPEN

5703-47198-0020_6925-80680-0051 I OFTEN THINK THAT IF SHE HAD LIVED SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE NOW IF YOU PROMISED HER NOT TO ASK I WON'T ASK EITHER SAID JULIET LOYALLY BUT I HOPE THEY'LL TELL ME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WON'T IT IF THEY TELL ME WITHOUT MY ASKING

5703-47198-0027_7113-86041-0058 THE LETTER WAS PRODUCED AGAIN AND SHE JOINED HEARTILY IN THE EXCITEMENT IT HAD CAUSED YOU HAD BETTER START ON MONDAY SHE SAID TO JULIET THAT WILL GIVE YOU TWO DAYS TO PACK
5703-47198-0030_150-126107-0038 HAD SIR ARTHUR FORGOTTEN THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE HAVING LARGE DINNER PARTIES ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITHOUT JULIET TO HELP HER IN PREPARING FOR THEM SHE DID NOT KNOW
5703-47198-0031_2182-181173-0005 BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
5703-47198-0034_3526-176653-0021 SHE CAN WRITE OR CABLE TO US WHEN SHE HAS SEEN THE SOLICITORS AND IT IS NO USE PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER ARISE
5703-47198-0035_3168-173565-0053 A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
5703-47198-0037_7178-34645-0024 AND TO BREATHE THE GENTLE AIR FROM THE SEA THAT MET THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE GANGWAY ON TO THE STEAMER JULIET ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY WHEN THE CROSSING WAS OVER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO SET FOOT UPON HER NATIVE SOIL
5703-47198-0038_26-495-0076 SHE LEANT UPON THE RAIL IN THE BOWS OF THE SHIP WATCHING THE WHITE CLIFFS GROW TALLER AND MORE DISTINCT AND FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE UNDERSTOOD THE EMOTIONS
5703-47198-0039_7264-92316-0021 WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
5703-47198-0042_1334-135589-0080 THERE MAY EVEN BE A SCOTCHMAN AMONG THE PORTERS YOU KNOW BY SOME CHANCE NO FEAR SAID HER NEIGHBOUR GLOOMILY THEY'LL BE LOCAL MEN I HAVE NAE DOUBT
5703-47198-0043_8630-305212-0009 WHICH IS ONE OF THE BONNIEST THINGS YOU SEE ON THE CONTINENT TO MY WAY OF THINKING JULIET COULD GET NO ENTHUSIASM OUT OF HER AND LOOK WHICH WAY SHE MIGHT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANY REFLECTION ON THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HER OF THE EMOTIONS WHICH STIRRED IN HER OWN BREAST
5703-47198-0047_4362-15663-0027 SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0049_4340-15220-0022 OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE SHE COULD SEE A BLUE STREAK OF SKY ALREADY THE AIR HAD LOST THE TOUCH OF FRESHNESS WHICH COMES EVEN TO LONDON IN AUGUST DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING
5703-47198-0051_6529-62556-0031 BUT JULIET ONLY LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH PLEASURE AT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DAY SHE FELT THAT THE WEATHER WAS PLAYING UP TO THE OCCASION AS BECAME THIS IMPORTANT MORNING OF HER LIFE FOR THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE DID NOT DOUBT
5703-47198-0052_7278-104730-0041 SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
5703-47198-0053_4640-19189-0044 AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
5703-47198-0056_696-93314-0004 SCANDALIZED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH A PRECIOUS GARMENT BEING PUT ON BEFORE BREAKFAST THAT VERY ONE JULIET ASSURED HER UNDAUNTED AND WAS ARRAYED IN IT IN SPITE OF OBVIOUS DISAPPROVAL AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT
5703-47198-0057_5022-29405-0019 AND INQUIRING THEIR WAY TO BOND STREET FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE SHOP WINDOWS TO THEIR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THEY HAD IT ALMOST TO THEMSELVES FOR THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE LEFT IN THAT PART OF LONDON
5703-47198-0059_1963-142393-0021 BEFORE SHE STARTED TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SOLICITORS
5703-47212-0001_460-172359-0016 WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0004_839-130898-0092 ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
5703-47212-0009_7264-92316-0044 HIS MIND ALWAYS ACTIVE WAS BUSIER THAN USUAL AS HE WATCHED THE RIPPLES ROLL AWAY IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION FROM THE SIDES OF THE INVERASHIEL WHICH LOOKED SO STRANGELY LESS WHITE ON CLOSER INSPECTION
5703-47212-0011_7780-274562-0023 AS THEY DREW NEAR TO CRIANAN HE CONCEALED HIMSELF STILL MORE CAREFULLY BEHIND A PILE OF CRATES AND NOT TILL MISS ROMANINOV HAD LEFT THE STEAMER DID HE EMERGE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND STEP WARILY OFF THE BOAT
5703-47212-0012_1455-134435-0052 THE YOUNG LADY WAS STILL IN SIGHT MAKING HER WAY UP THE STEEP PITCH OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED HER DISCREETLY LOITERING BEFORE SHOP WINDOWS AS IF FASCINATED BY THE DISPLAY OF SCOTTISH HOMESPUNS
5703-47212-0013_1116-137572-0051 OR SAMPLES OF ROYAL STEWART TARTAN AND TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN FISHING TACKLE AND TROUT FLIES BUT THOUGH THE GIRL LOOKED BACK MORE THAN ONCE THE LITTLE MAN IN THE ULSTER WHO WAS SO INTENT ON PICKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE PUDDLES
5703-47212-0014_481-123720-0003 DID NOT APPARENTLY PROVIDE HER WITH ANY FOOD FOR SUSPICION AND SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY SHELTERED BENEATH THE UMBRELLA HE CARRIED AT LAST THEY LEFT THE COBBLE STONES OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND EMERGED UPON THE HIGH ROAD
5703-47212-0015_1898-145715-0010 WHICH HERE RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOORLAND IT WAS DIFFICULT NOW TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT UNOBSERVED AND GIMBLET BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN ENORMOUS CAIRNGORM
5703-47212-0016_5867-48852-0000 WHICH WAS MASQUERADING AS AN ARTICLE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LAST OUTLYING SHOP FROM THIS POSITION NOT WITHOUT ITS EMBARRASSMENTS SINCE A COUPLE OF BAREFOOTED CHILDREN CAME INSTANTLY TO THE DOOR WHERE THEY STOOD AND STARED AT HIM UNBLINKINGLY
5703-47212-0017_374-180299-0008 HE SAW THE RUSSIAN ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE MOOR AND LOOK WHERE HE WOULD COULD PERCEIVE NO MEANS OF KEEPING UP WITH HER UNOBSERVED UPON THE BARE SIDE OF THE HILL JUST AS HE DECIDED THAT THE DISTANCE SEPARATING THEM HAD INCREASED TO AN EXTENT
5703-47212-0018_8629-261140-0041 WHICH WARRANTED HIS CONTINUING THE CHASE HE JOYFULLY SAW HER SLACKEN HER PACE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A MAN WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING BEHIND A BOULDER BESIDE THE ROAD ROSE TO HIS FEET OUT OF THE HEATHER AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HER
5703-47212-0020_374-180299-0012 AND NEARLY FLED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HELD THE PROUD PROPRIETRESS A GAUNT GREY HAIRED WOMAN WITH KNITTING NEEDLES EVER CLICKING IN HER DEXTEROUS HANDS
5703-47212-0021_2952-410-0026 IN CONVERSATION UPON THE THEME OF ITS UNIQUE BEAUTIES UNTIL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED TO THE POINT OF COLLAPSE EVERY OTHER MINUTE HE MUST STROLL TO THE DOOR AND TAKE A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD A FRIEND HE EXPLAINED HAD PROMISED TO MEET HIM IN THAT PLACE
5703-47212-0022_302-123516-0023 AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0023_1963-142393-0046 AT LAST WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE PUT HIS NOSE ROUND THE DOORPOST HE SAW THAT THE PAIR HAD SEPARATED AND WERE WALKING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GIRL CONTINUING ON HER WAY WHILE THE MAN RETURNED TO THE TOWN
5703-47212-0024_587-54108-0008 HE WAS INDEED NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF GIMBLET PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE SHOP AND FASTENED UPON SOME PENCILS WITH A ZEAL NOT VERY CONVINCING AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING VACILLATION OVER THE BROOCH
5703-47212-0026_1263-139804-0008 TO HIM NOW GIMBLET DEVOTED HIS POWERS OF SHADOWING THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT THE MAN WALKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
5703-47212-0027_6181-216552-0052 NARROW POINTED FOOTPRINTS THAT WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED IN THE MUDDY PLACES HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE SAME AS THOSE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE BEACH ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL AT INVERASHIEL
5703-47212-0029_3214-167607-0004 HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0030_4481-17499-0004 BUT NOW HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AS HE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE WAS A TALL FAIR MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER BUT WITH NOTHING VERY STRIKING ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE A POINTED YELLOW BEARD HID THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE
5703-47212-0031_4267-78186-0032 AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
5703-47212-0032_4014-186176-0005 BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
5703-47212-0033_7264-92314-0002 HE'S AXTRA FOND O THE FEESHIN WAS THE REPLY FOR A THAT HE'S A FOREIGN SHENTLEMAN WAITING TILL THE BOAT HAD BECOME A DISTANT SPECK ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS GIMBLET MADE HIS WAY INTO THE INN AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LANDLORD
5703-47212-0036_2436-2476-0008 INDEED I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT GIMBLET ASSURED HIM I SUPPOSE YOU GET A LOT OF TOURISTS PASSING THROUGH THOUGH AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE

5703-47212-0041_7635-105661-0028 THE SECOND OF THE TWO LOCH STEAMERS WAS EDGING AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE PASSENGERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE DECK
5703-47212-0042_5192-19396-0027 AND IN THE BOWS OF THE VESSEL THE DETECTIVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JULIA ROMANINOV'S TWEED CLAD FORM SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL AND GAZING AT A DISTANT PART OF THE LOCH WHERE A BLACK SPECK
5703-47212-0043_8797-294123-0055 IT WAS AS GIMBLET HAD EXPECTED AND THOUGH HE CHAFED AT THE DELAY HE REGRETTED LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH THE ROB ROY THE INVERASHIEL WOULD BE DUE ON HER HOMEWARD TRIP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME
5703-47212-0045_1447-17506-0033 HE PROCEEDED TO THE POLICE STATION A SINGLE STORIED STONE BUILDING STANDING AT THE END OF A SIDE STREET HERE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE INSPECTOR AND IMPARTED INFORMATION WHICH MADE THAT PERSONAGE OPEN HIS EYES CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM
5703-47212-0047_5049-25947-0004 IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
5703-47212-0049_2817-142371-0039 THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
5703-47212-0051_7780-274562-0063 BY ALL MEANS SAID LADY RUTH I FEEL SAFER WITH THEM I EXPECT YOU WILL FIND MISS BYRNE UP THERE SHE HAS NOT COME IN TO LUNCH AND I THINK SHE PROBABLY MET MARK AND WENT TO LUNCH AT THE CASTLE SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO GO TO LUNCH ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN
5750-100289-0001_7511-102419-0031 I AM SURE I HAVE NOT MET ONE AND REALLY DO NOT KNOW OF ONE THE PRESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY POPULAR ERRORS WHENEVER AN INDIAN INDULGES IN ANY NOTORIOUS MISBEHAVIOR HE IS WIDELY HERALDED AS A CARLISLE GRADUATE
5750-100289-0003_5514-19192-0000 GIVING A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOME TRADE TOGETHER WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ENGLISH EDUCATION BUT NO LATIN OR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE CONSEQUENTLY ITS GRADUATES MUST ATTEND A HIGHER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN ENTER COLLEGE

5750-100289-0007_4088-158077-0062 A PARTICULARLY ABLE OR WELL EQUIPPED MAN OF THEIR RACE IS A PUBLIC BLESSING AND ALL BUT PUBLIC PROPERTY THAT WAS THE OLD RULE AMONG US UP TO A VERY RECENT PERIOD AN EDUCATED INDIAN COULD NOT SUCCEED MATERIALLY
5750-100289-0010_1081-125237-0067 AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE SUCH EFFORTS ARE GENERALLY USELESS AND RESULTED ONLY IN DAMAGE TO HIS FINANCIAL POSITION AND HIS REPUTATION NO DOUBT HE OFTEN INVITED ATTACKS UPON HIMSELF BY A RASHNESS BORN OF HIS ARDENT SYMPATHY
5750-100289-0011_7278-91083-0015 FOR HIS FELLOW TRIBESMEN IN THIS MATTER I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS LONG OBSERVATION EVEN IN THE OLD WILD DAYS AN EDUCATION WAS APPRECIATED BY THE INDIANS
5750-100289-0012_6880-216547-0042 BUT IT WAS A HARD LIFE FOR THE EDUCATED MAN THEY MADE HIM CARRY TOO HEAVY A BURDEN WITHOUT MUCH RECOMPENSE SAVE HONOR AND RESPECT BUT WE HAVE PRETTY WELL PASSED THROUGH THAT PERIOD AND THE NATIVE GRADUATES OF OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS

5750-100289-0082_4898-20016-0018 SHOULD WE DEVOTE OURSELVES LARGELY TO EXPOSING THE NUMEROUS FRAUDS COMMITTED UPON INDIANS OR SHOULD WE KEEP CLEAR OF THESE MATTERS AVOID DISCUSSION OF OFFICIAL METHODS AND ACTION

5750-35690-0014_8425-292520-0017 AESCULAPIUS HIS SON HAD HIS TEMPLES ERECTED TO HIS DEITY AND DID MANY FAMOUS CURES BUT AS LACTANTIUS HOLDS HE WAS A MAGICIAN A MERE IMPOSTOR
5750-35690-0015_5390-24512-0013 PERFORMED MOST OF THEIR CURES THE FIRST THAT EVER WROTE IN PHYSIC TO ANY PURPOSE WAS HIPPOCRATES AND HIS DISCIPLE AND COMMENTATOR GALEN WHOM SCALIGER CALLS FIMBRIAM HIPPOCRATIS

5778-12761-0000_1970-10594-0038 CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
5778-12761-0001_730-360-0020 ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
5778-12761-0004_1926-147979-0031 WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
5778-12761-0006_4640-19189-0001 WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
5778-12761-0008_2092-145706-0004 CARSON HAD ENTERED THE VALLEY ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BAY BUT THE COUNTRY THEN WAS SO ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WATER FROM SNOW AND RAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO CORRECT IMPRESSION OF WATERCOURSES
5778-12761-0009_7794-295955-0022 WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
5778-12761-0010_6880-216547-0055 THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
5778-12761-0012_3240-131231-0052 CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
5778-12761-0013_7800-283492-0004 IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL
5778-12761-0014_2092-145706-0019 BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK
5778-12761-0016_5808-54425-0058 IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WE STRUCK A FOOT PATH WHICH WE WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO KEEP AND THE GROUND WAS SOFT TO OUR ANIMALS FEET BEING SANDY OR COVERED WITH MOULD GREEN GRASS BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
5778-12761-0018_669-129061-0021 WE MEASURED ONE THAT HAD TEN FEET DIAMETER THOUGH THE HEIGHT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET ALL ALONG THE RIVER WAS A ROARING TORRENT ITS FALL VERY GREAT AND DESCENDING WITH A RAPIDITY TO WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN STRANGERS
5778-12761-0023_78-369-0063 NEARLY INTOXICATED US WITH DELIGHT AND WE HURRIED ON FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT TO ESCAPE ENTIRELY FROM THE HORRID REGION OF INHOSPITABLE SNOW TO THE PERPETUAL SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO
5778-12761-0024_6367-65536-0056 I STARTED AHEAD THIS MORNING WITH A PARTY OF EIGHT CONSISTING WITH MYSELF
5778-12761-0025_83-9960-0033 AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
5778-12761-0026_4160-14187-0018 NEAR NIGHT FALL WE DESCENDED INTO THE STEEP RAVINE OF A HANDSOME CREEK THIRTY FEET WIDE AND I WAS ENGAGED IN GETTING THE HORSES UP THE OPPOSITE HILL WHEN I HEARD A SHOUT FROM CARSON WHO HAD GONE AHEAD A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
5778-12761-0027_2764-36616-0009 LIFE YET SAID HE AS HE CAME UP LIFE YET I HAVE FOUND A HILLSIDE SPRINKLED WITH GRASS ENOUGH FOR THE NIGHT
5778-12761-0030_1363-135842-0050 CARSON AND I CLIMBED ONE OF THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS THE FOREST LAND STILL EXTENDED AHEAD AND THE VALLEY APPEARED AS FAR AS EVER
5778-12761-0031_1116-132851-0016 WE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY AT DEROSIER'S ABSENCE FEARING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEWILDERED IN THE WOODS CHARLES TOWNS WHO HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HIS MIND WENT TO SWIM IN THE RIVER AS IF IT WAS SUMMER AND THE STREAM PLACID
5778-12761-0033_4267-78186-0008 HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
5778-12761-0034_4441-76263-0018 IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING
5778-12761-0036_6476-57446-0036 AND UNAWARE THAT WE HAD ENCAMPED SO EARLY IN THE DAY WAS LOST WHEN NIGHT ARRIVED AND HE DID NOT COME IN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY SEARCH
5778-12761-0037_426-122821-0012 WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
5778-12761-0039_1069-133709-0010 AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK
5778-12761-0043_1263-141777-0009 BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS
5778-12761-0044_3947-13262-0036 WHO MISTAKING US FOR HIS FELLOWS HAD BEEN ONLY UNDECEIVED BY GETTING CLOSE UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO WITNESS HIS ASTONISHMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED HAD SOME OF THE OLD MOUNTAIN SPIRITS THEY ARE SO MUCH AFRAID OF
5778-12761-0048_5678-43301-0020 AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION
5778-54535-0001_3879-174923-0042 BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID
5778-54535-0003_4859-29340-0009 HE IS A DISTINGUISHED ARMY OFFICER AND A FINE ENGINEER HE IS NAMED FOR A GREAT OFFICER ANSWERED NICOLAS REMEMBERING OUR GENERAL WASHINGTON AND HE DISPATCHED A LETTER TO THE LOWELL ENGINEER
5778-54535-0004_4397-15668-0012 THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
5778-54535-0005_6209-34600-0020 BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT
5778-54535-0007_2136-5143-0014 BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
5778-54535-0008_226-131533-0004 ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP
5778-54535-0009_40-222-0019 JIMMIE HAD DELICATE FEATURES AND LONG SILKY BROWN CURLS THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE IN AMONG THESE WAS ONE WHITE LOCK THAT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD THIS LOOKED LIKE A TINY FEATHER
5778-54535-0011_2007-149877-0024 THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
5778-54535-0012_669-129061-0057 IT WAS A LONG HARD VOYAGE THERE AND POOR LITTLE CHARLIE DIED ON THE WAY THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE BETTER SAILORS AND WERE AS WELL AS COULD BE WHEN THEY MET THEIR FATHER THEY DID ENJOY THE STRANGE SIGHTS IN SAINT PETERSBURG
5778-54535-0018_1502-122615-0006 I WANT YOU TO BE SURE AND REMEMBER ABOUT THIS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN ACCUSED HIM OF BEING CROSS AND RUDE BUT AT THIS TIME I AM SURE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN NICER
5778-54535-0020_7226-86964-0029 THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
5778-54535-0021_5678-43301-0013 HE ALWAYS WAS AS POLITE TO HER AS IF SHE WERE THE EMPEROR'S WIFE THE MAJOR WORKED TOO HARD ON THE GREAT RAILWAY AND DIED BEFORE JAMES WAS FIFTEEN
5778-54535-0022_8770-295463-0023 THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND
5778-54535-0028_4267-78186-0024 HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON
5778-54535-0029_2136-5143-0010 IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0030_163-122947-0014 THE ROOM LOOKED SO BARE AND HOMELY THAT WHISTLER PAINTED A VERY GOOD IMITATION OF FURNITURE ROUND THE WALLS OF HIS ROOM SO GOOD IN FACT THAT A RICH MAN WHO CAME TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE IMITATION CHAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR
5778-54535-0031_3436-172171-0004 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID
5778-54535-0032_1970-26100-0024 JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED
5778-54535-0033_4018-103416-0005 HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AT LAST AND JUST AS LIFE SEEMED BRIGHT AN ART CRITIC MISTER JOHN RUSKIN DECLARED THAT THE WHISTLER PICTURES WHICH WERE BEING BOUGHT AT BIG PRICES WERE POOR VERY POOR
5778-54535-0034_374-180298-0049 MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE
5778-54535-0036_2764-36619-0002 THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
5778-54535-0038_441-128988-0019 WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM
5778-54535-0040_7635-105409-0000 TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
5778-54535-0041_7367-86737-0045 AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS
5778-54535-0043_4830-25904-0048 THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND
5778-54535-0044_405-130895-0014 JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES
5778-54535-0046_7794-295948-0013 HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK
5778-54535-0047_2136-5140-0014 YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5789-57158-0003_445-123860-0002 BUT ON THIS WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED A LETTER AND AS HE TOLD HIMSELF MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT LETTER HE CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE AND ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS
5789-57158-0004_4830-25898-0020 SHE WANTS YOU TO GO TO HER AT CHELTENHAM FOR A MONTH OH MISTER MORTON WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO HOW SHOULD I NOT LIKE TO GO LADY USHANT IS MY DEAREST DEAREST FRIEND IT IS SO VERY GOOD OF HER TO THINK OF ME
5789-57158-0005_6272-70191-0004 SHE TALKS OF THE FIRST WEEK IN DECEMBER AND WANTS YOU TO BE THERE FOR CHRISTMAS I DON'T AT ALL KNOW THAT I CAN GO MISTER MORTON WHY NOT GO I'M AFRAID MAMMA WILL NOT SPARE ME
5789-57158-0008_2007-132570-0047 AND MISSUS MASTERS HAD MORE THAN ONCE SAID THAT THAT KIND OF THING MUST BE ALL OVER MEANING THAT MARY WAS TO DROP HER INTIMACY WITH HIGH BORN PEOPLE THAT WERE OF NO REAL USE AND THEN THERE WAS MISTER TWENTYMAN AND HIS SUIT
5789-57158-0010_7078-271888-0111 IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN BEFORE ME THEN HE SAID WHAT HE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID I THOUGHT MISS MASTERS THAT YOUR HEAVEN WAS ALL HERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT MISTER MORTON
5789-57158-0011_8088-284756-0048 SHE ASKED BLUSHING UP TO HER HAIR OF COURSE SHE KNEW WHAT HE MEANT AND OF COURSE SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HIM EVER SINCE THAT WALK HER MIND HAD BEEN TROUBLED BY IDEAS AS TO WHAT HE WOULD THINK ABOUT HER
5789-57158-0012_8312-279790-0015 AND NOW HE WAS TELLING HER WHAT HE THOUGHT I FANCIED THAT YOU WERE HAPPY HERE WITHOUT GOING TO SEE AN OLD WOMAN WHO AFTER ALL
5789-57158-0015_3214-167607-0035 I CAN EXPLAIN IT ALL TO HER AND SHE WILL UNDERSTAND ME SHE HARDLY MEANT TO REPROACH HIM SHE DID NOT MEAN TO ASSUME AN INTIMACY SUFFICIENT FOR REPROACH BUT HE FELT THAT SHE HAD REPROACHED HIM
5789-57158-0016_4297-13009-0024 AT ANY RATE I WILL WRITE TO LADY USHANT AND WILL ASK PAPA TO LET YOU KNOW THEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM BUT TO GO AND YET HE WANTED TO SAY SOME OTHER WORD
5789-57158-0018_909-131044-0017 BECAUSE LADY USHANT IS KIND TO ME I NEEDN'T EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE SO REGINALD MORTON WAS OF COURSE THE OTHER PEOPLE THEN HE PAUSED A MOMENT I DID SO LONG HE SAID
5789-57158-0023_4297-13009-0016 I BELIEVE HIM TO BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER FOR HE EARNS HIS BREAD AND TAKES CARE OF HIS MOTHER AND AS FAR AS I KNOW DOES HIS DUTY THOROUGHLY I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE MISTER MORTON AND OF COURSE I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL IT
5789-57158-0024_5393-19219-0017 HE HAD COME THERE ARDENTLY WISHING THAT SHE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO GO TO HIS AUNT AND RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HER HIMSELF IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NOW HE ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT GO
5789-57158-0025_2092-145706-0080 IF SHE HAD MADE HER ELECTION SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO ABIDE BY IT IF SHE MEANT TO MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN WHAT GOOD COULD SHE GET BY ASSOCIATING WITH HIS AUNT OR WITH HIM
5789-57158-0026_460-172359-0089 HE WAS OF COURSE ALTOGETHER UNCONSCIOUS WHAT GRAND THINGS HIS COUSIN JOHN HAD INTENDED TO DO BY HIM HAD NOT THE HONOURABLE OLD LADY INTERFERED BUT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT DUTY REQUIRED HIM TO CALL AT THE HOUSE
5789-57158-0033_5514-19193-0002 AH YES HE DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY UNCLE BECAUSE REGINALD DIDN'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH AND HE KNEW HE OUGHT NOT TO SAY BROTHER BECAUSE THE ELDER BROTHER IN ENGLAND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD THE PROPERTY I AM MISTER JOHN MORTON'S COUSIN
5789-57158-0034_2836-5355-0048 I ASKED WHETHER YOU WERE THE OWNER OF THAT FARM HOUSE BECAUSE I INTRUDED JUST NOW BY PASSING THROUGH THE YARDS AND I WOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU SIR THEN REGINALD HAVING THUS DONE HIS DUTY
5789-57158-0035_1069-133709-0015 RETURNED HOME MARY MASTERS WHEN SHE WAS ALONE WAS AGAIN VERY ANGRY WITH HERSELF SHE KNEW THOROUGHLY HOW PERVERSE SHE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE DECLARED THAT LARRY TWENTYMAN WAS A FIT COMPANION FOR HERSELF
5789-57195-0001_5049-25947-0038 THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN INTENSELY ANXIOUS FOR THE MARRIAGE WISHING TO HAVE LARRY FOR A BROTHER LOOKING FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO THEIR SHARE IN THE UNRESTRICTED PLENTEOUSNESS OF CHOWTON FARM
5789-57195-0005_3240-131232-0012 SHE WOULD STILL COME AGAIN TO THE BATTLE A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD SHE SAID BRING LARRY TWENTYMAN BACK TO HIS COURTSHIP AND THAT WORD MIGHT BE SPOKEN IF MARY'S VISIT TO CHELTENHAM WERE FORBIDDEN
5789-57195-0007_7402-90848-0014 WAS THE VERY WAY TO PROMOTE THE DISEASE THIS MISSUS MASTERS SAID IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON NIGHT AND DAY TILL THE POOR HUSBAND LONGED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S DEPARTURE
5789-57195-0012_7402-59171-0018 THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
5789-57195-0014_5322-7678-0018 HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE HER AND WITH THAT WISH SHE WAS BOUND TO COMPLY OF COURSE SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE MARY AT BRAGTON OR IF THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE SHE HERSELF WOULD COME INTO DILLSBOROUGH

5789-70653-0000_1235-135884-0041 CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
5789-70653-0001_2002-139469-0004 HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF JOVIAL TEMPER WITH A STRONG INTEREST IN THE DRAMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLAND
5789-70653-0002_4195-17507-0018 THE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATS
5789-70653-0003_254-27760-0015 AND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5789-70653-0004_125-121124-0057 AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
5789-70653-0006_2136-5147-0029 PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
5789-70653-0007_8063-274112-0001 WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
5789-70653-0008_6848-252322-0014 PRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATIC
5789-70653-0009_5322-7679-0018 BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
5789-70653-0010_7859-102519-0040 HIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGE
5789-70653-0011_83-9960-0035 AND LIKED TO SLEEP IN A SMALL ROOM SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKE WHEN HE CAME UP BUT HAD BEEN HALF AROUSED AS USUALLY HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHT WAS SWITCHED ON IN HER HUSBAND'S ROOM SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
5789-70653-0012_3526-176651-0010 SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
5789-70653-0013_625-132112-0027 AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
5789-70653-0014_1183-133256-0018 HE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLY
5789-70653-0017_669-129074-0008 AND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
5789-70653-0018_8051-118101-0030 THE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOW
5789-70653-0019_4195-186236-0006 THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
5789-70653-0020_8088-284756-0019 IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE

5789-70653-0024_7059-77900-0040 I ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROL

5789-70653-0027_625-132118-0044 OF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOOR
5789-70653-0031_8312-279790-0049 SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR

5867-48852-0013_19-227-0046 HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE HATED CROSBIE CALLING HIM THAT MAN AND ASSURING HER THAT NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO INTO THAT MAN'S HOUSE THEN HE HAD WALKED AWAY MOODILY WISHING HIM ALL MANNER OF EVIL
5867-48852-0015_4014-186179-0016 HE HAD BEEN IGNOMINIOUSLY THRASHED BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL THIS BE IF HIS IMAGE WERE STILL DEAR TO LILY'S HEART I TOLD HER THAT I LOVED HER THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF THOUGH I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO
5867-48852-0018_7148-7763-0010 MISTER JOHN MAY I MAKE SO BOLD AND HOPKINS HELD OUT A VERY DIRTY HAND WHICH EAMES OF COURSE TOOK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS NEW AFFECTION I'M JUST GOING TO CALL AT THE SMALL HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D COME THIS WAY

5867-48852-0032_89-218-0009 EAMES WAS SO INTENT ON HIS OWN PURPOSE AND SO FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK BEFORE HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY RECEIVE MISSUS DALE'S TIDINGS WITH ALL THE INTEREST WHICH THEY DESERVED UNPACK THEM ALL AGAIN HE SAID
5867-48852-0036_289-121652-0026 OH YES MARY TOLD ME I'M SO GLAD OF IT I ALWAYS LIKED DOCTOR CROFTS VERY MUCH I HAVE NOT CONGRATULATED HER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A SECRET BUT CROFTS WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND IF IT IS A SECRET HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING IT
5867-48852-0037_118-47824-0028 I DON'T KNOW THAT I AM FOND OF SUCH SECRETS BUT AS SHE SAID THIS SHE THOUGHT OF CROSBIE'S ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN TOLD TO EVERY ONE AND OF ITS CONSEQUENCES IS IT TO BE SOON HE ASKED WELL YES WE THINK SO
5867-48852-0038_1235-135883-0042 OF COURSE NOTHING IS SETTLED IT WAS SUCH FUN SAID LILY JAMES WHO TOOK AT ANY RATE A YEAR OR TWO TO MAKE HIS PROPOSAL WANTED TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY AFTERWARDS NO LILY NOT QUITE THAT WELL MAMMA IT WAS VERY NEARLY THAT
5867-48852-0039_1034-121119-0013 I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I SHOULD SO MUCH LIKE FOR A BROTHER I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKE HIM VERY GLAD I HOPE YOU'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME LITTLE TENDERNESS IN THIS AS JOHN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF I'M SURE WE SHALL IF HE LIKES IT THAT IS IF I EVER HAPPEN TO SEE HIM
5867-48852-0040_5049-25947-0009 I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR HIM I CAN IF HE EVER COMES UP TO LONDON WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD THING MISSUS DALE IF HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN LONDON NO JOHN IT WOULD BE A VERY BAD THING WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER MISSUS DALE WAS SPEAKING OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0041_8095-274345-0002 BUT THE VERY ALLUSION TO ANY SUCH ROBBERY COVERED JOHN EAMES'S FACE WITH A BLUSH
5867-48852-0042_7178-34645-0029 AND FOR THE MOMENT SILENCED HIM YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE A BETTER CAREER IN LONDON SAID LILY SPEAKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER SUPERIOR PRESENCE OF MIND SHE HAD CERTAINLY SHOWN DEFECTIVE JUDGMENT IN DESIRING HER MOTHER NOT TO LEAVE THEM ALONE
5867-48852-0044_7264-92314-0025 AND SHE FELT MOREOVER THAT JOHN WAS ENTITLED TO AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE
5867-48852-0045_4267-78186-0029 BUT NOT THE LESS SHOULD HE HAVE IT OF RIGHT SEEING THAT HE DESIRED IT BUT YET MISSUS DALE DID NOT DARE TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM LILY HAD ASKED HER NOT TO DO SO AND AT THE PRESENT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ALL LILY'S REQUESTS WERE SACRED
5867-48852-0047_2159-179154-0007 TO SAY THAT YOU THINK WE SHALL NOT GO IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT YOU SUGGESTED IT THE TRUTH IS JOHN THAT HOPKINS CAME IN AND DISCOURSED WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL ELOQUENCE NOBODY DARED TO OPPOSE HOPKINS HE MADE US ALMOST CRY HE WAS SO PATHETIC
5867-48852-0050_8419-286667-0023 HE HAD SWORN TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE THE SMALL HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING LILY TO BE HIS WIFE IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE WOULD BE GUILTY OF FALSEHOOD TOWARDS THE EARL IF HE DID SO LORD DE GUEST HAD OPENED HIS HOUSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0053_7190-90543-0029 SHOULD HE GET UP BOLDLY AND ASK LILY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE ROSE AND GRASPED AT HIS HAT I AM GOING TO WALK BACK TO GUESTWICK SAID HE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO FAR TO SEE US
5867-48852-0055_8123-275216-0034 HAVE A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE YOU GO OH DEAR NO I THINK I'LL GO BACK THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S FIELDS AND OUT ON THE ROAD AT THE WHITE GATE THE PATH IS QUITE DRY NOW I DARE SAY IT IS SAID MISSUS DALE LILY
5867-48852-0056_5561-41615-0024 I WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD COME AS FAR AS THAT WITH ME AS THE REQUEST WAS MADE MISSUS DALE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER ALMOST BESEECHINGLY DO PRAY DO SAID HE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR WALKING
5867-48852-0057_2391-145015-0112 THE PATH PROPOSED LAY RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD INTO WHICH LILY HAD TAKEN CROSBIE WHEN SHE MADE HER OFFER TO LET HIM OFF FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WALK THERE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LOVER NO JOHN SHE SAID NOT TO DAY
5867-48852-0060_4014-186179-0025 LILY I HAVE COME OVER HERE ON PURPOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU INDEED I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON ONLY THAT I MIGHT SEE YOU HAVE YOU JOHN YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WELL ALL THAT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU
5867-48852-0063_3235-28433-0041 IF YOU ARE KIND TO ME YOU WILL LET THAT BE ENOUGH BUT YOU ARE SO UNKIND TO ME NO NO OH I WOULD WISH TO BE SO KIND TO YOU JOHN HERE TAKE MY HAND IT IS THE HAND OF A FRIEND WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU

5867-48852-0067_211-122425-0033 I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM ANY HOPE MAMMA TELL ME THAT I MAY COME AGAIN IN A YEAR HE PLEADED I CANNOT TELL YOU SO YOU MAY NOT COME AGAIN NOT IN THIS WAY
5867-48852-0071_5750-100289-0081 I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN AFTER AFTER IT IS TO ME ALMOST AS THOUGH I HAD MARRIED HIM
5867-48852-0072_60-121082-0073 I AM NOT BLAMING HIM REMEMBER THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A MAN SHE HAD NOT DROPPED HIS HAND AND AS SHE MADE HER LAST SPEECH WAS SITTING IN HER OLD CHAIR WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
5867-48852-0074_3440-171009-0009 TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE HIS SUIT AFTER SUCH A DECLARATION TO MISSUS DALE THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS SPEAKING OF A PERPETUAL WIDOWHOOD
5867-48852-0075_89-218-0026 AND TELLING OF AN AMOUNT OF SUFFERING GREATER EVEN THAN THAT WHICH SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
5867-48852-0077_5789-57195-0036 MISSUS DALE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT EAMES WAS COMING TOO SOON THAT THE EARL AND THE SQUIRE TOGETHER WERE MAKING AN EFFORT TO CURE THE WOUND TOO QUICKLY AFTER ITS INFLICTION THAT TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO HER GIRL TO RECOVER
5867-48852-0078_2911-12359-0016 BUT NOW THE ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE AND WORDS HAD BEEN FORCED FROM LILY'S LIPS THE SPEAKING OF WHICH WOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HERSELF I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAID JOHN AH YES
5867-48852-0079_6531-61334-0014 YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE YOUR HEART UNDERSTANDS MY HEART AND YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME AND SAY NAUGHTY CRUEL WORDS AS YOU DID ONCE BEFORE WE WILL THINK OF EACH OTHER JOHN AND PRAY FOR EACH OTHER AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER
5867-48852-0081_5678-43302-0024 YOU SHALL NEVER DO THAT YES I WILL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YET I WILL GOOD BY MISSUS DALE HE SAID GOOD BY JOHN
5867-48852-0084_4014-186183-0020 SAID MISSUS DALE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE LET HIM COME SAID LILY BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
5867-48852-0085_8312-279791-0014 AND THEY MEAN TO BE GOOD NATURED AND TO GIVE ME ANOTHER VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT LILY WENT AWAY BY HERSELF AND SAT ALONE FOR HOURS AND WHEN SHE JOINED HER MOTHER AGAIN AT TEA TIME NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID OF JOHN EAMES'S VISIT
5867-48852-0091_3982-182255-0000 AND REBUKED HIMSELF AS HAVING BEEN NOT ONLY FOOLISH BUT UNGENEROUS HIS FRIEND THE EARL HAD BEEN WONT IN HIS WAGGISH WAY TO CALL HIM THE CONQUERING HERO AND HAD SO TALKED HIM OUT OF HIS COMMON SENSE AS TO HAVE MADE HIM ALMOST THINK THAT HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN HIS SUIT
5867-48852-0094_1502-122619-0030 WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HE HAD SO FONDLY EXPECTED SUCCESS AS TO THINK ONLY OF HIS TRIUMPH IN RETURNING AND NOT OF HIS MORE PROBABLE DISGRACE HE HAD ALLOWED OTHERS TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM
5867-48852-0095_3699-175950-0015 AND HAD SO MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT NOW ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS WERE OVER FOR HIM HOW COULD HE ESCAPE AT ONCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BACK TO LONDON HOW COULD HE GET AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD FURTHER TO ANY ONE
5867-48852-0098_3486-166446-0038 AS IT WAS HE DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS PLACE IN THE EARL'S HOUSE HOW COULD HE PRETEND TO MAINTAIN HIS ORDINARY DEMEANOUR UNDER THE EYES OF THOSE TWO OLD MEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GET HOME TO HIS MOTHER
5867-48852-0099_5678-43303-0006 TO SEND A MESSAGE FROM THENCE TO THE MANOR AND THEN TO ESCAPE BACK TO LONDON SO THINKING BUT WITH NO RESOLUTION MADE HE WENT ON THROUGH THE WOODS
5867-48852-0100_7517-100429-0029 THERE HE STOPPED AND STOOD A WHILE WITH HIS BROAD HAND SPREAD OVER THE LETTERS WHICH HE HAD CUT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS SO AS TO HIDE THEM FROM HIS SIGHT WHAT AN ASS I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS AND EVER HE SAID TO HIMSELF
5867-48852-0101_3699-19402-0012 IT WAS NOT ONLY OF HIS LATE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HE WAS THINKING BUT OF HIS WHOLE PAST LIFE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS HOBBLEDEHOYHOOD
5867-48852-0102_19-198-0035 OF THAT BACKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN ASSUMING MANHOOD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF MAKING HIMSELF ACCEPTABLE TO LILY BEFORE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CROSBIE
5867-48852-0104_1743-142914-0014 THERE SHOULD BE SUCH PUNISHMENT BECAUSE OF THE INSINCERITY OF THAT MAN WHEN HE HAD THUS STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH DEEP ROUGH GASHES IN THE WOOD CUT OUT LILY'S NAME FROM THE RAIL
5867-48852-0105_3879-174923-0016 HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED AND WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE CHIPS AS THEY WERE BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM WHEN A GENTLE STEP CAME CLOSE UP TO HIM AND TURNING ROUND HE SAW THAT LADY JULIA WAS ON THE BRIDGE SHE WAS CLOSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0106_2893-139310-0035 AND HAD ALREADY SEEN HIS HANDIWORK HAS SHE OFFENDED YOU JOHN SHE SAID
5867-48852-0108_3699-19402-0020 WILL BE A CONSOLATION WHEN YOU ARE AS OLD AS I AM IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE HAD A HEART
5867-48852-0109_4362-15663-0089 AND JOHN I CAN UNDERSTAND HER FEELING NOW AND INDEED I THOUGHT ALL THROUGH THAT YOU WERE ASKING HER TOO SOON BUT THE TIME MAY YET COME WHEN SHE WILL THINK BETTER OF YOUR WISHES NO NO NEVER I BEGIN TO KNOW HER NOW
5867-48852-0111_6454-93938-0023 I SHALL NEVER WIN HER LADY JULIA AS HE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
587-41611-0001_3242-67153-0016 THAT EDNA WRIGHT HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL PURVEYOR OF THE NEWS AND IN THIS SHE WAS RIGHT EDNA HAD UNDER PLEDGE OF SECRECY TOLD IT TO A SOPHOMORE WHO IMMEDIATELY TOLD IT TO HER DEAREST FRIEND AND SO THE TALE TRAVELED UNTIL IT REACHED ELEANOR
587-41611-0002_374-180299-0019 WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
587-41611-0003_87-121553-0072 FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41611-0006_2836-5355-0037 AND WENT ABOUT MAKING MYSTERIOUS SIGNS TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER THEY MET THE VERY NAME OF THE SOCIETY WAS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY THOUGH NORA O'MALLEY WAS HEARD TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A BRANCH OF THE BLACK HAND
587-41611-0009_2989-138028-0015 GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
587-41611-0010_1970-10594-0025 THEY SEEM POSSESSED WITH IMPS THE PHI SIGMA TAU GIRLS AND A FEW OF THE GRINDS ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO BEHAVE LATELY IT'S LARGELY DUE TO ELEANOR I THINK REPLIED ANNE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME QUITE A POWER AMONG SOME OF THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS
587-41611-0013_7190-90543-0003 THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
587-41611-0016_7278-91083-0011 I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
587-41611-0017_27-123349-0038 THE PLAY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED UPON YET REPLIED GRACE BUT THE OBJECT OF IT IS TO GET SOME MONEY FOR NEW BOOKS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THE PLAN IS TO CHARGE FIFTY CENTS A PIECE FOR THE TICKETS AND TO GIVE EACH GIRL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM TO SELL
587-41611-0019_1624-168623-0013 YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
587-41611-0023_5463-39174-0043 WHO NOW THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN OPENED WANTED TO HEAR MORE OF ANNE'S VIEWS OF THE STAGE UNLESS ANY GIRL HAS REMARKABLE TALENT I SHOULD ADVISE HER TO KEEP OFF THE STAGE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY OF COURSE WHEN A GIRL COMES OF A THEATRICAL FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS
587-41611-0024_2893-139310-0005 LIKE MAUD ADAMS OR ETHEL BARRYMORE THEN THAT IS DIFFERENT SHE IS PRACTICALLY BORN BRED AND BROUGHT UP IN THE THEATRE SHE IS AS CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THOUGH SHE LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FROM BABYHOOD ALL THE UNPLEASANT FEATURES OF THE PROFESSION
587-41611-0027_60-121082-0071 SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
587-41619-0000_27-123349-0040 WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
587-41619-0001_2518-154826-0001 NORA WAS THE SECOND PHI SIGMA TAU TO UNDERGO THE ORDEAL AS SHE BRISKLY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINES THE ACTOR STOPPED HER TAKING THE BOOK FROM HER HE TURNED TO THE PART WHERE TOUCHSTONE QUAINTLY HUMOROUS HOLDS FORTH UPON THE LIE SEVEN TIMES REMOVED
587-41619-0005_5163-39921-0042 AND ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT THEN ELEANOR'S TURN CAME HANDING HER COAT WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN OFF AND CARRIED UPON HER ARM TO EDNA WRIGHT SHE WALKED PROUDLY OVER THEN WITHOUT A TRACE OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
587-41619-0006_3242-67168-0037 BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
587-41619-0008_8770-295465-0034 NO OTHER GIRLS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NORA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO READ AS MUCH OF ANY SCENE AS THEY TWO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO READ BUT ELEANOR HAD RECKONED WITHOUT HER HOST FOR THERE WAS ONE GIRL WHO HAD NOT AS YET COME TO THE FRONT
587-41619-0012_2196-170151-0004 AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
587-41619-0014_1578-6379-0008 I WANTED HER TO PLAY ROSALIND AND I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT LOOK GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HER TRUE ENOUGH ANNE WAS SHYLY SHAKING HANDS WITH THE GREAT ACTOR WHO WAS CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY UPON HER RECENT EFFORT
587-41619-0016_909-131041-0010 IF I AM ANYWHERE NEAR HERE WHEN YOUR PLAY IS ENACTED I SHALL MAKE IT A POINT TO COME AND SEE IT SHAKING HANDS WARMLY WITH MISS TEBBS AND BOWING TO THE ADMIRING GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD HURRIEDLY DEPARTED LEAVING HIS AUDIENCE DEVOURED WITH CURIOSITY AS TO THE CHOSEN ONES
587-41619-0018_4397-15668-0022 BUT SHE WAS TOO OVERCOME TO THANK THEM AND SMILED AT THEM THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS LOOK AT ELEANOR WHISPERED NORA TO GRACE SHE'S SO ANGRY SHE CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT SHE MUST HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ROSALIND HERSELF
587-41619-0019_78-369-0042 I TOLD YOU SHE'D SULK IF SHE COULDN'T BE THE LEADING LADY GRACE GLANCED OVER TOWARD ELEANOR WHO STOOD BITING HER LIP HER HANDS CLENCHED AND HER FACE SET IN ANGRY LINES SHE LOOKS LIKE THE VENDETTA OR THE CAMORRA
587-41619-0020_125-121342-0004 OR SOME OTHER ITALIAN VENGEANCE AGENCY DOESN'T SHE SAID NORA WITH A GIGGLE GRACE LAUGHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF AT NORA'S REMARK BUT REGRETTED IT THE NEXT MOMENT FOR ELEANOR SAW THE GLANCES DIRECTED TOWARD HER AND HEARD NORA'S GIGGLE
587-41619-0021_6367-74004-0030 THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC

587-41619-0025_426-122822-0012 CONSIDERING THAT SHE ISN'T ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH ANY OF US HAD THE GIRL CHUMS KNOWN THEN WHAT ELEANOR WAS UP TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO ALL OF THEM AFTER IMPERIOUSLY COMMANDING HER SATELLITES TO WAIT FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41619-0027_1624-142933-0027 AND YOU CAN WIN PLENTY OF APPLAUSE PLAYING IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT ONCE HAVING GIVEN OUT A PART I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM THE GIRL I HAD GIVEN IT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OTHER GIRL DESIRED IT THAT WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNJUST
587-41619-0028_1034-121119-0032 STOOD AWAITING HER REPLY I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ELEANOR SAID SLOWLY A CURIOUS LIGHT IN HER EYES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TEBBS

6019-3185-0000_2182-150130-0026 THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
6019-3185-0002_2910-131096-0050 AND DESERVES THE DEEP ATTENTION OF COMING GENERATIONS IN THEIR STRUGGLE AFTER HUMAN IMPROVEMENT NOT MERELY IN ITS OWN LIMITED FIELD OF INTEREST DIRECTLY AWAKENED BUT IN ALL ANALOGOUS FIELDS OF INTEREST
6019-3185-0003_6147-34605-0002 AS IN FACT ALREADY AND MORE THAN ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE VERY EVENTS THIS LESSON HAS OBTAINED THE EFFECTUAL ATTENTION OF CHRISTIAN KINGS AND PRINCES ASSEMBLED IN CONGRESS
6019-3185-0005_2691-156755-0015 IN A STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A WEST INDIAN HURRICANE AND WHICH DID SERIOUSLY THREATEN AT ONE TIME TO DEPOPULATE OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH THE DARK SUSPICIONS WHICH SETTLED UPON ITS MEMBERS AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF GENEROUS INDIGNATION IN REPELLING THEM
6019-3185-0007_730-360-0039 IN EVERY ONE OF WHICH THESE PRECAUTIONARY AIDS HAD FAILED TO YIELD THE SLIGHTEST ASSISTANCE THE HORROR THE PERFECT FRENZY OF FEAR WHICH SEIZED UPON THE TOWN AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE BAFFLES ALL ATTEMPT AT DESCRIPTION
6019-3185-0008_3486-166446-0011 THE ASTOUNDED POLICE AFTER AN EXAMINATION THE MOST SEARCHING PURSUED FROM DAY TO DAY
6019-3185-0009_8312-279791-0021 HAD FINALLY PRONOUNCED THAT NO ATTEMPT APPARENTLY HAD BEEN MADE TO BENEFIT BY ANY OF THE SIGNALS PRECONCERTED THAT NO FOOTSTEP APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION THEN AND AFTER THAT RESULT
6019-3185-0010_2764-36617-0002 AND THE GENERAL FEELING AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME BY A GRAVE CITIZEN WHOM I MET IN A MORNING WALK FOR THE OVERMASTERING SENSE OF A PUBLIC CALAMITY BROKE DOWN EVERY BARRIER OF RESERVE AND ALL MEN TALKED FREELY TO ALL MEN IN THE STREETS
6019-3185-0012_1553-140047-0024 DOORS OPEN THAT SHOULD BE SHUT OR UNLOCKED THAT SHOULD BE TRIPLY SECURED THE VERY WALLS GONE BARRIERS SWALLOWED UP BY UNKNOWN ABYSSES NOTHING AROUND ONE BUT FRAIL CURTAINS AND A WORLD OF ILLIMITABLE NIGHT
6019-3185-0017_2436-2476-0022 A NOBLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE DIPLOMACY OF RUSSIA FROM WHICH I QUOTE AN EXTRACT I WISH IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTIONS AND IN TERMS STRONGER THAN I KNOW HOW TO DEVISE
6019-3185-0018_8063-274117-0027 A YOUNG MAN ON WHOSE BEHALF THE CZAR HIMSELF IS PRIVATELY KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE VERY STRONGEST INTEREST HE WAS AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AS AN AIDE DE CAMP TO A DUTCH GENERAL OFFICER AND IS DECORATED WITH DISTINCTIONS WON UPON THAT AWFUL DAY
6019-3185-0019_2136-5140-0001 HOWEVER THOUGH SERVING IN THAT INSTANCE UNDER ENGLISH ORDERS AND ALTHOUGH AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ENGLISH MILITARY SERVICE HE HAS SERVED YOUNG AS HE IS
6019-3185-0022_1841-179183-0018 AS I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE SLOW TO DISCOVER BUT HIS LONG MILITARY SERVICE AND THE UNPARALLELED TUMULT OF OUR EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE EIGHTEEN O FIVE HAVE INTERFERED AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE WITH THE CULTIVATION OF HIS MIND
6019-3185-0023_7178-34644-0067 FOR HE ENTERED THE CAVALRY SERVICE OF A GERMAN POWER WHEN A MERE BOY AND SHIFTED ABOUT FROM SERVICE TO SERVICE AS THE HURRICANE OF WAR BLEW FROM THIS POINT OR FROM THAT
6019-3185-0024_911-128684-0019 AND TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HAVING CONTRIBUTED YOUR PART TO THE FORMATION OF ONE WHOM ALL HERE AT SAINT PETERSBURG NOT SOLDIERS ONLY BUT WE DIPLOMATES LOOK UPON AS CERTAIN TO PROVE A GREAT MAN
6019-3185-0025_6181-216552-0085 HE WAS TO KEEP A TABLE AND AN ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS AT HIS OWN COST WAS TO HAVE AN APARTMENT OF SOME DOZEN OR SO OF ROOMS THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF THE LIBRARY WITH SOME OTHER PUBLIC PRIVILEGES WILLINGLY CONCEDED BY THE MAGISTRACY OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0026_1081-125237-0014 THAT ALL WAS CLOSED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WHEN ONCE THAT CONSUMMATION WAS ATTAINED I THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BREATHED NO SYLLABLE OF WHAT WAS STIRRING NOW GAVE LOOSE TO THE INTERESTING TIDINGS AND SUFFERED THEM TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0027_332-128985-0009 IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT SUCH A STORY ALREADY ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN ITS FIRST OUTLINE WOULD LOSE NOTHING IN THE TELLING AN ENGLISHMAN TO BEGIN WITH WHICH NAME OF ITSELF AND AT ALL TIMES IS A PASSPORT INTO GERMAN FAVOR
6019-3185-0029_5750-100289-0019 THEN A SOLDIER COVERED WITH BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS AND IN THE MOST BRILLIANT ARM OF THE SERVICE YOUNG MOREOVER AND YET A VETERAN BY HIS EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM THE MOST AWFUL BATTLE OF THIS PLANET SINCE THE DAY OF PHARSALIA
6019-3185-0033_5104-33406-0006 WHICH IS THUS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AND WITHOUT LIMITATION IS TRUE ONLY CONDITIONALLY IT IS TRUE THEN AND THERE ONLY WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE MERIT TO SUSTAIN AND JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION BUT IN ANY CASE WHERE THE MERIT IS TRANSCENDENT OF ITS KIND
6019-3185-0037_3259-158083-0122 WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ALIGHTED FROM THE CLOUDS BEFORE ME POWER AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF POWER IN ANY ABSOLUTE INCARNATION OF GRANDEUR OR EXCESS
6019-3185-0038_587-41611-0021 UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
6019-3185-0039_1081-125237-0070 WERE TOO EMINENT TO ALLOW OF HIS BEING TREATED WITH LESS THAN THE HIGHEST ATTENTION IN ANY SOCIETY WHATEVER BUT THE EFFECT OF THESE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES ENFORCED AND RECOMMENDED AS THEY WERE BY A PERSONAL BEAUTY SO RARE
6019-3185-0042_2007-149877-0011 UNLESS WHEN IT WAS REVIVED BY STRENGTH OF FRIENDSHIP OR OF LOVE THE EFFECT WAS AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING TO ALL PARTIES EVERY VOICE PAUSED OR FALTERED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM DEAD SILENCE ENSUED
6019-3185-0046_1355-39947-0084 NEVER WAS THERE SO VICTORIOUS A CONQUEST INTERCHANGED BETWEEN TWO YOUTHFUL HEARTS NEVER BEFORE SUCH A RAPTURE OF INSTANTANEOUS SYMPATHY I DID NOT WITNESS THE FIRST MEETING OF THIS MYSTERIOUS MAXIMILIAN AND THIS MAGNIFICENT MARGARET
6019-3185-0047_7402-90848-0005 AND DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MARGARET MANIFESTED THAT TREPIDATION AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH DISTRESSED SO MANY OF HER YOUTHFUL CO RIVALS BUT IF SHE DID IT MUST HAVE FLED BEFORE THE FIRST GLANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S EYE WHICH WOULD INTERPRET PAST ALL MISUNDERSTANDING
6019-3185-0051_2416-152139-0014 WHO HAD DIED IN GIVING BIRTH TO THIS THIRD CHILD THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD LONG SURVIVED HER ANXIOUS THAT HIS SON SHOULD GO THROUGH A REGULAR COURSE OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUCTION NOW BECOMING ANNUALLY MORE IMPORTANT IN ALL THE ARTILLERY SERVICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE
6019-3185-0052_2007-149877-0035 AND THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE A TINCTURE OF OTHER LIBERAL STUDIES WHICH HE HAD PAINFULLY MISSED IN HIS OWN MILITARY CAREER THE BARON CHOSE TO KEEP HIS SON FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AT OUR COLLEGE UNTIL HE WAS NOW ENTERING UPON HIS TWENTY THIRD YEAR
6019-3185-0054_7059-77897-0027 NOT DAZZLING BUT RESPECTABLE AND SO AMIABLE WERE HIS TEMPER AND MANNERS THAT I HAD INTRODUCED HIM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE HE WAS A FAVORITE AND EVERYWHERE INDEED EXCEPT EXACTLY THERE WHERE ONLY IN THIS WORLD HE CARED FOR FAVOR
6019-3185-0055_6454-93938-0016 SHE IT WAS WHOM HE LOVED AND HAD LOVED FOR YEARS WITH THE WHOLE ARDOR OF HIS ARDENT SOUL SHE IT WAS FOR WHOM OR AT WHOSE COMMAND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DIED EARLY HE HAD FELT THAT IN HER HANDS LAY HIS DESTINY
6019-3185-0056_1867-148436-0043 THAT SHE IT WAS WHO MUST BE HIS GOOD OR HIS EVIL GENIUS AT FIRST AND PERHAPS TO THE LAST I PITIED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BUT MY PITY SOON CEASED TO BE MINGLED WITH RESPECT
6019-3185-0057_4640-19187-0028 AND THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR HIM AS I SAID OFTEN WAS TO QUIT THE CITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE PURSUITS OF ENTERPRISE OF AMBITION OR OF SCIENCE BUT HE HEARD ME AS A SOMNAMBULIST MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
6019-3185-0058_669-129061-0004 STARTING FEARFUL AGITATED SOMETIMES HE BROKE OUT INTO MANIACAL MOVEMENTS OF WRATH INVOKING SOME ABSENT PERSON PRAYING BESEECHING MENACING SOME AIR WOVE PHANTOM
6019-3185-0061_405-130894-0030 THE OLD MAN SIGHED AND DESISTED THEN CAME BUT ENOUGH FROM PITY FROM SYMPATHY FROM COUNSEL AND FROM CONSOLATION AND FROM SCORN
6019-3185-0063_2384-152900-0085 FOR THE COSTLINESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF OFFICIAL PRIDE DONE IN HONOR OF THE CITY NOT AS AN EFFORT OF PERSONAL DISPLAY IT FOLLOWED FROM THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THESE HALF YEARLY DANCES ORIGINATED
6019-3185-0079_5789-57158-0021 WHAT WAS TRUE THAT HER UNCLE MISTER WEISHAUPT'S FAMILY HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT NOT ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN SPARED NAMELY MISTER WEISHAUPT HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE NEITHER OF THEM MUCH ABOVE SIXTY
6019-3185-0080_4051-11218-0043 BUT BOTH INFIRM BEYOND THEIR YEARS TWO MAIDEN SISTERS OF MISTER WEISHAUPT FROM FORTY TO FORTY SIX YEARS OF AGE AND AN ELDERLY FEMALE DOMESTIC
6019-3185-0081_6147-34605-0020 AN INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING THE RECITAL OF THESE HORRORS AND OF THE DETAILS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT FURNISHED MATTER FOR CONVERSATION EVEN IN THESE HOURS WHEN SO THRILLING AN INTEREST HAD POSSESSION OF ALL MINDS MANY LADIES FAINTED AMONG THEM
6019-3185-0082_1898-145715-0005 AND SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE GROUND BUT FOR MAXIMILIAN WHO SPRANG FORWARD AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS SHE WAS LONG OF RETURNING TO HERSELF AND DURING THE AGONY OF HIS SUSPENSE HE STOOPED AND KISSED HER PALLID LIPS
6019-3185-0088_226-122538-0026 WERE MARKED BY THE COOLEST NAY THE MOST SNEERING INDIFFERENCE THE FIRST THING HE DID ON BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST HIMSELF WAS TO LAUGH FEROCIOUSLY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE MOST CORDIALLY AND UNAFFECTEDLY
6019-3185-0089_374-180299-0022 GOLD REPEATERS MASSY PLATE GOLD SNUFF BOXES UNTOUCHED THAT ARGUMENT CERTAINLY WEIGHED MUCH IN HIS FAVOR AND YET AGAIN IT WAS TURNED AGAINST HIM FOR A MAGISTRATE ASKED HIM HOW HE HAPPENED TO KNOW ALREADY THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TOUCHED
6019-3185-0093_8629-261139-0025 FOR THERE WITH ONE ARM STILL WREATHED ABOUT THE ALTAR FOOT THOUGH IN HER AGONY SHE HAD TURNED ROUND UPON HER FACE DID THE ELDER SISTER LIE WHEN THE MAGISTRATES FIRST BROKE OPEN THE STREET DOOR AND UPON THE BEAUTIFUL PARQUET
6019-3185-0094_2843-152918-0100 OR INLAID FLOOR WHICH RAN ROUND THE ROOM WERE STILL IMPRESSED THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MURDERER THESE IT WAS HOPED MIGHT FURNISH A CLEW TO THE DISCOVERY OF ONE AT LEAST AMONG THE MURDEROUS BAND THEY WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO TRACE ACCURATELY
6019-3185-0095_2092-145706-0049 THOSE PARTS OF THE TRACES WHICH LAY UPON THE BLACK TESSELLAE BEING LESS DISTINCT IN THE OUTLINE THAN THE OTHERS UPON THE WHITE OR COLORED MOST UNQUESTIONABLY SO FAR AS THIS WENT IT FURNISHED A NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THE NEGRO
6019-3185-0096_40-121026-0010 FOR THE FOOTSTEPS WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUTLINE FROM HIS AND SMALLER FOR AARON WAS A MAN OF COLOSSAL BUILD
6019-3185-0097_8580-287364-0025 AND AS TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES HAD BEEN FOUND AND HIS HAVING SO FAMILIARLY RELIED UPON THE FACT OF NO ROBBERY HAVING TAKEN PLACE AS AN ARGUMENT ON HIS OWN BEHALF
6019-3185-0098_3699-19402-0000 HE CONTENDED THAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN AMONG THE CROWD THAT PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE ALONG WITH THE MAGISTRATES THAT FROM HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOMS AND THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION
6019-3185-0100_4853-27670-0022 IN SIX WEEKS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF THIS TERRIFIC EVENT THE NEGRO WAS SET AT LIBERTY BY A MAJORITY OF VOICES AMONG THE MAGISTRATES IN THAT SHORT INTERVAL OTHER EVENTS HAD OCCURRED NO LESS TERRIFIC AND MYSTERIOUS
6019-3185-0102_7859-102519-0054 IN SAD LEISURELY OR IN TERRIFIC GROUPS SEEMED TO ARGUE A LETHARGY LIKE THAT OF APOPLEXY IN THE VICTIMS ONE AND ALL THE VERY MIDNIGHT OF MYSTERIOUS AWE FELL UPON ALL MINDS
6019-3185-0104_6476-57446-0008 ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
6019-3185-0107_4297-13009-0064 HAD THESE VERY MURDERERS ADDED TO THEIR FUNCTIONS THOSE OF ROBBERY THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME LESS TERRIFIC
6019-3185-0108_5463-39174-0008 FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
6019-3185-0109_6476-57446-0066 NO MAN COULD GUESS WHAT IT WAS THAT MUST MAKE HIM OBNOXIOUS TO THE MURDERERS IMAGINATION EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN VAIN GUESSES AT THE CAUSES WHICH COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE MADE THE POOR WEISHAUPTS OBJECTS OF SUCH HATRED TO ANY MAN
6064-300880-0000_8088-284756-0021 FIVE TIMES MISTER THOMAS HARMON VAINLY RANG THE BELL OF THE REMSEN MANSION WHILE ENGAGED UPON THE SIXTH VARIATION HE BECAME AWARE OF A FACE IN THE WINDOW SCRUTINIZING HIM ALL RIGHT CALLED THE FACE
6064-300880-0002_8123-275209-0014 NOT YET CARE TO TRY WHAT DOES THE THING LOOK LIKE CAST YOUR EYES TOWARD THE AVENUE AND YOU'LL SEE ONE
6064-300880-0003_2764-36617-0031 HE NEVER ASKS QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S TROUBLES HE NOW BUSIED HIMSELF IN THOUGHT HAVEN'T YOU ANY OF YOUR AMATEUR THEATRICAL DUDS HERE WAS THE OUTCOME OF HIS COGITATIONS ALL OF'EM
6064-300880-0009_2836-5355-0008 TESTED IT AT EVERY POINT AND PRONOUNCED IT PERFECT BUT WE'VE FORGOTTEN ONE POINT SAID REMSEN AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION WHAT'S THAT WHERE DO I GO WHEN I GET OUT WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO

6064-300880-0027_8063-274115-0036 FROM ITS WINDOW EMERGED A HEAVY PUFF OF SMOKE FROM ITS DOOR EMERGED MISTER THOMAS HARMON WHO ROLLED UPON THE PAVEMENT APPARENTLY STRANGLING MISTER MURPHY RUSHED TO HIS AID
6064-300880-0029_2843-152918-0096 AND LEISURELY CLIMBED THEM AGAIN WAS WRENCHING VIOLENTLY AT THE BELL FOR A TIME MISTER MURPHY REGARDED HIM DISDAINFULLY THEN CROSSED OVER HELD BRIEF COLLOQUY AND RETURNED HOT CHANCE HE'S GOT OF BREAKING IN

6064-300880-0032_8468-286673-0030 IT WAS DONE ALMOST AS WELL AS THAT ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR MISTER JACOB REMSEN COULD HAVE DONE IT HARMON SPRANG ACROSS THE STREET

6064-300880-0035_6272-70191-0030 DECIDED THE CALLER ARGUMENT FOLLOWED WHILE THE CHAUFFEUR BURROWED INTO THE MECHANISM OF HIS CAR IT ENDED BY THE ENGLISHMAN BESTOWING TWO DOLLARS UPON MISTER MURPHY TO GET A MESSAGE TO MISTER REMSEN CONTAINING A PROTEST AND AN ADDRESS
6064-300880-0036_322-124147-0058 THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEN MOVED AWAY IN THE EXTINGUISHED TAXI TICKETS HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY THE FORETHOUGHTFUL HARMON THE FUGITIVE WAS THE FIRST MAN IN THE PARLOR CAR
6064-300880-0038_4051-11218-0041 THE ELUDER OF JUSTICE EYED THEM AND DREW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS HERE WE ARE ALL OF US HE SAID TO HIMSELF RETIRING DISCREETLY BEHIND HIS NEWSPAPER
6064-56165-0001_196-122159-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
6064-56165-0002_696-93314-0021 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0003_5322-7680-0028 AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
6064-56165-0004_5456-24741-0009 I WASN'T SORRY FOR THE NEW YORK SET IS GETTING JUST UNBEARABLE I WOULDN'T SO MUCH MIND FIGHTING STANLEY HOOPER MYSELF ABOUT NEW YORK AND BOSTON I GUESS I'D SHOW HIM THAT NEW YORK ISN'T THE WHOLE WORLD

6064-56165-0010_5049-25947-0013 PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
6064-56165-0011_4018-107312-0019 THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP

6064-56165-0032_7302-86814-0012 AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
6064-56165-0034_2843-152918-0059 HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
6064-56168-0003_332-128985-0016 THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
6064-56168-0004_8838-298545-0038 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
6064-56168-0005_1235-135883-0049 AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
6064-56168-0008_2159-179154-0037 EXCEPT THAT YOU SPEAK AS IF IT WERE SOME ONE WE MIGHT NOT CARE TO HAVE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD SAID BELLE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT BROKE IN BRENDA RATHER SNAPPISHLY I WILL JUST TELL EDITH WHAT I THINK
6064-56168-0010_2764-36619-0015 YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
6064-56168-0011_328-129766-0019 IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE JULIA TAGGING ABOUT EVERYWHERE BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD HAVE RUTH ROBERTS WHEN WE NEVER SEE HER ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT SCHOOL I REALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU AND NORA CAN LIKE IT EITHER WHY
6064-56168-0012_3807-4955-0036 RUTH ROBERTS IS AS PLEASANT A GIRL AS THERE IS IN SCHOOL AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLY LONELY TIME IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDITH AND JULIA NOBODY ELSE EVER THINKS OF SPEAKING TO HER WELL WHY SHOULD WE
6064-56168-0013_6209-34599-0032 YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
6064-56168-0015_1553-140048-0004 BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
6064-56168-0019_1926-147987-0031 I SHOULD CALL IT VERY IMPOLITE IF THERE WERE NO ORANGE FLAGS SHOWN AT THE GAME WELL YOU HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUS IDEAS HASN'T SHE BRENDA BRENDA NODDED ASSENT AND NORA CONTINUED
6064-56168-0021_5390-24512-0037 OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
6064-56168-0022_163-122947-0024 WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
6064-56168-0023_2289-152258-0002 RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
6064-56168-0024_6563-285357-0022 THAT THEY WERE VERY SELFISH IN LEAVING THEIR SCHOOLMATE SO ENTIRELY TO HERSELF IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE HER THEY WERE MERELY SO VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THAT THEY HARDLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS OFTEN LEFT TO HERSELF
6064-56168-0026_887-123291-0003 AND WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE IN JOINING THEM NO ONE GETS A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT FROM READING A SINGLE CHAPTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOOK AND SO IT IS OFTEN HARD TO BE A MERE LISTENER
6064-56168-0029_125-121124-0060 HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE AND IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DELIGHT TO HER TO HAVE THE LATTER PLACED WITH HER IN ONE OR TWO SPECIAL CLASSES JULIA'S LIKING FOR HER HAD MADE EDITH TAKE A LITTLE MORE INTEREST IN HER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
6064-56168-0031_4195-186237-0002 WAS SO ANNOYED BY BELLE'S PROPOSED CHAMPIONSHIP OF PRINCETON THAT SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CORDIAL TO RUTH AND ALMOST TO HER OWN SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF URGING RUTH TO COME TO TOWN EARLY ON THE SATURDAY OF THE GAME TO TAKE LUNCHEON WITH HER AND JULIA
6064-56168-0032_6818-76332-0002 THE LATTER EXPRESSED HER THANKS IN A GLANCE TOWARDS HER COUSIN AS RUTH ACCEPTED VERY GRACEFULLY AND NORA EXCLAIMED WHAT FUN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
6078-54007-0000_6209-34600-0031 ILL LUCK AND THE FIDDLER ONCE UPON A TIME SAINT NICHOLAS CAME DOWN INTO THE WORLD TO TAKE A PEEP AT THE OLD PLACE AND SEE HOW THINGS LOOKED IN THE SPRING TIME ON HE STEPPED ALONG THE ROAD TO THE TOWN WHERE HE USED TO LIVE

6078-54007-0014_3830-12535-0029 ALL BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE WITH A FOUNTAIN IN FRONT AND PEACOCKS STRUTTING ABOUT ON THE LAWN WELL THE FIDDLER SMOOTHED DOWN HIS HAIR AND BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES A BIT AND OFF HE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN AT THE GRAND HOUSE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
6078-54007-0015_458-126305-0005 HE ENTERED THE DOOR AND NOBODY SAID NO TO HIM THEN HE PASSED THROUGH ONE ROOM AFTER ANOTHER AND EACH WAS FINER THAN THE ONE HE LEFT BEHIND MANY SERVANTS STOOD AROUND BUT THEY ONLY BOWED AND NEVER ASKED WHENCE HE CAME
6078-54007-0016_6019-3185-0048 THE TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH A FEAST THAT SMELLED SO GOOD THAT IT BROUGHT TEARS TO THE FIDDLER'S EYES AND WATER TO HIS MOUTH AND ALL THE PLATES WERE OF PURE GOLD THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAT ALONE BUT ANOTHER PLACE WAS SPREAD
6078-54007-0019_3440-171009-0081 AND WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILD AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE FIRST BODY THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE I WOULD TAKE FOR A SON OR A DAUGHTER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE YOU ARE THE FIRST
6078-54007-0025_2136-5147-0026 THERE IN A CORNER BY THE WALL WAS A GREAT TRAP DOOR OF IRON THE OLD MAN FITTED THE KEY TO THE LOCK AND TURNED IT HE LIFTED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT DOWN A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND THE FIDDLER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
6078-54007-0030_3374-298026-0038 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
6078-54007-0031_32-4137-0012 HE HEARD A SOUND LIKE THE WAVES BEATING ON THE SHORE WELL SAYS HE THIS IS THE MOST CURIOUS THING I HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE COME SO FAR I MAY AS WELL SEE THE END OF IT
6078-54007-0032_445-123857-0026 SO HE ENTERED THE PASSAGEWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT ON AND ON AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT KEPT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AND BY AND BY POP OUT HE CAME AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE SURE ENOUGH
6078-54007-0033_4088-158079-0011 THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
6078-54007-0035_8123-275209-0032 UNTIL THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GARDEN AND THERE ILL LUCK LET THE FIDDLER DROP SWASH DOWN HE FELL INTO THE TOP OF AN APPLE TREE AND THERE HE HUNG IN THE BRANCHES IT WAS THE GARDEN OF A ROYAL CASTLE
6078-54007-0041_2952-407-0022 YOU MUST NOT ASK OR WISH TO KNOW SHOULD YOU OPEN THAT DOOR ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU POOH SAID THE FIDDLER I DON'T CARE TO KNOW ANYHOW AND OFF THEY WENT HAND IN HAND YES
6078-54007-0045_1455-134435-0032 AND LISTEN AND SO HE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WELL HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL POP THERE HE WAS OUT AT THE FARTHER END AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD STEPPED OUT UPON THE SEA SHORE
6078-54007-0048_6385-34655-0018 OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
6078-54007-0049_1578-6379-0010 I KNOW NOT WHY IT IS SAID HE BUT THAT STORY OF YOURS MY FRIEND BRINGS TO MY MIND A STORY OF A MAN WHOM I ONCE KNEW A GREAT MAGICIAN IN HIS TIME AND A NECROMANCER AND A CHEMIST AND AN ALCHEMIST
6078-54007-0050_1116-137572-0024 AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI

6078-54013-0000_1743-142914-0002 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A SERVANT WHO SERVED A WISE MAN
6078-54013-0003_4195-186238-0021 YOU HAVE SERVED ME FAITHFULLY THESE SEVEN YEARS GONE AND NOW THAT YOU ASK LEAVE TO GO YOU SHALL GO BUT IT IS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MONEY THAT I CAN GIVE YOU AND SO YOU WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT I CAN AFFORD
6078-54013-0006_6476-57446-0017 AND IT IS JUST IN SUCH AN UNLIKELY PLACE AS THIS THAT A MAN'S BEST CHANCE OF FORTUNE COMES TO HIM SOMETIMES AS THE SERVANT SAT THERE THERE CAME TWO RAVENS FLYING AND LIT UPON THE CROSS BEAM OVERHEAD
6078-54013-0007_7178-34644-0004 THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0012_6848-252323-0003 AND WISH AND WHATEVER ONE ASKS FOR ONE SHALL HAVE YOU MAY GUESS THAT WHEN THE SERVANT UNDERSTOOD THE TALK OF THE RAVENS HE WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING USE OF WHAT HE HEARD UP HE SCRAMBLED
6078-54013-0014_302-123523-0025 THERE IS ONE CONDITION YOU MUST FULFIL MANY STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN UPON OUR JOURNEY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
6078-54013-0018_5867-48852-0107 THERE THE TRAVELLING COMPANION STOPPED AND DRAWING OUT A LITTLE PIPE FROM UNDER HIS JACKET

6078-54013-0023_1455-138263-0036 THEN THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN THEY NODDED UNTIL ALL WERE AS DUMB AS LOGS AND AS SOUND ASLEEP AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER WAKEN AGAIN ONLY THE SERVANT AND THE PIPER STAYED AWAKE FOR THE MUSIC DID NOT MAKE THEM DROWSY AS IT DID THE REST
6078-54013-0024_3830-12535-0002 THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
6078-54013-0029_6529-62554-0039 HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
6078-54013-0030_6209-34600-0024 UP STEPPED THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR RAP TAP TAP BY AND BY IT WAS OPENED A CRACK AND THERE STOOD AN UGLY OLD WOMAN BLEAR EYED AND CROOKED AND GNARLED AS A WINTER TWIG

6078-54013-0036_2911-7601-0019 THEN HE LED THE WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IF THE SERVING MAN HAD WONDERED THE DAY BEFORE AT THAT WHICH THE COMRADE DID HE WONDERED TEN TIMES MORE TO SEE HIM GIVE SO BEAUTIFUL A RING
6078-54013-0037_5678-43303-0037 THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
6078-54013-0041_6064-56165-0031 FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS

6078-54013-0068_6531-61334-0001 AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND SET HIM BESIDE HIMSELF AT THE TABLE

6081-41997-0009_460-172357-0008 WHEN I SAW TWO WOMEN STANDING UNDER A LAMP SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF I DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM FOR WHEN A MAN IS AS OLD AS I AM WOMEN GO ON SAID LECOQ WHO COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE

6081-41997-0038_4297-13009-0063 HOWEVER HE BOWED CIVILLY TO THE CONCIERGE WHOM HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE NEED OF AT ANOTHER TIME AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE CAB AS I HAD SUPPOSED THEY DO NOT LIVE HERE HE REMARKED TO THE DRIVER
6081-41998-0000_7078-271888-0067 WHEN A MYSTERIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED OR A GREAT CATASTROPHE HAS HAPPENED AND THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED A GREAT DAY INVARIABLY FOLLOWS AT THE MORGUE
6081-41998-0002_730-359-0050 EXCHANGING JESTS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL'S FLESH CREEP AS A RULE THEY ARE FAR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CORPSES LAID OUT FOR PUBLIC VIEW ON THE MARBLE SLABS IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL
6081-41998-0003_7148-82991-0028 AS THE VEHICLE CONVEYING LECOQ REACHED THE QUAY
6081-41998-0004_200-126784-0001 THE NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED THE TRAGEDY AT THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S DRINKING DEN OF COURSE MORE OR LESS CORRECTLY AND EVERYBODY WISHED TO SEE THE VICTIMS

6081-41998-0013_6437-66173-0016 ACCORDINGLY LECOQ MADE A GESTURE OF ASSENT AND THEN HURRIED TOWARD THE MORGUE IF THERE WAS A CROWD ON THE ROADWAY OUTSIDE IT WAS BECAUSE THE GLOOMY BUILDING ITSELF WAS CRAMMED FULL OF PEOPLE INDEED THE SIGHTSEERS
6081-41998-0018_7312-92432-0023 MAY COME NO FURTHER THAN THE DOOR BUT THE OTHERS ENTER AND AFTER A LONG STARE RETURN AND RECOUNT THEIR IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR LESS COURAGEOUS COMPANIONS IF THERE SHOULD BE NO CORPSE EXHIBITED
6081-41998-0020_1898-145715-0050 FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MURDERER WHOSE IDENTITY LECOQ WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH HAD FURNISHED THREE VICTIMS FOR THEIR DELECTATION
6081-41998-0021_7302-86814-0043 AND YET A DAMP CHILL CAME FROM BEYOND THE IRON RAILINGS WHILE FROM THE CROWD ITSELF ROSE AN INFECTIOUS VAPOR IMPREGNATED WITH THE STENCH OF THE CHLORIDE OF LIME USED AS A DISINFECTANT
6081-41998-0022_1737-148989-0023 AS A CONTINUOUS ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE EXCLAMATIONS SIGHS AND WHISPERED COMMENTS OF THE BYSTANDERS CAME THE MURMUR OF THE WATER TRICKLING FROM A SPIGOT AT THE HEAD OF EACH SLAB A TINY STREAM THAT FLOWED FORTH
6081-41998-0023_1263-141777-0032 ONLY TO FALL IN FINE SPRAY UPON THE MARBLE THROUGH THE SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS A GRAY LIGHT STOLE IN ON THE EXPOSED BODIES BRINGING EACH MUSCLE INTO BOLD RELIEF
6081-41998-0024_3879-174923-0015 REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
6081-41998-0025_696-93314-0035 FOR NOTHING IS WASTED AT THE MORGUE HOWEVER LECOQ WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO REMARK THE HORRORS OF THE SCENE HE SCARCELY BESTOWED A GLANCE ON THE THREE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0027_8629-261139-0041 UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF HIS COMRADE'S ABSENCE LECOQ ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEAD KEEPER IT WOULD SEEM THAT NO ONE HAS RECOGNIZED THE VICTIMS HE REMARKED NO ONE AND YET
6081-41998-0028_7264-92316-0022 EVER SINCE OPENING WE HAVE HAD AN IMMENSE CROWD IF I WERE MASTER HERE ON DAYS LIKE THIS I WOULD CHARGE AN ADMISSION FEE OF TWO SOUS A HEAD

6081-41998-0034_6880-216547-0040 SUDDENLY I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS SHIRT AND CALLING THE ATTENTION OF HIS COMPANIONS TO ONE OF THE UNKNOWN VICTIMS HE WHISPERED GUSTAVE
6081-41998-0036_5778-12761-0002 BUT THE PERSON WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN WAS SO OVERCOME THAT HE COULD SCARCELY DRAG HIMSELF ALONG AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE HIM TO A LITTLE RESTAURANT CLOSE BY I ENTERED IT MYSELF AND IT IS THERE I WRITE THIS LETTER
6081-41998-0037_5456-62043-0038 IN THE MEAN TIME WATCHING THEM OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEND THIS NOTE EXPLAINING MY ABSENCE TO THE HEAD KEEPER WHO WILL GIVE IT YOU YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GOING TO FOLLOW THESE MEN A B

6081-41998-0042_4397-15678-0037 WHEN FINDING A DOORKEEPER INSTALLED BEHIND A HEAVY OAKEN DESK HE REMARKED
6081-41998-0043_3983-5371-0028 THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD NO SAID HE
6081-42010-0001_8226-274369-0062 AND DEPENDENT ON THE CUSTOMERS IT BROUGHT THEM BEING OF A CONSCIENTIOUS TURN OF MIND HE ENTERED EACH ESTABLISHMENT IN SUCCESSION AND MEETING NOW AND AGAIN VARIOUS ACQUAINTANCES HE FELT COMPELLED TO PROFFER AND ACCEPT
6081-42010-0002_6476-57446-0074 NUMEROUS GLASSES OF THE FAVORITE MORNING BEVERAGE WHITE WINE TURN WHICH WAY HE WOULD HOWEVER LOITER AS LONG AS HE MIGHT
6081-42010-0003_5192-19396-0002 HE WAS RETURNING IN HASTE A TRIFLE UNEASY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF HIS ABSENCE WHEN HE PERCEIVED A CAB PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE PALAIS GATEWAY A SECOND GLANCE AND OH GREAT GOOD FORTUNE HE SAW LECOQ
6081-42010-0005_2007-149877-0028 THAT HE DELIVERED THE ORDER FOR LECOQ TO FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT A MINUTE'S DELAY
6081-42010-0008_2196-174172-0038 AND YET FATE SO WILLED IT THAT THE DOORKEEPER'S MESSAGE AND HIS URGENT APPEAL THAT LECOQ SHOULD NOT LOITER ON THE WAY PRODUCED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE RESULTS
6081-42010-0009_8629-261140-0016 WHEN HE SAW HOWEVER THAT THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT ALONE AND WHEN HE RECOGNIZED POLYTE CHUPIN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
6081-42010-0010_332-128985-0053 HE INSTANTLY PERCEIVED HIS MISTAKE AND UNDERSTOOD ITS CONSEQUENCES THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE HE MUST PREVENT ANY EXCHANGE OF WORDS BETWEEN THE TWO
6081-42010-0015_27-124992-0043 AH AH THOUGHT THE SMILING CLERK IN A FLUTTER OF DELIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW BUT AS THESE LITTLE DIVERSIONS NEVER MADE HIM FORGET HIS DUTIES HE LEANED TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE AND ASKED
6081-42010-0018_4406-16883-0019 YET OBTAINING THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED LET US PROCEED HE SAID TO POLYTE WHO HAD NOT MOVED SINCE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE ROOM
6081-42010-0022_2002-139469-0112 READ THE LAST REMARK YOU TOOK DOWN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE THE SMILING CLERK REPEATED I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL THE PERSON WHO DARED TO SAY THAT I KNEW LACHENEUR

6081-42010-0029_229-130880-0001 AND TO TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION TO PREVENT HIM SEEING HIS WIFE AGAIN WHEN POLYTE HAD DEPARTED LECOQ REENTERED THE ROOM
6081-42010-0030_87-121553-0026 BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME AND MADE HASTE TO BRING HER HERE I THOUGHT I WAS ACTING FOR THE BEST NEVER MIND THE MISFORTUNE CAN BE REPAIRED NO SIR NO SINCE SHE HAS SEEN HER HUSBAND
6081-42010-0031_7067-76047-0035 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0032_4088-158077-0072 AND SHE IS SO TERRIFIED THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF MAKING HER SPEAK
6081-42010-0033_446-123501-0053 AGAIN SET FOOT IN HIS OFFICE THE POOR CREATURE SEEMED NEARLY HEARTBROKEN
6081-42010-0034_445-123860-0013 POLYTE'S THREAT HAD AROUSED THE MOST SINISTER APPREHENSIONS IN HER MIND NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR SHE ASKED HERSELF IF HER TESTIMONY MIGHT NOT PROVE HIS DEATH WARRANT
6081-42010-0035_8419-286667-0010 NO OR I DON'T KNOW AND RETRACTED EVERYTHING SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY STATED TO LECOQ SHE SWORE THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD THAT HER WORDS HAD BEEN MISCONSTRUED
6147-34605-0001_3664-178355-0016 TO HAVE NO TIE UNTIL AS LATE AS POSSIBLE APPEARED TO HIM TO BE A PROLONGATION OF YOUTH MIDDLE AGED YOUNG MEN ABOUNDED IN THOSE RAKISH TIMES THEY GREW GRAY AS YOUNG FOPS THE WIG WAS AN ACCOMPLICE LATER ON POWDER BECAME THE AUXILIARY

6147-34605-0011_27-124992-0067 WHICH SO READILY TURNS TO LOVE JOSIANA WAS NOT NOT THAT SHE WAS UNFEELING THE ANCIENT COMPARISON OF FLESH TO MARBLE IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THE BEAUTY OF FLESH CONSISTS IN NOT BEING MARBLE
6147-34605-0012_8123-275209-0030 ITS BEAUTY IS TO PALPITATE TO TREMBLE TO BLUSH TO BLEED TO HAVE FIRMNESS WITHOUT HARDNESS TO BE WHITE WITHOUT BEING COLD TO HAVE ITS SENSATIONS AND ITS INFIRMITIES ITS BEAUTY IS TO BE LIFE AND MARBLE IS DEATH

6147-34605-0038_3830-12531-0013 SHE WAS A SKIN DEEP PAPIST HER CATHOLICISM DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR FASHION
6147-34606-0001_302-123504-0008 DISGUISED BY ARTFUL CURLING FOR TO RISK ONE'S HAIR WAS ALMOST TO RISK ONE'S HEAD THE INDIGNATION WAS UNIVERSAL NEVERTHELESS

6147-34607-0038_4018-107312-0032 ANNE HAVING THIS INFERIOR BLOOD IN HER VEINS FELT HERSELF BUT HALF ROYAL AND JOSIANA HAVING COME INTO THE WORLD QUITE IRREGULARLY DREW CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE INCORRECTNESS LESS GREAT BUT REALLY EXISTING IN THE BIRTH OF THE QUEEN
6147-34607-0039_2952-407-0009 THE DAUGHTER OF MESALLIANCE LOOKED WITHOUT LOVE UPON THE DAUGHTER OF BASTARDY SO NEAR HER IT WAS AN UNPLEASANT RESEMBLANCE JOSIANA HAD A RIGHT TO SAY TO ANNE MY MOTHER WAS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS YOURS AT COURT NO ONE SAID SO BUT THEY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT
6181-216552-0000_5514-19192-0014 POTHIER SEEMS TO THINK THAT PROPERTY LIKE ROYALTY EXISTS BY DIVINE RIGHT HE TRACES BACK ITS ORIGIN TO GOD HIMSELF
6181-216552-0001_7067-76047-0046 PRINCIPIUM HE BEGINS IN THIS WAY GOD IS THE ABSOLUTE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THAT IT CONTAINS DOMINI
6181-216552-0004_1040-133433-0010 ARE FATHERS UNNATURAL AND CHILDREN PRODIGAL GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE WHY THEN HAVE I RECEIVED NONE HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET
6181-216552-0010_83-9960-0037 THAT THEREAFTER NONE COULD LIVE WITHOUT WORKING IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWED THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF PRODUCTS THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF LABOR AND THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF LABOR
6181-216552-0012_4297-13009-0047 WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
6181-216552-0013_6147-34605-0037 BUT IN WHAT THING EVIDENTLY IN THE PRODUCT NOT IN THE SOIL SO THE ARABS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT AND SO ACCORDING TO CAESAR AND TACITUS THE GERMANS FORMERLY HELD THE ARABS
6181-216552-0015_4195-186236-0009 THE INEQUALITY WHICH RESULTS FROM THE PRETENDED RIGHT OF THE FIRST OCCUPANT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE BASED ON NO PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND WHEN ALL THE LAND FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INHABITANTS
6181-216552-0024_4088-158077-0007 I CAN POSSESS BY SEVERAL TITLES I CAN BECOME PROPRIETOR BY ONLY ONE
6181-216552-0029_8747-293952-0014 IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
6181-216552-0030_2518-154826-0014 HAS SOCIETY RECOGNIZED A RIGHT INJURIOUS TO ITSELF WHERE THERE IS NO PRODUCING CAUSE WHY IN ACCORDING POSSESSION HAS IT ALSO CONCEDED PROPERTY WHY HAS THE LAW SANCTIONED THIS ABUSE OF POWER
6181-216552-0031_2691-156750-0003 SOME PHILOSOPHERS PRETEND THAT MAN IN EMPLOYING HIS FORCES UPON A NATURAL OBJECT SAY A FIELD OR A TREE ACQUIRES A RIGHT ONLY TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE MAKES
6181-216552-0032_587-54108-0030 TO THE FORM WHICH HE GIVES TO THE OBJECT NOT TO THE OBJECT ITSELF USELESS DISTINCTION IF THE FORM COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR QUESTION
6181-216552-0034_3982-182255-0007 VAIN PRETEXT IF THE FORM CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT NOR PROPERTY FROM POSSESSION POSSESSION MUST BE SHARED IN ANY CASE
6181-216552-0037_3607-29116-0002 AND THE THREE THOUSAND FRANCS REQUIRED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS FAMILY THIS PAYMENT IS NOT RENT IT IS AN INDEMNITY WHAT SORT OF JUSTICE IS IT THEN WHICH MAKES SUCH LAWS AS THIS
6181-216552-0038_4640-19187-0029 WHEREAS SINCE LABOR SO CHANGES THE FORM OF A THING THAT THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT DESTROYING THE THING ITSELF EITHER SOCIETY MUST BE DISINHERITED
6181-216552-0043_1867-154075-0006 THE LAW MAKERS ALWAYS DISREGARD THE LATTER AS LONG AS MAN IS OPPOSED TO MAN PROPERTY OFFSETS PROPERTY AND THE TWO FORCES BALANCE EACH OTHER AS SOON AS MAN IS ISOLATED
6181-216552-0046_87-121553-0088 FOR WHO WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PLOUGH AND SOW IF HE WERE NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REAP TO SATISFY THE HUSBANDMAN IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO GUARANTEE HIM POSSESSION OF HIS CROP ADMIT EVEN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
6181-216552-0048_5703-47212-0010 BUT PROPERTY PROPERTY THE RIGHT OF ESCHEAT OVER LANDS WHICH ONE NEITHER OCCUPIES NOR CULTIVATES
6181-216552-0049_7190-90542-0013 WHO PRETENDED TO HAVE IT AGRICULTURE ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT PROPERTY POSITIVE LAWS WERE NEEDED AND MAGISTRATES TO EXECUTE THEM IN A WORD
6181-216552-0050_1334-135589-0042 THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
6181-216552-0054_7780-274562-0105 IT IS THE CIVIL LAW WHICH HOLDS THAT WHEN ONCE ACQUIRED PROPERTY CAN BE LOST ONLY BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR AND THAT IT EXISTS EVEN AFTER THE PROPRIETOR HAS RELINQUISHED POSSESSION OF THE THING
6181-216552-0055_3214-167607-0026 AND IT HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY THUS PROPERTY AND POSSESSION WHICH ORIGINALLY WERE CONFOUNDED BECAME THROUGH THE CIVIL LAW TWO DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT THINGS TWO THINGS WHICH IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW
6181-216552-0057_3440-171009-0016 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATURAL LAW THE APPLICATION OF A MORAL PRINCIPLE IT HAS LITERALLY CREATED A RIGHT OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN PROVINCE IT HAS REALIZED AN ABSTRACTION A METAPHOR
6181-216552-0058_8609-283227-0032 IT HAS INDORSED MONSTROUS PRETENSIONS IT HAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR IMPIOUS VOWS AS IF IT WERE ABLE TO FILL UP A BOTTOMLESS PIT
6181-216552-0059_7190-90542-0079 BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
6181-216552-0065_1183-133256-0006 A MULTITUDE OF RIGHTS SOME FOUNDED IN NATURE BUT WRONGLY INTERPRETED AND STILL MORE WRONGLY APPLIED INHERITANCE GIFT AND EXCHANGE OTHERS LIKE THE PRIVILEGES OF BIRTH AND POSITION
6181-216552-0066_4297-13009-0034 FOR THE BARBARIANS INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN ANNUAL QUARRELS AND FIGHTS INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MOVING THEIR HOUSES FURNITURE AND FAMILIES FROM SPOT TO SPOT THAN TO ASSIGN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL A FIXED AND INALIENABLE ESTATE
6181-216552-0070_405-130894-0064 WHO NEVER HAD THE FAINTEST IDEA OF STATISTICS VALUATION OR POLITICAL ECONOMY FURNISH US WITH PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION THE LAW SAYS A MODERN WRITER ON JURISPRUDENCE
6181-216552-0072_1034-121119-0048 WAS IN THE BEGINNING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF A WANT AND THE INDICATION OF THE MEANS OF SUPPLYING IT AND UP TO THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN NOTHING ELSE THE LEGISTS WITH MECHANICAL FIDELITY
6181-216552-0073_8063-274112-0012 FULL OF OBSTINACY ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY BURIED IN LITERALITIES
6181-216552-0075_3526-176653-0008 EQUITABLE BECAUSE IT WAS COMMON INVOLVES THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SELL GIVE GAIN AND LOSE IT THAT IT TENDS CONSEQUENTLY TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT EQUALITY
6181-216552-0077_7264-92314-0019 THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE INGENUOUS LEGISLATORS THAT IF PROPERTY IS RETAINABLE BY INTENT ALONE NUDO ANIMO
6181-216552-0079_229-130880-0025 WHILE THE BODY IS BUSY ELSEWHERE THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE FATHERS OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE THAT IF THE RIGHT OF INHERITANCE IS ANY THING OTHER THAN NATURE'S METHOD OF PRESERVING EQUALITY OF WEALTH
6181-216552-0080_3374-298025-0011 FAMILIES WILL SOON BECOME VICTIMS OF THE MOST DISASTROUS EXCLUSIONS AND SOCIETY
6181-216552-0082_298-126791-0026 THAT IS THAT INHERITANCE AND SUCCESSION WILL LAST FOR EVER WHOEVER MAY BE THE RECOGNIZED HEIR BUT THE SAINT SIMONIANS WISH THE HEIR TO BE DESIGNATED BY THE MAGISTRATE
6181-216552-0084_1594-135914-0028 TO DAY THE REAL CONTROLLER OF INHERITANCE IS CHANCE OR CAPRICE NOW IN MATTERS OF LEGISLATION CHANCE AND CAPRICE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GUIDES
6181-216552-0088_6081-41997-0028 SIMPLY A MATTER OF RESEARCH AND CURIOSITY IT IS A RULE OF JURISPRUDENCE THAT THE FACT DOES NOT SUBSTANTIATE THE RIGHT NOW PROPERTY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
6181-216552-0089_307-127535-0033 THEN THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY DOES NOT LEGITIMATE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY MAN IS MISTAKEN AS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY THE NATURE OF RIGHT
6181-216552-0091_1867-154075-0011 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS PLACED PROPERTY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS THAT THEY ACCOMPANIED WITH RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES THE WORK OF PARTITIONING THE LAND AND APPRAISING THEIR GOODS
6181-216552-0094_5703-47198-0015 RESTING OF NECESSITY UPON EQUALITY CONTRADICTS ITS PRINCIPLE THE DECISION OF THE RELIGIONS WHICH HAVE SANCTIONED IT IS OF NO EFFECT BECAUSE IN ALL AGES THE PRIEST HAS SUBMITTED TO THE PRINCE
6181-216552-0095_6848-252322-0010 THE SOCIAL ADVANTAGES ATTRIBUTED TO PROPERTY CANNOT BE CITED IN ITS BEHALF BECAUSE THEY ALL SPRING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF POSSESSION WHAT MEANS THEN THIS DITHYRAMB UPON PROPERTY
6181-216552-0096_201-127786-0042 THE SHELTER OF HIS FAMILY IN A WORD THE CORNER STONE OF THE DOMESTIC DWELLING OF COMMUNITIES AND OF THE POLITICAL STATE POSSESSION ALONE PRODUCED ALL THAT
6181-216552-0103_8226-274371-0012 FOR SINCE EVERY MAN FROM THE FACT OF HIS EXISTENCE HAS THE RIGHT OF OCCUPATION AND IN ORDER TO LIVE MUST HAVE MATERIAL FOR CULTIVATION ON WHICH HE MAY LABOR AND SINCE
6181-216552-0106_4788-91208-0027 IN RIGHT CAN NEVER REMAIN FIXED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT THAT IT CAN EVER BECOME PROPERTY EVERY OCCUPANT IS THEN NECESSARILY A POSSESSOR
6181-216552-0108_5456-24741-0024 TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
6181-216552-0109_5390-30096-0012 AN IMMORALITY BORN OF VIOLENCE THE MOST MONSTROUS PRETENSION THAT THE CIVIL LAWS EVER SANCTIONED MAN RECEIVES HIS USUFRUCT FROM THE HANDS OF SOCIETY
6181-216552-0110_5808-48608-0026 WHICH ALONE IS THE PERMANENT POSSESSOR THE INDIVIDUAL PASSES AWAY SOCIETY IS DEATHLESS WHAT A PROFOUND DISGUST FILLS MY SOUL WHILE DISCUSSING SUCH SIMPLE TRUTHS
6181-216552-0111_8324-286681-0023 THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED NOT BY THE WILL BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER PROPERTY CANNOT EXIST
6181-216552-0112_2007-149877-0031 THIS NO CODE HAS EVER EXPRESSED THIS NO CONSTITUTION CAN ADMIT THESE ARE AXIOMS WHICH THE CIVIL LAW AND THE LAW OF NATIONS DENY
6181-216552-0113_4051-11217-0000 BUT I HEAR THE EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PARTISANS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM LABOR LABOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF PROPERTY READER DO NOT BE DECEIVED
6209-34599-0002_83-9960-0051 A WOMAN THE WOMAN IN THE SNOW AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHOM HE WAS CARRYING IN HIS ARMS HE WAS EXHAUSTED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER YET ADVANCED MORE RESOLUTELY THAN EVER WITH LESS STRENGTH AND AN ADDED BURDEN
6209-34599-0007_78-368-0047 THIS WAS PERHAPS THE MOMENT WHEN THE DISTRACTED HOOKER WAS GOING TO PIECES IN THE BATTLE OF THE BREAKERS HE TRAVELLED UNDER THIS NORTH WIND STILL TOWARDS THE EAST OVER WIDE SURFACES OF SNOW HE KNEW NOT HOW THE HOURS HAD PASSED
6209-34599-0008_6064-300880-0033 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD CEASED TO SEE THE SMOKE SUCH INDICATIONS ARE SOON EFFACED IN THE NIGHT BESIDES IT WAS PAST THE HOUR WHEN FIRES ARE PUT OUT OR HE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE
6209-34599-0009_412-126975-0084 DOUBTING HE YET PERSEVERED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE LITTLE INFANT CRIED THEN HE ADOPTED IN HIS GAIT A ROCKING MOVEMENT AND THE CHILD WAS SOOTHED AND SILENCED
6209-34599-0010_1970-28415-0039 SHE ENDED BY FALLING INTO A SOUND SLEEP SHIVERING HIMSELF HE FELT HER WARM
6209-34599-0013_3440-171009-0030 PLAYING ON HIS FACE WARMED IT FOR A MOMENT THEN LINGERED AND FROZE IN HIS HAIR STIFFENING IT INTO ICICLES HE FELT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER DANGER HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO FALL
6209-34599-0014_211-122425-0017 HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID SO HE SHOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN HE WAS OVERCOME BY FATIGUE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS WOULD AS WITH THE DEAD WOMAN HAVE HELD HIM TO THE GROUND AND THE ICE GLUED HIM ALIVE TO THE EARTH
6209-34599-0015_730-359-0034 HE HAD TRIPPED UPON THE SLOPES OF PRECIPICES AND HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF
6209-34599-0018_5678-43302-0035 SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
6209-34599-0019_201-127786-0015 BENDING UNDER HIS BURDEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM THIS LITTLE INFANT WAS THE DROP CAUSING THE CUP OF DISTRESS TO OVERFLOW HE ADVANCED REELING AT EVERY STEP AS IF ON A SPRING BOARD
6209-34599-0021_7190-90542-0008 HE STAGGERED SLIPPED RECOVERED HIMSELF TOOK CARE OF THE INFANT AND GATHERING THE JACKET ABOUT HER HE COVERED UP HER HEAD STAGGERED AGAIN ADVANCED SLIPPED THEN DREW HIMSELF UP THE COWARDLY WIND DROVE AGAINST HIM
6209-34599-0022_332-128985-0086 APPARENTLY HE MADE MUCH MORE WAY THAN WAS NECESSARY HE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE ON THE PLAINS WHERE BINCLEAVES FARM WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WHAT ARE NOW CALLED SPRING GARDENS AND THE PARSONAGE HOUSE
6209-34599-0023_5703-47198-0041 HOMESTEADS AND COTTAGES OCCUPY THE PLACE OF WASTE LANDS SOMETIMES LESS THAN A CENTURY SEPARATES A STEPPE FROM A CITY SUDDENLY A LULL HAVING OCCURRED IN THE ICY BLAST WHICH WAS BLINDING HIM

6209-34599-0028_6000-55211-0030 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LEFT ALL EVIL CHANCES BEHIND HIM
6209-34599-0033_1263-138246-0029 A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
6209-34599-0035_89-219-0006 OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE PAUPER THE BOY DID NOT HESITATE HE APPROACHED THE GREAT MANSION THE DOUBLE FOLDING DOOR OF MASSIVE OAK STUDDED WITH LARGE NAILS WAS OF THE KIND THAT LEADS ONE TO EXPECT
6209-34599-0036_1334-135589-0056 NO ANSWER HE STRUCK AGAIN AND TWO KNOCKS NO MOVEMENT WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED A THIRD TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP AND DID NOT CARE TO GET UP
6209-34600-0001_7190-90542-0045 FOR THE SAME REASON THEY HAD NOT YET DESIGNED ON THE SLOPE OF THE GREEN HILL TOWARDS THE EAST FASHIONED FLAT ON THE SOIL BY CUTTING AWAY THE TURF AND LEAVING THE BARE CHALK TO THE VIEW THE WHITE HORSE AN ACRE LONG
6209-34600-0002_2911-15084-0006 GEORGE THE THIRD HAVING LOST IN HIS OLD AGE THE INTELLECT HE HAD NEVER POSSESSED IN HIS YOUTH WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALAMITIES OF HIS REIGN HE WAS AN INNOCENT WHY NOT ERECT STATUES TO HIM
6209-34600-0005_89-218-0051 AND LEAVING BETWEEN THEM AWKWARD SPACES OF NARROW AND WINDING CHANNELS LANES AND PASSAGES OFTEN FLOODED
6209-34600-0008_6000-86686-0014 HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
6209-34600-0009_4018-103416-0036 THEN MORE CULTIVATED PLOTS THAN DWELLINGS MORE THORN HEDGES THAN HOUSES BUT FORTUNATELY HE STRUCK INTO A PASSAGE WHICH EXISTS TO THIS DAY NEAR TRINITY SCHOOLS THIS PASSAGE LED HIM TO A WATER BRINK

6209-34600-0019_200-124140-0028 EVEN HE WHO SLEEPS NOT FEELS A MEDIUM PRESS UPON HIM FULL OF SINISTER LIFE THE SURROUNDING CHIMERA IN WHICH HE SUSPECTS A REALITY IMPEDES HIM THE WAKING MAN
6209-34600-0023_5867-48852-0080 WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW

6272-70191-0017_1992-141719-0047 IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT

6272-70191-0023_4680-16041-0015 THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
6272-70191-0028_60-121082-0065 WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
6272-70191-0031_4640-19188-0026 AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
6272-70191-0036_87-121553-0000 BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
6367-65536-0001_3486-166424-0071 IT HAD BEEN BY THESE FIRS HE HAD HALTED TWENTY YEARS AGO TURNING FOR ONE LAST GLANCE AT THE VALLEY BELOW THE HOME VALLEY WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN SINCE BUT THEN
6367-65536-0002_4214-7146-0071 THE FIRS HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN VIGOROUS YOUNG SAPLINGS THEY WERE TALL GNARLED TREES NOW WITH LICHENED TRUNKS AND THEIR LOWER BOUGHS WERE DEAD BUT HIGH UP THEIR TOPS WERE GREEN AND CAUGHT THE SAFFRON LIGHT OF THE WEST
6367-65536-0006_118-47824-0025 PITILESS UNSWERVING EAGLE EYES QUICK TO DISCERN AND UNFALTERING TO PURSUE JAW SQUARE AND INTREPID MOUTH FORMED TO KEEP SECRETS AND CAJOLE MEN TO HIS WILL
6367-65536-0007_6529-62556-0037 A FACE THAT HID MUCH AND REVEALED LITTLE IT TOLD OF POWER AND INTELLECT BUT THE SOUL OF THE MAN WAS A HIDDEN THING
6367-65536-0008_1970-10594-0036 NOT IN THE ARENA WHERE HE HAD FOUGHT AND TRIUMPHED GIVING FIERCE BLOW FOR BLOW WAS IT TO BE SHOWN BUT HERE LOOKING DOWN ON THE HOMELAND WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS ABOUT HIM IT ROSE DOMINANTLY AND CLAIMED ITS OWN
6367-65536-0011_7059-77900-0036 THE SACRIFICES HE HAD HEAPED ON THEIR ALTARS AVAILED HIM NOTHING IN THIS NEW NEED AND HUNGER OF HIS BEING HIS GODS MOCKED HIM AND HE WEARIED OF THEIR SERVICE WERE THERE NOT BETTER THINGS THAN THESE
6367-65536-0012_2391-145015-0092 THINGS HE HAD ONCE KNOWN AND LOVED AND FORGOTTEN WHERE WERE THE IDEALS OF HIS YOUTH THE LOFTY ASPIRATIONS THAT HAD UPBORNE HIM THEN WHERE WAS THE EAGERNESS AND ZEST OF NEW DAWNS
6367-65536-0014_8108-274318-0006 WERE THEY YET TO BE HAD FOR THE SEEKING IN THE OLD VALLEY WITH THE THOUGHT CAME A GREAT YEARNING FOR HOME HE HAD HAD MANY HABITATIONS BUT HE REALIZED NOW THAT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY OF THESE PLACES AS HOME
6367-65536-0015_7780-274562-0100 THAT NAME HAD ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BEEN KEPT SACRED TO THE LONG GREEN SEAWARD LOOKING GLEN WHERE HE HAD BEEN BORN SO HE HAD COME BACK TO IT DRAWN BY A LONGING NOT TO BE RESISTED
6367-65536-0018_6454-93938-0027 AND FRIENDS WHOM THE VARYING YEARS MUST CERTAINLY HAVE CHANGED AS HE HAD CHANGED HIMSELF NO HE WOULD NOT GO DOWN IT HAD BEEN A FOOLISH WHIM TO COME AT ALL
6367-65536-0019_3664-178366-0033 FOOLISH BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF HIS QUEST WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE OR ELSEWHERE HE COULD NOT ENTER AGAIN INTO THE HERITAGE OF BOYHOOD AND THE HEART OF YOUTH HE COULD NOT FIND THERE THE OLD DREAMS AND HOPES THAT HAD MADE LIFE SWEET
6367-65536-0023_625-132112-0025 AND THEN HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE DOWN BELOW HIM ON THE CREST OF A LITTLE UPLAND HE SAW HIS OLD HOME A WEATHER GREY HOUSE ALMOST HIDDEN AMONG WHITE BIRCH AND APPLE TREES
6367-65536-0024_1116-137572-0037 WITH A THICK FIR GROVE TO THE NORTH OF IT HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THAT OLD HOUSE HIS EARLIEST MEMORY WAS OF STANDING ON ITS THRESHOLD AND LOOKING AFAR UP TO THE LONG GREEN HILLS WHAT IS OVER THE HILLS HE HAD ASKED OF HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0025_7447-91186-0007 WITH A SMILE SHE HAD MADE ANSWER MANY THINGS LADDIE WONDERFUL THINGS BEAUTIFUL THINGS HEART BREAKING THINGS SOME DAY I SHALL GO OVER THE HILLS AND FIND THEM ALL MOTHER
6367-65536-0026_4051-11217-0021 HE HAD SAID STOUTLY SHE HAD LAUGHED AND SIGHED AND CAUGHT HIM TO HER HEART HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HIS FATHER WHO HAD DIED SOON AFTER HIS SON'S BIRTH BUT HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0027_307-127540-0035 HIS LITTLE BROWN EYED GIRLISH FACED MOTHER HE HAD LIVED ON THE HOMESTEAD UNTIL HE WAS TWENTY HE HAD TILLED THE BROAD FIELDS AND GONE IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE AND THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN HIS LIFE BUT HIS HEART WAS NOT IN HIS WORK
6367-65536-0029_8975-270782-0109 HE SOLD THE FARM TO HIS COUSIN STEPHEN MARSHALL HE SUPPOSED IT STILL BELONGED TO HIM STEPHEN HAD BEEN A GOOD SORT OF A FELLOW A BIT SLOW AND PLODDING PERHAPS BOVINELY CONTENT TO DWELL WITHIN THE HILLS
6367-65536-0031_7505-258958-0029 THE CHILDLESS WIFELESS MAN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE HILL WONDERED IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY PERHAPS SO THERE HAD BEEN JOYCE
6367-65536-0032_6848-76049-0016 NOT SO FAR FROM HIS OWN JUST ACROSS A GREEN MEADOW BY WAY OF A FOOTPATH AND STILE AND THROUGH THE FIRS BEYOND IT HOW OFTEN HE HAD TRAVERSED THAT PATH IN THE OLD DAYS KNOWING THAT JOYCE WOULD BE WAITING AT THE END OF IT AMONG THE FIRS
6367-65536-0034_481-123720-0083 JOYCE ALONE KNEW OF HIS LONGINGS AND HIS AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS HE HAD TOLD THEM ALL TO HER FREELY SURE OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY NO OTHER SOUL IN THE VALLEY COULD GIVE HIM
6367-65536-0035_911-128684-0032 HOW TRUE AND STRONG AND WOMANLY AND GENTLE SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE HAD MEANT TO GO BACK TO HER SOME DAY THEY HAD PARTED WITHOUT PLEDGE OR KISS YET HE KNEW SHE LOVED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED HER
6367-65536-0036_5163-39921-0036 AT FIRST THEY CORRESPONDED THEN THE LETTERS BEGAN TO GROW FEWER IT WAS HIS FAULT HE HAD GRADUALLY FORGOTTEN THE NEW FIERCE BURNING INTERESTS THAT CAME INTO HIS LIFE CROWDED THE OLD ONES OUT
6367-65536-0038_2384-152900-0068 THE OLD PLACES HAD CHANGED LITTLE WHATEVER HE MIGHT FEAR OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THEM THERE WAS THE SCHOOL HE HAD ATTENDED A SMALL LOW EAVED WHITE WASHED BUILDING SET BACK FROM THE MAIN ROAD AMONG GREEN SPRUCES
6367-65536-0039_40-222-0024 BEYOND IT AMID TALL ELMS WAS THE OLD CHURCH WITH ITS SQUARE TOWER HUNG WITH IVY HE FELT GLAD TO SEE IT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A NEW CHURCH
6367-65536-0042_2843-152918-0085 SUDDENLY GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THROUGH AN ARCH OF BLACK FIR BOUGHS A YOUNG MOON SWUNG LOW IN A LAKE OF PALELY TINTED SAFFRON SKY HE SMILED A LITTLE
6367-65536-0045_5104-33407-0004 BUT NO LIGHT GLIMMERED OUT THROUGH HIS NATIVE TREES WHY WAS IT LACKING THAT LIGHT HE HAD SO OFTEN HAILED AT DARK COMING HOME FROM BOYISH RAMBLES ON THE HILLS
6367-65536-0047_6078-54013-0045 EVEN IN THE DIMNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT TO SEE THAT THE OLD HOUSE WAS DESERTED AND FALLING TO DECAY THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG OPEN ON RUSTY HINGES THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND LIFELESS
6367-65536-0048_1594-135914-0079 CUTHBERT MARSHALL SAT DOWN ON THE OLD RED SANDSTONE STEP OF THE DOOR AND BOWED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THIS WAS WHAT HE HAD COME BACK TO THIS GHOST AND WRECK OF HIS PAST OH
6367-65536-0049_3983-5331-0002 STEPHEN CAME TO IT A STOUT GRIZZLED FARMER WITH A CHUBBY BOY ON HIS SHOULDER HE WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED CUTHBERT EASILY RECOGNIZED HIM
6367-65536-0050_7859-102519-0049 CUTHBERT WAS OBLIGED TO TELL WHO HE WAS HE WAS MADE INSTANTLY AND WARMLY WELCOME STEPHEN WAS UNFEIGNEDLY GLAD TO SEE HIM AND STEPHEN'S COMELY WIFE WHOM HE REMEMBERED AS A SLIM FRESH CHEEKED VALLEY GIRL
6367-65536-0052_6078-54013-0073 THIS VALLEY HAD HIS PAST IN ITS KEEPING BUT IT COULD NOT GIVE IT BACK TO HIM HE HAD LOST THE MASTER WORD THAT MIGHT HAVE COMPELLED IT HE ASKED STEPHEN FULLY ABOUT ALL HIS OLD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WITH ONE EXCEPTION
6367-65536-0054_3879-174923-0024 AND JOYCE WOULD NOT BE WAITING AMONG THE FIRS THE STILE HE REMEMBERED WAS GONE REPLACED BY A LITTLE RUSTIC GATE AS HE PASSED THROUGH IT HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND THERE BEFORE HIM
6367-65536-0055_4898-20016-0002 AND THE SOUL OF HER LOOKED OUT THROUGH THEM TRUE TO ITSELF THE STAUNCH BRAVE SWEET SOUL OF THE MAIDEN RIPENED TO WOMANHOOD JOYCE HE SAID STUPIDLY UNBELIEVINGLY
6367-65536-0057_3112-9555-0061 HE SAID SLOWLY AND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL SHE COLOURED SLIGHTLY AND PULLED AWAY HER HANDS LAUGHING OH INDEED I HAVE I HAVE GROWN OLD
6367-65536-0059_4406-16883-0003 LAST NIGHT I STOOD ON THOSE HILLS YONDER AND LOOKED DOWN BUT I MEANT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO ONE LEFT TO WELCOME ME IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE YOU HAVE LIVED HERE IN THE OLD VALLEY ALL THESE YEARS
6367-65536-0070_1363-139304-0042 LIFE EVEN IN THE GLARE AND TUMULT OF THAT WORLD BEYOND THE HILLS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOST ITS MEANING FOR HIM OH FOOL AND BLIND THAT HE HAD BEEN WHILE HE HAD SOUGHT AND TOILED AFAR
6367-65536-0071_3235-11599-0020 THE BEST THAT GOD HAD MEANT FOR HIM HAD BEEN HERE IN THE HOME OF YOUTH WHEN DARKNESS CAME DOWN THROUGH THE FIRS HE TOLD HER ALL THIS HALTINGLY BLUNDERINGLY YEARNINGLY JOYCE
6367-65536-0072_3168-173564-0033 IS IT TOO LATE CAN YOU FORGIVE MY MISTAKE MY LONG BLINDNESS CAN YOU CARE FOR ME AGAIN A LITTLE SHE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD TO THE SKY BETWEEN THE SWAYING FIR TOPS
6367-65536-0074_8051-295385-0008 IT IS YOURS CUTHBERT IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN YOURS HE DREW HER CLOSE INTO HIS ARMS AND AS HE FELT HER HEART BEATING AGAINST HIS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD FOUND THE WAY BACK TO SIMPLE HAPPINESS AND TRUE WISDOM
6367-74004-0002_2002-139469-0016 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THEY LIKE HIM TOO I HEARD EMMA WHITE SAY ONCE THAT HE WAS SO HANDSOME I NEARLY WHOOPED RUGGLES WAS MAD BECAUSE HE'S GONE ON EM
6367-74004-0003_6209-34601-0024 HE IS SPLENDID BIG SIX FOOTER WITH MAGNIFICENT MUSCLES RED CHEEKS AND CURLY YELLOW HAIR I CAN'T SEE HOW HE CAN BE CONTENTED TO SIT DOWN AND TEACH MUSHY ENGLISH LITERATURE AND POETRY AND THAT SORT OF THING
6367-74004-0004_4898-28461-0043 THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
6367-74004-0005_5322-7680-0021 AT LEAST WE SAID SO BUT IF PROVIDENCE HADN'T SENT SYLVIA GRANT WALKING DOWN THE STREET PAST OUR BOARDING HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE COOLED OFF BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF ANY WORKING PLAN OF REVENGE SYLVIA GRANT DID GO DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER
6367-74004-0006_481-123720-0000 RUGGLES HANGING HALFWAY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS USUAL SAW HER AND CALLED ME TO GO AND LOOK OF COURSE I WENT SYLVIA GRANT WAS ALWAYS WORTH LOOKING AT THERE WAS NO GIRL IN FRAMPTON WHO COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO HER WHEN IT CAME TO BEAUTY
6367-74004-0007_5393-19219-0030 MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
6367-74004-0009_4441-76263-0021 MICKY HAD IT THE WORST AND WE HAD ALL MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT SYLVIA WOULD MARRY MICKY HE WAS SO HANDSOME WE DIDN'T SEE HOW SHE COULD HELP IT I TELL YOU THEY MADE A DANDY LOOKING COUPLE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER WELL AS I SAID BEFORE I TODDLED TO THE WINDOW TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE FAIR SYLVIA
6367-74004-0014_7264-92310-0000 HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
6367-74004-0021_4680-16042-0030 HE STARTED IN BY TELLING HER HOW MUCH HE LOVED HER AND WHAT AN ANGEL OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER HOW UNWORTHY HE FELT HIMSELF OF HER AND HOW LITTLE HOPE HE HAD THAT SHE COULD EVER CARE FOR HIM
6367-74004-0022_4813-248638-0042 AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY
6367-74004-0023_8465-246947-0010 GEORGE OSBORNE THEN WE MAILED IT THAT VERY EVENING
6367-74004-0024_669-129061-0016 IT WAS THE SMARTEST EVENT OF THE TERM AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND OF COURSE SYLVIA GRANT SYLVIA LOOKED STUNNING
6367-74004-0027_5750-100289-0045 SYLVIA STILL LOOKED SMILING AND HAPPY NOT A BIT MAD AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT JUST KIND OF SHY AND RADIANT AS FOR THE OLD FELLOW HE LOOKED AS EM WHITE WOULD SAY AS SPHINX LIKE AS EVER
6367-74004-0029_229-130880-0055 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT SYLVIA FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID KIND OF DRILY AH DID YOU YES SAID SYLVIA NOT MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER IT IT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH I NEVER SUPPOSED THAT YOU
6367-74004-0032_3723-171115-0021 DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU YOU ACTUALLY CARE A LITTLE FOR ME DEAREST OH SYLVIA DO YOU MEAN THAT OF COURSE I DO SAID SYLVIA RIGHT OUT
6367-74004-0033_3214-167607-0008 I'VE ALWAYS CARED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL COMING HERE TO SCHOOL AND BREAKING MY HEART OVER MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH I HATED THEM JUST TO BE IN YOUR CLASS WHY WHY
6367-74004-0034_1723-141149-0046 I THOUGHT IT QUITE USELESS TO TELL YOU OF MY LOVE BEFORE WILL YOU CAN YOU BE MY WIFE DARLING AT THIS POINT RUGGLES AND I DIFFER AS TO WHAT CAME NEXT
6385-220959-0000_403-216-0011 PART TWO SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS
6385-220959-0001_5390-30102-0017 OUTWARD FORMS AND SYMBOLS MUST BE USED TO CONVEY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTIONS
6385-220959-0006_332-128985-0024 THE TASTE DOES NOT DISCERN THE TOUCH DOES NOT FEEL EVEN ETHEREAL MATTER THE FORCES OF WHICH ARE SAID IN PHYSICS TO BE HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
6385-220959-0007_6272-70171-0018 IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND IS NOT SENSIBLE IN THE SAME WAY NATURE ALSO IN ITS ESSENCE IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND IS NOT SENSIBLE THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS AN INTELLECTUAL NOT SENSIBLE REALITY
6385-220959-0008_8609-262281-0015 IN EXPLAINING THESE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES ONE IS OBLIGED TO EXPRESS THEM BY SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN EXTERIOR EXISTENCE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT MATERIAL THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT
6385-220959-0009_3240-131231-0067 ITS CONDITION ITS STATION ONE IS OBLIGED TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS UNDER THE FORMS OF SENSIBLE THINGS BECAUSE IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD ALL THAT EXISTS IS SENSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE GRIEF AND HAPPINESS ARE INTELLECTUAL THINGS
6385-220959-0013_374-180298-0039 IS KNOWLEDGE SENSIBLE LIGHT OR IGNORANCE SENSIBLE DARKNESS NO THEY ARE MERELY SYMBOLS THESE ARE ONLY INTELLECTUAL STATES
6385-220959-0014_6531-61334-0036 BUT WHEN YOU DESIRE TO EXPRESS THEM OUTWARDLY YOU CALL KNOWLEDGE LIGHT AND IGNORANCE DARKNESS YOU SAY MY HEART WAS GLOOMY AND IT BECAME ENLIGHTENED
6385-220959-0015_4297-13009-0011 NOW THAT LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES NOT SENSIBLE ONES BUT WHEN WE SEEK FOR EXPLANATIONS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE ARE OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM A SENSIBLE FORM
6385-220959-0016_5390-30102-0007 THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE DOVE WHICH DESCENDED UPON CHRIST WAS NOT A MATERIAL DOVE BUT IT WAS A SPIRITUAL STATE WHICH THAT IT MIGHT BE COMPREHENSIBLE WAS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE FIGURE
6385-220959-0017_1963-142393-0049 THUS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IT IS SAID THAT GOD APPEARED AS A PILLAR OF FIRE THIS DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE MATERIAL FORM IT IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE IMAGE
6385-220959-0019_7402-59171-0025 AND WAKEFULNESS IS THE CONDITION OF MOVEMENT SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF SILENCE
6385-220959-0020_4830-25898-0055 SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF MYSTERY WAKEFULNESS IS THE STATE OF MANIFESTATION FOR EXAMPLE IT IS A PERSIAN AND ARABIC EXPRESSION TO SAY THAT THE EARTH WAS ASLEEP AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT AWOKE
6385-220959-0021_1235-135887-0006 OR THE EARTH WAS DEAD AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT REVIVED THESE EXPRESSIONS ARE METAPHORS ALLEGORIES MYSTIC EXPLANATIONS IN THE WORLD OF SIGNIFICATION BRIEFLY THE HOLY MANIFESTATIONS HAVE EVER BEEN
6385-220959-0024_2384-152900-0019 AND THAT WITHOUT DOUBT HE HAD A HUMAN FATHER IN THE QUR'AN IT IS SAID AND WE SENT OUR SPIRIT UNTO HER
6385-220959-0030_201-127786-0057 IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A FLAMING GLOBE AND GRADUALLY IT BECAME TEMPERATE A CRUST WAS FORMED AROUND IT AND UPON THIS CRUST PLANTS CAME INTO EXISTENCE THEN ANIMALS AND FINALLY MAN THE THEOLOGIANS SAY
6385-220959-0031_8226-274369-0021 IS NOT THE CREATION OF MAN WITHOUT FATHER AND MOTHER EVEN THOUGH GRADUALLY MORE DIFFICULT THAN IF HE HAD SIMPLY COME INTO EXISTENCE WITHOUT A FATHER AS YOU ADMIT THAT THE FIRST MAN CAME INTO EXISTENCE WITHOUT FATHER OR MOTHER
6385-220959-0033_1624-142933-0006 IF YOU SAY THAT THIS LAMP HAS ONCE BEEN LIGHTED WITHOUT WICK AND OIL AND THEN SAY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIGHT IT WITHOUT THE WICK THIS IS ILLOGICAL CHRIST HAD A MOTHER THE FIRST MAN AS THE MATERIALISTS BELIEVE
6385-220959-0034_6272-70168-0011 THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS DUE TO HIS PERFECTIONS A GREAT MAN IS A GREAT MAN WHETHER BORN OF A HUMAN FATHER OR NOT IF BEING WITHOUT A FATHER IS A VIRTUE
6385-220959-0035_7511-102419-0042 WHICH CAN BE COMPARED TO FATHER AND MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION BUT THE DARKNESS HAS NEITHER SUBSTANCE NOR FORM NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE IMPERFECTION THE SUBSTANCE OF ADAM'S PHYSICAL LIFE WAS EARTH
6385-220959-0037_6476-96661-0013 EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVED ON HIS NAME WHICH WERE BORN NOT OF BLOOD NOR OF THE WILL OF THE FLESH NOR OF THE WILL OF MAN
6385-220959-0038_1743-142912-0008 ALSO IS NOT CREATED BY PHYSICAL POWER BUT BY THE SPIRITUAL REALITY THE HONOR AND GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS NOT DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A HUMAN FATHER BUT TO HIS PERFECTIONS BOUNTIES AND DIVINE GLORY
6385-220959-0039_2416-152139-0070 IF THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS HIS BEING FATHERLESS THEN ADAM IS GREATER THAN CHRIST FOR HE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER IT IS SAID IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE LORD GOD FORMED MAN OF THE DUST OF THE GROUND
6385-220959-0040_2136-5147-0023 AND BREATHED INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE
6385-220959-0041_7113-86041-0029 MOREOVER THE EXPRESSION WHICH JOHN USES IN REGARD TO THE DISCIPLES PROVES THAT THEY ALSO ARE FROM THE HEAVENLY FATHER HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HOLY REALITY MEANING THE REAL EXISTENCE OF EVERY GREAT MAN COMES FROM GOD
6385-220959-0042_4014-186179-0034 AND OWES ITS BEING TO THE BREATH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
6385-220959-0043_5163-18515-0027 FOR HE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER IS IT BETTER FOR A MAN TO BE CREATED FROM A LIVING SUBSTANCE OR FROM EARTH CERTAINLY IT IS BETTER IF HE BE CREATED FROM A LIVING SUBSTANCE BUT CHRIST WAS BORN AND CAME INTO EXISTENCE FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT
6385-34655-0000_4481-17498-0011 THE RESEMBLANCE OF A PALACE TO A WOOD IN PALACES AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION AND CORLEONE LODGE WAS ONE THERE WERE VERY FEW DOORS BUT ABUNDANCE OF TAPESTRY SCREENS AND CURTAINED DOORWAYS
6385-34655-0001_8629-261139-0049 IN EVERY PALACE OF THAT DATE THERE WAS A WONDERFUL LABYRINTH OF CHAMBERS AND CORRIDORS WHERE LUXURY RAN RIOT GILDING MARBLE CARVED WAINSCOTING
6385-34655-0002_405-130895-0010 EASTERN SILKS NOOKS AND CORNERS SOME SECRET AND DARK AS NIGHT OTHERS LIGHT AND PLEASANT AS THE DAY THERE WERE ATTICS RICHLY AND BRIGHTLY FURNISHED BURNISHED RECESSES SHINING WITH DUTCH TILES AND PORTUGUESE AZULEJOS

6385-34669-0013_4640-19189-0032 WAS A DUTCH VESSEL OF THE JAPANESE BUILD WITH TWO DECKS FORE AND AFT AND BETWEEN THEM AN OPEN HOLD REACHED BY AN UPRIGHT LADDER IN WHICH THE CARGO WAS LADEN

6415-111615-0000_19-227-0043 OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
6415-111615-0001_5322-7678-0016 IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE NOBODY NOTICES IT HE SOON OUTGROWS THIS AND IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE NOTICE IT AND HE IMAGINES THAT ALL SEE THE PALTRINESS OF IT AS PLAINLY AS HE DOES
6415-111615-0003_3168-173564-0034 BROODING AT THE SLUTTISH TYPEWRITER HE REMEMBERS THE FLUSH OF SHAME THAT TINGLED HIM AS HE WALKED SADLY HOMEWARD THINKING OF SOME ATROCIOUS INANITY HE HAD SENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPOSING ROOM IT IS A JOB THAT ENGENDERS A HEALTHY HUMILITY
6415-111615-0004_4640-19187-0010 I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A TRY AT WRITING A COLUMN HEAVEN HELP ME I THINK I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WAS BORN FOR THE JOB I MAY AS WELL BE CANDID THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT OF INSERTING THE FOLLOWING AD IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER

6415-111615-0014_328-129766-0083 IT IS HARD TO GET THE COLYUMIST TO ADMIT THIS FOR HE FEARS SPOOFING WORSE THAN THE DEVIL BUT IT IS EMINENTLY TRUE IF I WERE THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0018_7794-295947-0041 WITH ANYTHING BUT HUMILITY AND DESPAIR FRANK HARRIS ONCE SAID OF OSCAR WILDE IF ENGLAND INSISTS ON TREATING HER CRIMINALS LIKE THIS SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY SIMILARLY
6415-111615-0021_3664-11714-0001 ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT

6415-111615-0027_8838-298546-0011 AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM I HALTED AT A WINDOW FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND STUDIED HIM THEN RETURNED TO PASS HIM AGAIN AND WATCHED HIM PATIENTLY HE STOOD QUITE ABSORBED AND WAS STILL THERE WHEN I WENT ON
6415-111615-0028_2136-5143-0004 THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
6415-111615-0029_83-11691-0034 THIS IS THE COLYUMIST'S TASK AS I SEE IT IT IS A TASK NOT A WHIT LESS WORTHY LESS PAINFUL OR LESS BAFFLING THAN THAT OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS NOVELIST
6415-111615-0030_3699-19402-0002 AND IT IS CARRIED ON IN SURROUNDINGS OF EXTRAORDINARY STIMULATION AND DIFFICULTY IT IS HEART RACKING TO STRUGGLE DAY BY DAY AMID INCESSANT INTERRUPTION AND MELEE TO SNATCH OUT OF THE HURLY BURLY SOME SHREDS OF HUMOUR OR PATHOS OR

6415-116629-0018_322-124146-0027 AND MUTTERED I WONDER IF SHE WANTS TO GET HIM TOO

6415-116629-0023_6818-76332-0050 AND IF THE LATTER SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD MATTERS OR HER CHILDREN'S FUTURE GERTRUDE WOULD GIVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAD NO TIME TO STOP TO TALK GERTRUDE KNEW WHERE DIETRICH SPENT HIS EVENINGS SHE HAD EXPOSTULATED WITH HIM ABOUT IT MORE THAN ONCE

6437-66172-0010_3214-167602-0012 A PROLONGED SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT WOULD COME NEXT
6437-66172-0011_2836-5355-0001 THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
6437-66172-0012_2092-145709-0017 IF YOU HAD ADVANCED ANOTHER INCH YOU WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED DOWN AN ABYSS THREE THOUSAND FEET DEEP I NATURALLY SHRUNK BACK AT THIS FRIENDLY PIECE OF INFORMATION A PRICK FROM SOME TWO PRONGED INSTRUMENT EVIDENTLY A PITCHFORK

6437-66172-0015_6209-34600-0030 A SECOND PISTOL SHOT WAS HEARD THE SOMETHING I STOOD ON SUNK WITH A CRASH BENEATH MY FEET AND I FELL TWO MILES AS NEARLY AS I COULD COMPUTE IT AT THE SAME INSTANT THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS WHISKED FROM MY EYES AND I FOUND MYSELF STANDING IN AN EMPTY HOGSHEAD
6437-66172-0016_1447-17506-0019 SURROUNDED BY TWELVE MASKED FIGURES FANTASTICALLY DRESSED ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS REALLY APPALLING WITH A TIN SAUCE PAN ON HIS HEAD AND A TIGER SKIN SLEIGH ROBE THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS I SCARCELY NEED SAY

6437-66172-0018_8975-270782-0072 THE MYSTIC TWELVE REVOLVED ABOUT ME THIS CONCLUDED THE CEREMONY WITH A MERRY SHOUT THE BOYS THREW OFF THEIR MASKS AND I WAS DECLARED A REGULARLY INSTALLED MEMBER OF THE R M C
6437-66172-0021_4297-13009-0031 IN A LOW TONE AS IF NOT INTENDED FOR THE EAR OF THE VICTIM DIABOLUS FETCH ME THE RED HOT IRON THE EXPEDITION WITH WHICH THAT TONGUE WOULD DISAPPEAR WAS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS
6437-66172-0023_8838-298545-0047 WHENEVER A MEMBER HAD REASONS FOR THINKING THAT ANOTHER MEMBER WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND HE CALLED A MEETING FOR INSTANCE IMMEDIATELY ON LEARNING THE DEATH OF HARRY BLAKE'S GREAT GRANDFATHER I ISSUED A CALL
6437-66172-0028_8747-293952-0103 JONES'S AVENUE AT THE NORTH END HAD SUDDENLY BECOME WALNUT STREET AND PEANUT STREET WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND CONFUSION REIGNED THE TOWN AUTHORITIES TOOK THE MATTER IN HAND WITHOUT DELAY
6437-66172-0029_4680-16026-0018 AND SIX OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS WERE SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPBAM HAVING TEARFULLY DISCLAIMED TO MY GRANDFATHER ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRANSACTION I DISAPPEARED FROM THE FAMILY CIRCLE AND WAS NOT APPREHENDED UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
6437-66172-0031_8123-275216-0032 TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF THE OUTRAGED LAWS CHARLEY MARDEN HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN A PILE OF GRAVEL BEHIND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND LOOKED LIKE A RECENTLY EXHUMED MUMMY THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST EVIDENCE AGAINST US AND INDEED WE WERE WHOLLY INNOCENT OF THE OFFENCE
6437-66172-0032_2002-139469-0078 THE TRICK AS WAS AFTERWARDS PROVED HAD BEEN PLAYED BY A PARTY OF SOLDIERS STATIONED AT THE FORT IN THE HARBOR WE WERE INDEBTED FOR OUR ARREST TO MASTER CONWAY WHO HAD SLYLY DROPPED A HINT WITHIN THE HEARING OF SELECTMAN MUDGE TO THE EFFECT THAT
6437-66172-0036_6181-216552-0062 THERE WAS A CERTAIN SLIM MILD APOTHECARY IN THE TOWN BY THE NAME OF MEEKS IT WAS GENERALLY GIVEN OUT THAT MISTER MEEKS HAD A VAGUE DESIRE TO GET MARRIED BUT BEING A SHY AND TIMOROUS YOUTH LACKED THE MORAL COURAGE TO DO SO
6437-66172-0038_7067-76048-0021 WERE OF A NATURE NOT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND WERE NOT MISUNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE BUT MISTER MEEKS HIMSELF THE WIDOW CARRIED ON A DRESS MAKING ESTABLISHMENT AT HER RESIDENCE ON THE CORNER OPPOSITE MEEKS'S DRUG STORE
6437-66172-0039_4014-186175-0006 CASTING DESTRUCTIVE GLANCES ACROSS THE STREET THE ARTIFICIAL ROSES IN HER CAP AND HER WHOLE LANGUISHING MANNER SAYING AS PLAINLY AS A LABEL ON A PRESCRIPTION TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT MISTER MEEKS DIDN'T TAKE
6437-66172-0040_328-129766-0024 THE LADY'S FONDNESS AND THE GENTLEMAN'S BLINDNESS WERE TOPICS ABLY HANDLED AT EVERY SEWING CIRCLE IN THE TOWN IT WAS THROUGH THESE TWO LUCKLESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WE PROPOSED TO STRIKE A BLOW AT THE COMMON ENEMY
6437-66172-0044_6529-62556-0029 WAS RECOGNIZED AT ONCE IT SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE OVER THE TOWN AND THOUGH THE MORTAR AND THE PLACARD WERE SPEEDILY REMOVED OUR TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS ON THE BROAD GRIN AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIR SEEMINGLY UNSUSPECTED
6437-66173-0005_3440-171009-0026 WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
6437-66173-0007_5393-19219-0001 BUT ON SEEING ME SWEEP ACROSS THE YARD WHIRLING MY STRAP OF BOOKS IN THE AIR LIKE A SLING HE CALLED OUT LUSTILY LAY LOW CONWAY HERE'S YOUNG BAILEY CONWAY TURNED JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ON HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW INTENDED FOR HIS HEAD
6437-66173-0008_1737-146161-0013 HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
6437-66173-0010_6415-116629-0008 AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
6437-66173-0011_254-27760-0005 AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
6437-66173-0013_8419-286667-0026 THE BOYS FELL BACK PERFORCE ON THE SCHOOL YARD JUST AT THIS CRISIS A DOZEN OR SO OF THE TEMPLARS ENTERED THE GATE AND SEEING AT A GLANCE THE BELLIGERENT STATUS OF CONWAY AND MYSELF DROPPED BAT AND BALL AND RUSHED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE STOOD
6437-66173-0015_4406-16882-0062 AND PUT BACK MY HAIR THIS LAST CONDITION WAS RATHER A STAGGERER I SHA'N'T DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID CONWAY SULKILY THEN THE THING MUST GO ON SAID ADAMS WITH DIGNITY
6437-66173-0018_6078-54013-0059 COOL IS THE WORD SAID ADAMS AS HE BOUND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY HEAD AND CAREFULLY TUCKED AWAY THE LONG STRAGGLING LOCKS THAT OFFERED A TEMPTING ADVANTAGE TO THE ENEMY WHO EVER HEARD OF A FELLOW WITH SUCH A HEAD OF HAIR GOING INTO ACTION
6437-66173-0020_5652-39938-0016 CONWAY REGARDED THESE BUSINESS LIKE PREPARATIONS WITH EVIDENT MISGIVING FOR HE CALLED RODGERS TO HIS SIDE AND HAD HIMSELF ARRAYED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS CROPPED SO CLOSE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF IT WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS
6437-66173-0021_125-121342-0044 IS YOUR MAN READY ASKED PHIL ADAMS ADDRESSING RODGERS READY KEEP YOUR BACK TO THE GATE TOM
6437-66173-0022_6563-285357-0034 AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SUN IN HIS EYES BEHOLD US ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE LIKE DAVID AND THE PHILISTINE LOOK AT US AS LONG AS YOU MAY FOR THIS IS ALL YOU SHALL SEE OF THE COMBAT
6437-66173-0023_2952-408-0004 ACCORDING TO MY THINKING THE HOSPITAL TEACHES A BETTER LESSON THAN THE BATTLE FIELD I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY BLACK EYE AND MY SWOLLEN LIP IF YOU WILL BUT NOT A WORD OF THE FIGHT
6437-66173-0024_5104-33406-0032 YOU'LL GET NO DESCRIPTION OF IT FROM ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD PROVE VERY POOR READING AND NOT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MY REVOLT AGAINST CONWAY'S TYRANNY UNJUSTIFIABLE I HAD BORNE CONWAY'S PERSECUTIONS FOR MANY MONTHS WITH LAMB LIKE PATIENCE
6437-66173-0026_1743-142912-0005 THE PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE I SUFFERED FROM MY TORMENTOR WAS NOTHING TO THE PAIN HE INFLICTED ON ME INDIRECTLY BY HIS PERSISTENT CRUELTY TO LITTLE BINNY WALLACE I SHOULD HAVE LACKED THE SPIRIT OF A HEN IF I HAD NOT RESENTED IT FINALLY
6437-66173-0027_7780-274562-0064 I AM GLAD THAT I FACED CONWAY AND ASKED NO FAVORS AND GOT RID OF HIM FOREVER I AM GLAD THAT PHIL ADAMS TAUGHT ME TO BOX AND I SAY TO ALL YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO BOX TO RIDE TO PULL AN OAR AND TO SWIM
6437-66173-0029_2952-410-0056 EVER WRITTEN FOR BOYS ARE THESE WORDS LEARN TO BOX THEN AS YOU LEARN TO PLAY CRICKET AND FOOTBALL NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WORSE BUT VERY MUCH THE BETTER FOR LEARNING TO BOX WELL
6437-66173-0030_587-41611-0029 THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO TO A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT SAY NO IF YOU CAN ONLY TAKE CARE YOU MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOURSELF WHY YOU SAY NO IT'S A PROOF OF THE HIGHEST COURAGE IF DONE FROM TRUE CHRISTIAN MOTIVES
6437-66173-0033_3374-298026-0001 WHEN CONWAY RETIRED FROM THE FIELD AS PHIL ADAMS STEPPED UP TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME HE RECEIVED A TELLING BLOW IN THE STOMACH FOR ALL THE FIGHT WAS NOT OUT OF ME YET AND I MISTOOK HIM FOR A NEW ADVERSARY
6437-66173-0034_1455-134435-0028 CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
6437-66173-0039_625-132118-0012 DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
6437-66173-0040_6078-54013-0062 SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
6437-66173-0041_374-180298-0056 WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
6437-66173-0044_3723-171631-0054 CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
6437-66173-0047_8468-295198-0023 DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
6437-66173-0049_163-122947-0049 HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
6437-66173-0052_909-131045-0032 PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR

6437-66173-0062_328-129766-0007 HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
6454-107462-0001_7067-76048-0018 FOR BEING FULL OF THE SOUR CREAM OF AN INHUMAN CURIOSITY HIS CURIOSITY HOWEVER DID NOT EXTEND ITSELF TO SCIENCE
6454-107462-0003_5688-41232-0021 FLIRTATIONS WITH EVERYBODY'S MAID IN THIS WAY HE COULD INFORM HIMSELF EXACTLY HOW MANY LOAVES WERE TAKEN BY THE SWEENEYS FOR A WEEK'S CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH THOSE WHICH WERE DEVOURED BY ALL THE CASSIDYS
6454-107462-0004_248-130652-0000 FOR WHOM THE BOTTLES AT THE PRESBYTERY WENT IN BY THE BACK DOOR AND WHAT WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN THE TWIN MISS MC INERNEYS BUT THESE WERE BUT BLACKBIRD SCRATCHINGS AS IT WERE
6454-107462-0005_3440-171009-0058 UPON THE DEEP SOIL OF THE HUMAN HEART WHAT DEASEY CARED ABOUT WAS WHAT HE CALLED THE SECRETS OF THE SOUL NEVER MET A MAN HE WAS WONT TO SAY WITH NO BACKSTAIRS TO HIS MIND
6454-107462-0008_4214-7146-0052 AND SETTING THE WHISKY BOTTLE BETWIXT HIS CUSTOMER AND HIMSELF WITH A NOD WHICH SAID HELP YOURSELF HE WOULD LEAN FORWARD WITH THE SOFT INDULGENT GRIN OF THE HUMAN MAN OF THE WORLD AND BEGIN NOW
6454-107462-0010_4898-28461-0056 INCRIMINATING FACTS OR CERTAIN LETTERS HE WOULD RING THE CHANGES ON THESE THREE ACCORDING TO THE SEX AND TEMPERAMENT WITH WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL

6454-107462-0014_8425-291444-0012 AND YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME FORTHWITH THE LITTLE SKELETON IN THAT MAN'S CUPBOARD WOULD LEAN FORWARD AND PRESS UPON THE DOOR UNTIL AT LAST THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A BONE OR TWO
6454-107462-0015_7078-271888-0034 AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE SKELETON WOULD RATTLE OUT UPON THE FLOOR HE HAD PLAYED THIS GAME SO OFTEN THAT ALMOST AT FIRST SIGHT HE COULD CLASSIFY HIS DUPES
6454-107462-0017_8014-112602-0036 THOSE WHO ASKED AFTER A GENTLE SIP OR TWO HOW THE LETTER HAD COME INTO HIS HANDS AND THOSE WHO ASKED IMMEDIATELY IF THE LETTER HADN'T BEEN DESTROYED AS A RULE FROM THE TYPE THAT DEMANDED THE LETTER BACK
6454-107462-0020_27-124992-0005 INDEED IT WAS CURIOUSLY INSTRUCTIVE HOW JOHN JAMIESON LAID DOWN A CAUSEWAY OF GLEAMING STEPPING STONES SO THAT DEASEY MIGHT CROSS LIGHTLY OVER THE TURGID WATERS OF HIS VICTIMS SOULS
6454-107462-0021_4195-186236-0015 HAS BEEN INADVERTENTLY REVEALED TO ME BUT IS FOR EVER SACRED IN ME BREAST IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE HOW FROM THE UNDERWORLD OF THE MAN'S MIND THERE WOULD TRIP OUT THE COMPANY OF MISSHAPEN HOBGOBLINS
6454-107462-0027_7148-7763-0023 DEASEY HAD CRAVED FOR CORPSES BUT NOTHING SO GRIM AS THAT HAD RISEN TO HIS WHISKY BAIT UNTIL HE TRIED THE SAME OLD GAME ON MISSUS GERAGHTY WHAT SUBTLE INSTINCT WAS IT THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO ADD

6454-107462-0037_4441-76263-0016 THIS TOUCH OF THE GREY FEET LAID A SPELL ON DEASEY'S HANKERING MORBIDITY WHAT TURNED THE FEET GREY HE WHISPERED
6454-120342-0000_1737-148989-0017 OURS ARE NOT THE CAROLLINGS OF YOUR POOR SHIVERING LITTLE EAST ANGLES OR SOUTH MERCIANS WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLOD ROUND AFOOT IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SLEIGH RIDE IS
6454-120342-0001_7511-102419-0009 I HAD ASKED HARRY TO HAVE SIXTEEN OF THE BEST VOICES IN THE CHAPEL SCHOOL TO BE TRAINED TO EIGHT OR TEN GOOD CAROLS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY WE DID NOT CARE TO DISAPPOINT THEM IF A FEBRUARY THAW SETTING IN ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF DECEMBER

6454-120342-0032_150-126107-0017 AND ALL THE OTHERS RUNG OUT WITH ORDER OR WITHOUT ORDER BREAKING THE HUSH DIRECTLY AS THE HORSES BELLS WERE STILLED THROWN INTO THE AIR WITH ALL THE GLADNESS OF CHILDHOOD
6454-120342-0034_3242-8112-0022 THE STAR THE MANGER AND THE CHILD AT NINE WE BROUGHT UP AT MY HOUSE D STREET THREE DOORS FROM THE CORNER AND THE CHILDREN PICKED THEIR VERY BEST FOR POLLY AND MY SIX LITTLE GIRLS TO HEAR
6454-93938-0001_2911-12359-0017 SEEING THROUGH THE DEVICE THE PARTY HAD AT ONCE GONE TO THIS RANCH WHERE THE OWNER BALDWIN MOUNTED THEM AND IT WAS THEIR DUST CLOUD WE HAD SEEN AS THEY RODE UP TO ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0002_1098-133695-0036 TO MAKE MATTERS MORE SERIOUS BALDWIN HAD ROUNDED UP HIS COWBOYS AND BROUGHT THEM ALONG WITH HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY RESISTANCE IMPOSSIBLE I MADE NO OBJECTION TO THE SHERIFF SERVING THE PAPER
6454-93938-0004_4680-16026-0003 AND ANSWERED THAT I ASKED AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE CASE SO THAT I MIGHT BE HEARD BY COUNSEL IT WAS DENIED AS WAS TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTED INDEED WHY THEY TOOK THE TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH THE FORMS WAS BEYOND ME
6454-93938-0005_5688-41232-0034 I TOLD WILSON I SHOULD NOT PRODUCE THE LETTERS AND HE ASKED IF I KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING AND RETORTING IT VERY APPROPRIATELY MEANS CONTEMPT OF THE COURT YOUR HONOR
6454-93938-0009_8226-274369-0022 THIS MADE ME FEEL PRETTY SERIOUS FOR THE LETTERS WERE IN MY BREAST POCKET AND I SWORE AT MY OWN STUPIDITY IN NOT HAVING PUT THEM IN THE STATION SAFE WHEN I HAD FIRST ARRIVED AT ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0010_8630-305213-0054 THERE WEREN'T MANY MOMENTS IN WHICH TO THINK WHILE THE JUDGE SCRIBBLED AWAY AT THE WARRANT BUT IN WHAT TIME THERE WAS I DID A LOT OF HEAD WORK WITHOUT HOWEVER FINDING MORE THAN ONE WAY OUT OF THE SNARL
6454-93938-0011_201-122255-0029 AND WHEN I SAW THE JUDGE FINISH OFF HIS SIGNATURE WITH A FLOURISH I PLAYED A PRETTY DESPERATE CARD YOU'RE JUST TOO LATE GENTLEMEN I SAID POINTING OUT THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE SALOON THERE COME THE CAVALRY
6454-93938-0012_1246-135815-0006 THE THREE CONSPIRATORS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND BOLTED FOR THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0014_696-93314-0064 I GRABBED THE KEY AND LOCKED THEM IN WHEN I TURNED TO DO SO I SAW THE LOT STRUGGLING UP FROM THE FLOOR AND KNOWING THAT IT WOULDN'T TAKE THEM MANY SECONDS TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0017_2893-139322-0049 AND CONSIDERING THAT HE HAD COVERED OVER FORTY MILES THAT AFTERNOON IN PRETTY QUICK TIME IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH GO LEFT IN HIM
6454-93938-0019_1841-159771-0022 BUT I LOST SIGHT OF THEM THE NEXT MOMENT AS SOON AS I REACHED A STREET LEADING BACK TO THE RAILROAD I TURNED AGAIN AND RODE TOWARDS IT MY ONE THOUGHT BEING TO GET BACK IF POSSIBLE TO THE STATION
6454-93938-0021_6078-54013-0066 TO ESCAPE THEM I HEADED UP THE STREET AWAY FROM THE STATION WITH THE PACK IN CLOSE PURSUIT THEY YELLED AT ME TO HOLD UP AND I EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO HEAR THE CRACK OF REVOLVERS
6454-93938-0024_8419-286667-0030 THAT NOT ONE OF THEM DREW A BEAD ON ME THE MOMENT I SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE I PUT MY HAND IN MY BREAST POCKET AND TOOK OUT THE LETTERS INTENDING TO TEAR THEM INTO A HUNDRED PIECES BUT
6454-93938-0028_7402-90848-0016 THIS PUT ME OUT OF VIEW OF MY PURSUERS FOR A MOMENT AND IN THAT INSTANT I STOOD UP IN MY STIRRUPS LIFTED THE BROAD LEATHER FLAP OF THE SADDLE AND TUCKED THE LETTERS UNDERNEATH IT AS FAR IN AS I COULD FORCE THEM
6454-93938-0029_909-131044-0011 IT WAS A DESPERATE PLACE IN WHICH TO HIDE THEM BUT THE GAME WAS A DESPERATE ONE AT BEST AND THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE IDEA MIGHT BE ITS BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS
6454-93938-0031_696-93314-0002 THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT FRED WAS DUE THE MOMENT I SAW HIM I RODE TOWARDS HIM PRESSING MY PONY FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH MY HOPE WAS THAT I MIGHT GET TIME TO GIVE FRED THE TIP AS TO WHERE THE LETTERS WERE
6454-93938-0032_2289-152258-0005 BUT BEFORE I WAS WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE BALDWIN CAME RUNNING OUT FROM BEHIND THE STATION AND SEEING ME TURNED CALLED BACK AND GESTICULATED EVIDENTLY TO SUMMON SOME COWBOYS TO HEAD ME OFF
6454-93938-0033_201-127786-0079 AFRAID TO SHOUT ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD CONVEY THE SLIGHTEST CLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE LETTERS AS THE NEXT BEST THING I PULLED A COUPLE OF OLD SECTION REPORTS FROM MY POCKET
6454-93938-0034_8312-279791-0012 INTENDING TO RIDE UP AND RUN INTO MY CAR FOR I KNEW THAT THE PAPERS IN MY HAND WOULD BE TAKEN TO BE THE WANTED LETTERS AND THAT IF I COULD ONLY GET INSIDE THE CAR EVEN FOR A MOMENT THE SUSPICION WOULD BE THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIDE THEM
6476-57446-0000_7278-104730-0038 BUT IN THE MIDST OF GAIETY HIS HEART YEARNED ALL THE WHILE FOR HIS LOST LOVE AND HIS MERRIMENT WAS BUT MOURNING IN DISGUISE AT LAST THE NIGHT WORE ON AND AS HE WAS RETIRING ALONG THE CORRIDOR HE SAW A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
6476-57446-0001_2691-156755-0034 WITH LONG HAIR COMING TOWARDS HIM WHO WHEN HE SAW GENZABURO CRIED OUT DEAR ME WHY THIS MUST BE MY YOUNG LORD GENZABURO WHO HAS COME OUT TO ENJOY HIMSELF GENZABURO THOUGHT THIS RATHER STRANGE BUT
6476-57446-0004_6019-3185-0091 I AM LIVING IN A POOR AND HUMBLE HOUSE BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP AT YOUR LEISURE WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A VISIT WELL IT'S A LUCKY CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND I CERTAINLY WILL GO AND SEE YOU BESIDES I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME
6476-57446-0010_3526-176653-0045 WELL THEN SAID GENZABURO GREATLY PLEASED AND DRAWING TEN RIYOS FROM HIS BOSOM THIS IS BUT A SMALL PRESENT TO MAKE TO YOU ON MY FIRST VISIT BUT PRAY ACCEPT IT NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES OF ME
6476-57446-0013_254-12312-0014 WHEN GENZABURO HEARD THIS HE FELT GREATLY RELIEVED AND RECOMMENDING SAZEN TO DO HIS BEST IN THE MATTER TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETURNED HOME THAT VERY NIGHT SAZEN AFTER THINKING OVER ALL THAT GENZABURO HAD TOLD HIM
6476-57446-0015_7278-104730-0009 AND SAID THAT MY LORD GENZABURO HAVING BEEN REBUKED BY HIS FAMILY FOR HIS PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOUR HAD DETERMINED TO BREAK OFF HIS CONNECTION WITH MY DAUGHTER OF COURSE I KNEW THAT THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA WAS NO FITTING MATCH FOR A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0022_4640-19189-0017 BUT AS IT WILL NEVER DO FOR ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW OF IT IT MUST BE MANAGED VERY QUIETLY AND FURTHER WHEN I GET HOME I MUST THINK OUT SOME PLAN TO LULL THE SUSPICIONS OF THAT FELLOW CHOKICHI AND LET YOU KNOW MY IDEA BY LETTER
6476-57446-0023_7780-274562-0006 MEANWHILE O KOYO HAD BETTER COME HOME WITH ME TO NIGHT ALTHOUGH SHE IS SO TERRIBLY OUT OF SPIRITS NOW SHE SHALL MEET GENZABURO THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW KIHACHI REPORTED THIS TO O KOYO AND AS HER PINING FOR GENZABURO WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER SICKNESS
6476-57446-0025_7402-90848-0038 RETURNED HOME TAKING WITH HIM O KOYO AND AFTER O KOYO HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HER HAIR AND PAINTED HERSELF AND PUT ON BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES SHE CAME OUT LOOKING SO LOVELY THAT NO PRINCESS IN THE LAND COULD VIE WITH HER AND SAZEN WHEN HE SAW HER
6476-57446-0029_1447-130550-0026 PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY HIS TEARS MY DAUGHTER O KOYO MOURNING OVER HER SEPARATION FROM MY LORD GENZABURO AT FIRST REFUSED ALL SUSTENANCE AND REMAINED NURSING HER SORROWS UNTIL LAST NIGHT HER WOMAN'S HEART FAILING TO BEAR UP AGAINST HER GREAT GRIEF
6476-57446-0032_7190-90543-0018 TO YOU THROUGH WHOSE INTERVENTION SHE BECAME ALLIED WITH A NOBLEMAN

6476-57446-0034_250-142276-0048 AT LAST CHOKICHI AFTER MUCH PERSUASION AND GREATLY TO HIS OWN DISTRESS WAS OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE MONEY AND WHEN KIHACHI HAD CARRIED OUT ALL SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS HE RETURNED HOME
6476-57446-0035_254-27760-0020 AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT IT WAS THE VERY LETTER WHICH CONTAINED SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS TO KIHACHI AND IN WHICH THE WHOLE STORY WHICH HAD JUST AFFECTED HIM SO MUCH WAS MADE UP WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON HIM HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND EXCLAIMED
6476-57446-0037_8747-293952-0053 AND WENT OFF SECRETLY TO PROWL ABOUT SAZEN'S HOUSE TO WATCH FOR O KOYO DETERMINED TO PAY OFF GENZABURO AND SAZEN FOR THEIR CONDUCT TO HIM IN THE MEANWHILE SAZEN WHO DID NOT FOR A MOMENT SUSPECT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6476-57446-0038_3526-176653-0053 WHEN THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED UPON BY HIM AND GENZABURO ARRIVED MADE O KOYO PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES SMARTENED UP HIS HOUSE AND GOT READY A FEAST AGAINST GENZABURO'S ARRIVAL THE LATTER CAME PUNCTUALLY TO HIS TIME
6476-57446-0042_226-131533-0035 THEN GENZABURO ADDRESSING O KOYO SAID AH IT IS INDEED A LONG TIME SINCE WE MET HOW HAPPY IT MAKES ME TO SEE YOU AGAIN WHY YOUR FACE HAS GROWN QUITE THIN POOR THING HAVE YOU BEEN UNHAPPY
6476-57446-0043_6000-55211-0024 AND O KOYO WITH THE TEARS STARTING FROM HER EYES FOR JOY HID HER FACE AND HER HEART WAS SO FULL THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT GENZABURO PASSING HIS HAND GENTLY OVER HER HEAD AND BACK AND COMFORTING HER SAID

6476-57446-0061_5049-25947-0015 SO I'LL TROUBLE YOU TO COME WITH ME AND THEN I CAN GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO NIGHT CHOKICHI CONSENTING TO THIS THE PAIR LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER NOW SAZEN WHO AS A RONIN WORE A LONG DIRK IN HIS GIRDLE
6476-57446-0062_7067-76048-0019 KEPT LOOKING OUT FOR A MOMENT WHEN CHOKICHI SHOULD BE OFF HIS GUARD IN ORDER TO KILL HIM BUT CHOKICHI KEPT HIS EYES OPEN AND DID NOT GIVE SAZEN A CHANCE AT LAST CHOKICHI AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT STUMBLED AGAINST A STONE AND FELL
6476-57446-0071_103-1240-0057 THE THIRTY SIXTH LAW PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS ALL WANDERING MENDICANTS SUCH AS MALE SORCERERS FEMALE DIVINERS HERMITS BLIND PEOPLE BEGGARS AND TANNERS ETAS HAVE HAD FROM OF OLD THEIR RESPECTIVE RULERS
6476-57446-0072_1081-125237-0107 BE NOT DISINCLINED HOWEVER TO PUNISH ANY SUCH WHO GIVE RISE TO DISPUTES OR WHO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR OWN CLASSES AND ARE DISOBEDIENT TO EXISTING LAWS
6476-57446-0073_3947-13262-0032 AND IF THEY ARE VERY POOR THEY WANDER FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WORKING AS COBBLERS MENDING OLD SHOES AND LEATHER AND SO EARN A SCANTY LIVELIHOOD BESIDES THIS THEIR DAUGHTERS AND YOUNG MARRIED WOMEN GAIN A TRIFLE AS WANDERING MINSTRELS CALLED TORIOI
6476-57446-0075_8324-286683-0022 AND BESIDES THIS THEY HAVE TO PERFORM ALL SORTS OF DEGRADING OFFICES ABOUT CRIMINALS SUCH AS CARRYING SICK PRISONERS FROM THEIR CELLS TO THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND BURYING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
6476-57446-0077_5561-41615-0030 BUT KIYOMORI DESIRING TO DESTROY THE FAMILY OF YOSHITOMO ROOT AND BRANCH ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO BANDS AND SEEK OUT THE CHILDREN AT LAST THEY WERE FOUND BUT TOKIWA WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
6476-57446-0079_4297-13006-0044 BUT THAT IF HE KILLED HER CHILDREN SHE WOULD DESTROY HERSELF RATHER THAN YIELD TO HIS DESIRE WHEN HE HEARD THIS KIYOMORI BEWILDERED BY THE BEAUTY OF TOKIWA SPARED THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN BUT BANISHED THEM FROM THE CAPITAL
6476-57446-0080_2843-152918-0022 AND WHEN HE GREW UP AND BECAME A MAN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AFTER A WHILE YORITOMO LEFT THE PROVINCE AND WENT TO THE WARS LEAVING HIS WIFE PREGNANT AND IN DUE TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A MALE CHILD
6476-57446-0081_2159-179156-0013 TO THE DELIGHT OF HER PARENTS WHO REJOICED THAT THEIR DAUGHTER SHOULD BEAR SEED TO A NOBLEMAN BUT SHE SOON FELL SICK AND DIED AND THE OLD PEOPLE TOOK CHARGE OF THE BABE AND WHEN THEY ALSO DIED THE CARE OF THE CHILD FELL TO HIS MOTHER'S KINSMEN
6476-57446-0082_7264-92310-0026 AND HE GREW UP TO BE A PEASANT NOW KIYOMORI THE ENEMY OF YORITOMO HAD BEEN GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS AND YORITOMO HAD AVENGED THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER BY SLAYING MUNEMORI THE SON OF KIYOMORI AND THERE WAS PEACE THROUGHOUT THE LAND
6476-57446-0084_5514-19192-0031 AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS
6476-57446-0085_2384-152900-0074 SO HE SUMMONED HIM AND SAID IT IS A HARD THING TO SEE THE SON OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE LIVE AND DIE A PEASANT I WILL PROMOTE YOU TO THE RANK OF SAMURAI THEN THE PEASANT ANSWERED MY LORD
6476-57446-0086_307-127535-0041 IF I BECOME A SAMURAI AND THE RETAINER OF SOME NOBLE I SHALL NOT BE SO HAPPY AS WHEN I WAS MY OWN MASTER IF I MAY NOT REMAIN A HUSBANDMAN LET ME BE A CHIEF OVER MEN HOWEVER HUMBLE THEY MAY BE
6476-96661-0001_1624-142933-0045 IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN THERE CAME ONE WHO HAD BOTH WELCOME AND REVERENCE FROM JASON THIS ONE CAME WITHOUT SPEAR OR BOW BEARING IN HIS HANDS A LYRE ONLY HE WAS ORPHEUS
6476-96661-0005_2159-179154-0013 TWO WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR HUNTING NO TWO COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THESE TWO WERE THE FIRST WAS ARCAS HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE HAD RED HAIR AND SAVAGE LOOKING EYES
6476-96661-0008_911-128684-0078 ANOTHER WHO CAME WAS ADMETUS AFTERWARD HE BECAME A FAMOUS KING THE GOD APOLLO ONCE MADE HIMSELF A SHEPHERD AND HE KEPT THE FLOCKS OF KING ADMETUS AND THERE CAME TWO BROTHERS TWINS WHO WERE A WONDER TO ALL WHO BEHELD THEM
6476-96661-0010_2910-131096-0069 WHOSE NAME WAS THESEUS THESEUS'S FATHER WAS AN UNKNOWN KING HE HAD BIDDEN THE MOTHER SHOW THEIR SON WHERE HIS SWORD WAS HIDDEN UNDER A GREAT STONE THE KING HAD HIDDEN IT BEFORE THESEUS WAS BORN
6476-96661-0012_4088-158077-0057 THEY BEGAN TO FELL TREES FOR THE TIMBERS OF THE SHIP THAT WAS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS
6476-96661-0014_481-123720-0054 HE WENT TO THE CITY'S GATE AND HE MET SUCH A MAN ARGUS WAS HIS NAME HE TOLD JASON THAT A DREAM HAD SENT HIM TO THE CITY OF IOLCUS JASON WELCOMED HIM AND LODGED HIM IN THE KING'S PALACE
6476-96661-0015_4362-15663-0041 JASON HAD THEM TAKE THE BEAM FROM THE ROOF OF THE PALACE
6476-96661-0018_8425-291444-0016 UNDER THE EYES OF ARGUS THE MASTER THE SHIP THAT HAD IN IT THE BEAM FROM ZEUS'S GROVE WAS BUILT HIGHER AND WIDER AND THOSE WHO WERE BUILDING THE SHIP OFTEN FELT GOING THROUGH IT TREMORS AS OF A LIVING CREATURE
6476-96661-0019_2893-139322-0022 WHEN THE SHIP WAS BUILT AND MADE READY FOR THE VOYAGE A NAME WAS GIVEN TO IT THE ARGO IT WAS CALLED
6476-96661-0020_150-126112-0013 ALL WAS READY FOR THE VOYAGE AND NOW JASON WENT WITH HIS FRIENDS TO VIEW THE SHIP BEFORE SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE WATER ARGUS THE MASTER WAS ON THE SHIP SEEING TO IT THAT THE LAST THINGS WERE BEING DONE BEFORE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED
6476-96661-0025_2518-154825-0052 SETTING OUT ON THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE PALACE THEY SAW THAT ANOTHER HERO HAD ARRIVED HIS SHIELD WAS HUNG IN THE HALL THE HEROES ALL GATHERED AROUND AMAZED AT THE SIZE AND THE BEAUTY OF IT
6476-96661-0027_83-3054-0008 AROUND THESE FIGURES WERE HEADS OF SNAKES HEADS WITH BLACK JAWS AND GLITTERING EYES TWELVE HEADS SUCH AS MIGHT AFFRIGHT ANY MAN
6476-96661-0028_5322-7678-0034 THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
6476-96661-0029_78-369-0032 SHOWED THE STREAM OF OCEAN THE STREAM THAT ENCIRCLES THE WORLD SWANS WERE SOARING ABOVE AND SWIMMING ON ITS SURFACE ALL IN WONDER THE HEROES GAZED ON THE GREAT SHIELD TELLING EACH OTHER THAT ONLY ONE MAN IN ALL THE WORLD COULD CARRY IT
6529-62554-0000_1334-135589-0034 SO THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED BY THE SUBMARINE EXPLOSION OF THIS TORPEDO CYRUS HARDING COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS DURING THE WAR OF THE UNION HE HAD HAD OCCASION TO TRY THESE TERRIBLE ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION
6529-62554-0001_8747-293952-0090 OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
6529-62554-0002_2092-145706-0070 THE SPEEDY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND A TORPEDO THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED AN IRONCLAD AS EASILY AS A FISHING BOAT YES ALL WAS EXPLAINED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE PRESENCE OF THE TORPEDO IN THE WATERS OF THE CHANNEL
6529-62554-0003_5339-14133-0029 AND I SAY THIS IN ORDER THAT AYRTON MAY BE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE STRANGE EVENTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED DURING THESE TWO YEARS WHO THIS BENEFICENT STRANGER IS WHOSE INTERVENTION HAS SO FORTUNATELY FOR US BEEN MANIFESTED ON MANY OCCASIONS I CANNOT IMAGINE
6529-62554-0004_89-218-0027 WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
6529-62554-0005_2159-179154-0021 AND ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT ONLY A MAN POSSESSED OF PRODIGIOUS POWER COULD RENDER THEM AYRTON IS INDEBTED TO HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE FOR IF IT WAS THE STRANGER WHO SAVED ME FROM THE WAVES AFTER THE FALL FROM THE BALLOON
6529-62554-0007_1578-140049-0015 IN A WORD THAT ALL THOSE INEXPLICABLE EVENTS FOR WHICH WE COULD NOT ASSIGN A REASON ARE DUE TO THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING THEREFORE WHOEVER HE MAY BE WHETHER SHIPWRECKED OR EXILED ON OUR ISLAND WE SHALL BE UNGRATEFUL IF WE THINK OURSELVES FREED FROM GRATITUDE TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0011_2910-131096-0056 WAS IT HE WHO THREW TOP OUT OF THE LAKE AND KILLED THE DUGONG WAS IT HE WHO AS EVERYTHING LEADS US TO BELIEVE SAVED YOU FROM THE WAVES AND THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ANY ONE ELSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACT IF IT WAS HE
6529-62554-0013_250-140277-0014 IF THE INTERVENTION OF A HUMAN BEING IS NOT MORE QUESTIONABLE FOR US I AGREE THAT HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL MEANS OF ACTION BEYOND THOSE POSSESSED BY HUMANITY THERE IS A MYSTERY STILL BUT IF WE DISCOVER THE MAN THE MYSTERY WILL BE DISCOVERED ALSO THE QUESTION THEN IS
6529-62554-0014_8630-305213-0027 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER MY OPINION SAID PENCROFT IS THAT WHOEVER HE MAY BE HE IS A BRAVE MAN AND HE HAS MY ESTEEM BE IT SO ANSWERED HARDING BUT THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER PENCROFT
6529-62554-0015_211-122442-0013 MASTER THEN SAID NEBRASKA MY IDEA IS THAT WE MAY SEARCH AS LONG AS WE LIKE FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT WE SHALL NOT DISCOVER HIM TILL HE PLEASES THAT'S NOT BAD WHAT YOU SAY NEBRASKA OBSERVED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0016_4051-11218-0046 I AM OF NEB'S OPINION SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT THAT IS NO REASON FOR NOT ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE WHETHER WE FIND THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING OR NOT WE SHALL AT LEAST HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0017_196-122150-0034 AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
6529-62554-0018_6476-96661-0026 OF COURSE MY BOY REPLIED PENCROFT SO WOULD I AND ALL OF US I AM NOT INQUISITIVE BUT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF MY EYES TO SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL FACE TO FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE MUST BE HANDSOME TALL STRONG WITH A SPLENDID BEARD RADIANT HAIR
6529-62554-0021_1926-147979-0053 I TOO AS YOU SAID HAVE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO PAY HIM IT WAS HE IT COULD BE ONLY HE WHO MUST HAVE COME TO TABOR ISLAND WHO FOUND THERE THE WRETCH YOU KNEW AND WHO MADE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MAN THERE TO BE SAVED
6529-62554-0022_458-126305-0008 THEREFORE IT IS THANKS TO HIM THAT I HAVE BECOME A MAN AGAIN NO I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM THAT IS SETTLED THEN SAID CYRUS HARDING WE WILL BEGIN OUR RESEARCHES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT LEAVE A CORNER OF THE ISLAND UNEXPLORED
6529-62554-0023_8014-112602-0041 WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
6529-62554-0024_1455-134435-0038 BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
6529-62554-0025_7505-258964-0005 AND HAPPILY THERE WAS NO WANT OF ROOM IN GRANITE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE HOUSED ALL THE TREASURES OF THE ISLAND THE PRODUCTS OF THE COLONY WERE THERE METHODICALLY ARRANGED AND IN A SAFE PLACE AS MAY BE BELIEVED SHELTERED AS MUCH FROM ANIMALS AS FROM MAN
6529-62554-0026_125-121342-0021 THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
6529-62554-0027_4898-20016-0008 CONTAINING ALL THE PROVISIONS ARMS TOOLS AND SPARE UTENSILS IN A WORD ALL THE STORES OF THE COLONY AS TO THE GUNS OBTAINED FROM THE BRIG THEY WERE PRETTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE WHICH AT PENCROFT'S ENTREATY
6529-62554-0028_3807-4923-0001 WERE HOISTED BY MEANS OF TACKLE AND PULLEYS RIGHT UP INTO GRANITE HOUSE EMBRASURES WERE MADE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS AND THE SHINING MUZZLES OF THE GUNS COULD SOON BE SEEN THROUGH THE GRANITE CLIFF FROM THIS HEIGHT THEY COMMANDED ALL UNION BAY
6529-62554-0029_7078-271888-0058 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
6529-62554-0030_8747-293952-0038 TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
6529-62554-0033_8425-291444-0007 THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF POWDER USED IN THE FABRICATION OF THESE PIECES EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON EMPLOYING A METAL WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POWER OF RESISTANCE AND STEEL IS INCONTESTABLY THAT METAL OF ALL OTHERS WHICH RESISTS THE BEST
6529-62554-0035_3168-173565-0028 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
6529-62554-0037_19-227-0044 THEY WERE CHARGED WITH PYROXYLE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ITS EXPLOSIVE POWER WHICH AS HAS BEEN SAID IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF ORDINARY POWDER THE PROJECTILE TO BE FIRED WAS CYLINDROCONIC PENCROFT HOLDING THE END OF THE QUICK MATCH
6529-62554-0044_3857-182315-0011 HE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE AS ANY ONE YES SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT HIS RESERVE DOES HIM HONOR AND IT IS RIGHT TO RESPECT THE FEELING WHICH HE HAS ABOUT HIS SAD PAST CERTAINLY MISTER SPILETT ANSWERED THE SAILOR
6529-62554-0045_8797-294123-0022 IS THAT YOUR OPINION PENCROFT ASKED THE ENGINEER QUITE MY OPINION AND BEFORE HUNTING THEM MERCILESSLY YOU WOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY HAD COMMITTED SOME FRESH ACT OF HOSTILITY AGAINST US
6529-62554-0046_26-495-0018 PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
6529-62554-0051_6019-3185-0062 SUPPOSE ONE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE MEN WERE HERE BEFORE YOU WITHIN GOOD RANGE OF YOUR GUNS YOU WOULD NOT FIRE I WOULD FIRE ON HIM AS I WOULD ON A MAD DOG NEBRASKA REPLIED PENCROFT COLDLY PENCROFT SAID THE ENGINEER
6529-62554-0054_322-124147-0008 AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
6529-62554-0056_6367-65536-0044 AND NOW SIX CONVICTS OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION PERHAPS WERE ROAMING OVER THEIR ISLAND IT WAS SERIOUS CERTAINLY AND TO LESS BRAVE MEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SECURITY LOST NO MATTER
6529-62556-0000_1263-139804-0027 AT HERBERT'S CRY PENCROFT LETTING HIS GUN FALL RUSHED TOWARDS HIM THEY HAVE KILLED HIM HE CRIED MY BOY THEY HAVE KILLED HIM CYRUS HARDING AND GIDEON SPILETT RAN TO HERBERT THE REPORTER LISTENED TO ASCERTAIN IF THE POOR LAD'S HEART WAS STILL BEATING
6529-62556-0004_2391-145015-0007 ON SEEING HERBERT SENSELESS THE SAILOR'S GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE HE SOBBED HE CRIED HE TRIED TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE REPORTER COULD CALM HIM
6529-62556-0008_8098-278278-0039 HE UTTERED A MOAN SO FEEBLE THAT THEY ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS HIS LAST SIGH HERBERTS BACK WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM ANOTHER CONTUSED WOUND BY WHICH THE BALL HAD IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED GOD BE PRAISED SAID THE REPORTER THE BALL IS NOT IN THE BODY AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT IT
6529-62556-0009_1088-134315-0048 BUT THE HEART ASKED HARDING THE HEART HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED IF IT HAD BEEN HERBERT WOULD BE DEAD DEAD EXCLAIMED PENCROFT WITH A GROAN THE SAILOR HAD ONLY HEARD THE LAST WORDS UTTERED BY THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0011_8088-284756-0053 PENCROFT WAS SILENT BUT A REACTION SET IN AND GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS IN THE MEANWHILE GIDEON SPILETT ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT HIS IDEAS AND PROCEED METHODICALLY AFTER HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE BALL
6529-62556-0012_6836-61804-0019 ENTERING IN FRONT BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH RIBS HAD ISSUED BEHIND BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH BUT WHAT MISCHIEF HAD THE BALL COMMITTED IN ITS PASSAGE WHAT IMPORTANT ORGANS HAD BEEN REACHED A PROFESSIONAL SURGEON WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THIS AT ONCE
6529-62556-0013_5456-62014-0011 AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
6529-62556-0016_2514-149482-0067 THE REPORTER THEREFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SIMPLY BATHE THE TWO WOUNDS WITH COLD WATER HERBERT WAS PLACED ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND WAS MAINTAINED IN THAT POSITION HE MUST NOT BE MOVED SAID GIDEON SPILETT

6529-62556-0022_3983-5371-0050 DID THE COLONISTS POSSESS AN EFFICACIOUS AGENT TO ACT AGAINST THE INFLAMMATION WHICH MIGHT OCCUR YES THEY HAD ONE FOR NATURE HAD GENEROUSLY LAVISHED IT THEY HAD COLD WATER THAT IS TO SAY THE MOST POWERFUL SEDATIVE THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED AGAINST INFLAMMATION OF WOUNDS
6529-62556-0024_6925-80680-0031 SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT CONTACT WITH THE AIR IS DANGEROUS DURING THE FIRST DAYS GIDEON SPILETT AND CYRUS HARDING REASONED THUS WITH THEIR SIMPLE GOOD SENSE AND THEY ACTED AS THE BEST SURGEON WOULD HAVE DONE
6529-62556-0025_7302-86815-0023 COMPRESSES OF LINEN WERE APPLIED TO POOR HERBERT'S TWO WOUNDS AND WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY WET WITH COLD WATER THE SAILOR HAD AT FIRST LIGHTED A FIRE IN THE HUT WHICH WAS NOT WANTING IN THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE MAPLE SUGAR MEDICINAL PLANTS

6531-61334-0015_6064-56165-0027 A SURE INDICATION THAT ASSYRIA WAS ONCE AGAIN BECOMING POWERFUL IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE REGIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0016_7278-246956-0019 INAUGURATED A VERITABLE REIGN OF TERROR IN MESOPOTAMIA AND NORTHERN SYRIA HIS METHODS OF DEALING WITH REVOLTING TRIBES WERE OF A MOST SAVAGE CHARACTER CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES

6531-61334-0019_2893-139310-0036 LIKE HIS FATHER ASHUR NATSIR PAL FOUGHT AGAINST THE MUSKI WHOSE POWER WAS DECLINING THEN HE TURNED SOUTHWARD FROM THE BORDERS OF ASIA MINOR AND DEALT WITH A REBELLION IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AN ARAMAEAN PRETENDER NAMED AKHIABABA
6531-61334-0022_1743-142912-0004 THESE HE DISPOSED OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC BARBARITY SOME WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND SOME IMPALED ON STAKES WHILE OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED IN A PILLAR WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED TO REMIND THE ARAMAEANS OF HIS DETERMINATION TO BROOK NO OPPOSITION
6531-61334-0023_2910-131096-0035 AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN FLAYED THEIR SKINS WERE NAILED UPON THE CITY WALLS ANOTHER REVOLT BROKE OUT IN THE KIRKHI DISTRICT BETWEEN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE TIGRIS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0026_4859-29340-0024 THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG
6531-61334-0029_3374-298032-0026 I REARED A COLUMN OF THE LIVING AND A COLUMN OF HEADS I HUNG ON HIGH THEIR HEADS ON TREES IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR CITY THEIR BOYS AND GIRLS I BURNED UP IN FLAMES I DEVASTATED THE CITY DUG IT UP IN FIRE BURNED IT
6531-61334-0030_3526-176653-0007 HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6531-61334-0033_6181-216552-0107 THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA GAVE MUCH TROUBLE TO ASHUR NATSIR PAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD LAID A HEAVY HAND ON SURU THE SOUTHERN TRIBES THE SUKHI STIRRED UP REVOLTS IN MESOPOTAMIA AS THE ALLIES OF THE BABYLONIANS
6531-61334-0038_289-121665-0008 HAVING ACCUMULATED GREAT BOOTY HE ENGAGED HIMSELF AS SOON AS PEACE WAS SECURED THROUGHOUT HIS EMPIRE IN REBUILDING THE CITY OF KALKHI WHERE HE ERECTED A GREAT PALACE AND MADE RECORDS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
6531-61334-0040_4051-11217-0036 SHEEP AND CATTLE AND HORSES AND FROM THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES CAME MUCH SILVER AND GOLD COPPER AND LEAD JEWELS AND IVORY AS WELL AS RICHLY DECORATED FURNITURE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS
6531-61334-0041_1867-154071-0043 ARTISTS AND ARTISANS WERE ALSO PROVIDED BY THE VASSALS OF ASSYRIA THERE ARE TRACES OF PHOENICIAN INFLUENCE IN THE ART OF THIS PERIOD ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S GREAT PALACE AT KALKHI WAS EXCAVATED BY LAYARD
6531-61334-0042_5514-19192-0047 WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
6531-61334-0044_60-121082-0096 AS THE SUN WENT DOWN BEHIND THE LOW HILLS WHICH SEPARATE THE RIVER FROM THE DESERT EVEN THEIR ROCKY SIDES HAD STRUGGLED TO EMULATE THE VERDANT CLOTHING OF THE PLAIN ITS RECEDING RAYS WERE GRADUALLY WITHDRAWN
6531-61334-0046_1867-154071-0020 KESHAF ANOTHER VENERABLE RUIN ROSE INDISTINCTLY INTO THE EVENING MIST STILL MORE DISTANT AND STILL MORE INDISTINCT WAS A SOLITARY HILL OVERLOOKING THE ANCIENT CITY OF ARBELA

6531-61334-0050_7859-102518-0034 LAYARD EXCAVATED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE AND DISPATCHED TO LONDON AMONG OTHER TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY
6531-61334-0051_1088-134315-0044 THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
6531-61334-0052_118-121721-0002 THEY REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WHICH HOWEVER HAD A MATERIALISTIC BASIS ASSYRIAN ART FOUND EXPRESSION IN DELINEATING THE OUTWARD FORM RATHER THAN IN STRIVING TO CREATE A THING OF BEAUTY WHICH IS A JOY FOR EVER
6531-61334-0054_250-142276-0003 WHOSE MILITARY ACTIVITIES EXTENDED OVER HIS WHOLE REIGN
6531-61334-0056_307-127539-0005 ESTABLISHED THE RELIGION OF THE CANAANITES AND MADE GODS AND MOLTEN IMAGES HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR HIS IDOLATRY BY THE PROPHET AHIJAH WHO DECLARED THE LORD SHALL SMITE ISRAEL AS A REED IS SHAKEN IN THE WATER
6531-61334-0057_1723-141149-0020 AND HE SHALL ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND WHICH HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SHALL SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE RIVER
6531-61334-0058_5778-12761-0047 AND HIS PEOPLE SLEW THEM WITH A GREAT SLAUGHTER SO THERE FELL DOWN SLAIN IN ISRAEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN THUS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE BROUGHT UNDER AT THAT TIME AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED UPON THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS
6531-61334-0059_403-128339-0002 AND ABIJAH PURSUED AFTER JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF AND JESHANAH WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF
6531-61334-0062_3242-67168-0009 FOR HE TOOK AWAY THE ALTARS OF THE STRANGE GODS AND THE HIGH PLACES AND BRAKE DOWN THE IMAGES AND CUT DOWN THE GROVES AND COMMANDED JUDAH TO SEEK THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND TO DO THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT
6531-61334-0063_5463-39174-0011 ALSO HE TOOK AWAY OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE IMAGES
6531-61334-0064_1363-139304-0031 HE PROCEEDED TO FORTIFY RAMAH A FEW MILES TO THE NORTH OF JERUSALEM
6531-61334-0065_4813-248641-0008 AND APPARENTLY SUPPORTED THE REBELLIONS OF THE NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIAN KINGS
6531-61334-0067_481-123719-0033 IN THE HOUR OF PERIL JUDAH SOUGHT THE AID OF THE KING OF DAMASCUS
6531-61334-0068_4014-186183-0010 AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS
6531-61334-0069_8747-293952-0026 THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
6531-61334-0070_4297-13006-0037 WHEN HE WAS MURDERED BY HIS SERVANT ZIMRI CAPTAIN OF HALF HIS CHARIOTS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE HOUSE OF ARZA STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE IN TIRZAH
6531-61334-0071_3259-158083-0102 ZIMRI'S REVOLT WAS SHORTLIVED HE REIGNED ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENCAMPED HEARD SAY
6531-61334-0074_6367-65536-0062 AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND YE WALK IN THEIR COUNSEL
6531-61334-0076_311-124404-0103 TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BROKEN THE POWER OF AKHUNI
6531-61334-0077_83-11691-0024 THE LEADER OF A STRONG CONFEDERACY OF PETTY STATES THEREAFTER THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH TURNED TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND ATTACKED THE HITTITE STATE OF HAMATH
6531-61334-0078_3983-5371-0038 THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0079_1081-125237-0049 IT WAS OF NO GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR HE WAS UNABLE TO FOLLOW IT UP
6531-61334-0083_3830-12530-0009 DURING THIS PERIOD BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS HAD BEEN DRAWN TOGETHER
6531-61334-0084_2436-2477-0012 AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR
6531-61334-0089_3526-176651-0008 AFTERWARDS REIGNED OVER BABYLONIA AS THE VASSAL OF ASSYRIA AND SHALMANESER HIS OVERLORD MADE OFFERINGS TO THE GODS AT BABYLON BORSIPPA AND CUTHAH
6531-61334-0090_200-126784-0009 AND COMPELLED TO PAY ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHALMANESER HAD TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION INTO NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND SUPPRESS A FRESH REVOLT IN THAT TROUBLED REGION BUT THE WESTERN ALLIES SOON GATHERED STRENGTH AGAIN
6531-61334-0092_7190-90543-0038 REMAINED UNCONQUERED AND CONTINUED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE RESISTING POWER OF THE SYRIAN ALLIES HOWEVER WAS BEING GREATLY WEAKENED BY INTERNAL REVOLTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN STIRRED UP BY ASSYRIAN EMISSARIES
6531-61334-0095_1034-121119-0001 JEHU CONSPIRED AGAINST JORAM AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN ESCORT
6531-61334-0096_2691-156750-0008 SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
6531-61334-0097_1737-148989-0002 AND INFORMED JORAM WHO TWICE SENT OUT A MESSENGER TO ENQUIRE IS IT PEACE NEITHER MESSENGER RETURNED AND THE WATCHMAN INFORMED THE WOUNDED MONARCH OF ISRAEL HE CAME EVEN UNTO THEM AND COMETH NOT AGAIN
6531-61334-0098_27-124992-0041 AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
6531-61334-0101_4297-13009-0049 HE FLED TO SAVE HIS LIFE HAZAEL TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE WALLS OF DAMASCUS WHICH THE ASSYRIANS BESIEGED BUT FAILED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE SHALMANESER'S SOLDIERS MEANWHILE WASTED AND BURNED CITIES WITHOUT NUMBER
6531-61334-0102_302-123523-0002 AND CARRIED AWAY GREAT BOOTY IN THOSE DAYS SHALMANESER RECORDED I RECEIVED TRIBUTE FROM THE TYRIANS AND SIDONIANS AND FROM YAUA JEHU
6531-61334-0103_4014-186179-0027 SHOWS THAT THE UNPRONOUNCED ALEPH AT THE END WAS AT THAT TIME SOUNDED
6531-61334-0104_1098-133695-0089 JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
6531-61334-0106_4788-294466-0008 FOR ALTHOUGH HE STAMPED OUT THE PHOENICIAN RELIGION HE BEGAN TO WORSHIP THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT WERE IN BETHEL AND THAT WERE IN DAN
6531-61334-0109_1447-130550-0020 THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND SAID GOD SAVE THE KING
6531-61334-0113_1098-133695-0090 HAVE HER FORTH OF THE RANGES AND WHOSO FOLLOWETH HER LET HIM BE SLAIN BY THE SWORD FOR THE PRIEST SAID SLAY HER NOT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER
6531-61334-0114_5456-58161-0019 AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
6531-61334-0116_7226-86964-0046 AND KEPT HIS GENERALS CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED SUPPRESSING REVOLTS ON HIS FRONTIERS AFTER HE SUBDUED THE HITTITES
6531-61334-0121_311-124404-0029 ARBELA IMGURBEL AND DUR BALAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DEPENDENCIES SHALMANESER RETAINED KALKHI AND THE PROVINCES OF NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND IT APPEARS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE ARMY ALSO REMAINED LOYAL TO HIM
6531-61334-0123_7113-86041-0000 WHEN AT LENGTH THE NEW KING HAD STAMPED OUT THE LAST EMBERS OF REVOLT WITHIN THE KINGDOM HE HAD TO UNDERTAKE THE RECONQUEST OF THOSE PROVINCES WHICH IN THE INTERVAL
6531-61334-0132_1553-140048-0042 FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY AFTER THIS DISASTER BABYLONIA WAS A PROVINCE OF ASSYRIA
6563-285357-0000_3983-5371-0007 THIS IMPERIAL APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE INVENTOR'S FORTUNES IT STIMULATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE SECOND AIRSHIP WAS TAKEN IN HAND BUT MISFORTUNE STILL PURSUED HIM
6563-285357-0001_2910-131096-0003 ACCIDENTS WERE OF ALMOST DAILY OCCURRENCE DEFECTS WERE REVEALED HERE AND WEAKNESSES SOMEWHERE ELSE SO SOON AS ONE TROUBLE WAS OVERCOME ANOTHER MADE ITSELF MANIFEST THE RESULT WAS THAT THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY COLLECTED BY HIS HARD WORK
6563-285357-0003_27-124992-0054 TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS SUBJECT'S UPHILL STRUGGLE AND THE WURTEMBERG GOVERNMENT GRANTED HIM THE PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY WITH THIS MONEY AND WITH WHAT HE SUCCEEDED IN RAISING BY HOOK AND BY CROOK AND BY MORTGAGING HIS REMAINING PROPERTY
6563-285357-0004_7402-90848-0027 AND IN NINETEEN O FIVE IT WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON ITS PREDECESSORS THE AIRSHIP WAS FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN FEET IN LENGTH BY THIRTY EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVENTEEN GAS BALLOONS
6563-285357-0008_8468-295198-0017 SHE WAS DRIVEN DEEPER INTO THE LAKE THE VESSEL ONLY BEING SAVED BY HURRIED DEFLATION SIX WEEKS WERE OCCUPIED IN REPAIRS BUT ANOTHER ASCENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O SIX THE TRIALS WERE FAIRLY SATISFACTORY
6563-285357-0011_374-180299-0014 AND ARRANGEMENTS TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE THEREOF INCORPORATED IN THE SUCCEEDING CRAFT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER AS SOON AS ONE DEFECT WAS REMEDIED ANOTHER ASSERTED ITSELF IT WAS THIS PERSISTENT REVELATION OF THE UNEXPECTED
6563-285357-0013_8580-287363-0033 WHO HAD NOW TAKEN COUNT ZEPPELIN UNDER HIS WING A STATE LOTTERY WAS INAUGURATED THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE HANDED OVER TO THE INDEFATIGABLE INVENTOR TOGETHER WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT IF HE COULD KEEP ALOFT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITHOUT COMING TO EARTH IN THE MEANTIME
6563-285357-0016_5022-29405-0009 TO THOSE IMPOSED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TEST ON JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN O EIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY SIX A M THE CRAFT ASCENDED AND REMAINED ALOFT FOR TWELVE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE AN ENCOURAGING CIRCULAR TOUR FLUSHED WITH THIS SUCCESS
6563-285357-0017_8098-278252-0015 THE COUNT CONSIDERED THAT THE OFFICIAL AWARD WAS WITHIN REACH AND THAT ALL HIS PREVIOUS DISASTERS AND MISFORTUNES WERE ON THE EVE OF REDEMPTION THE CRUCIAL TEST WAS ESSAYED ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY TWELVE OBSERVERS
6563-285357-0020_8747-293952-0106 AS IF INFURIATED AT THE CONQUEST ROSE UP IN REBELLION A SUDDEN SQUALL STRUCK THE UNWIELDY MONSTER WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS IT BECAME UNMANAGEABLE AND THROUGH SOME INSCRUTABLE CAUSE IT CAUGHT FIRE WITH THE RESULT THAT WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS
6563-285357-0021_32-4137-0039 IT WAS REDUCED TO A TANGLED MASS OF METALLIC FRAMEWORK IT WAS A CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY VANQUISHED MANY AN INVENTOR BUT THE COUNT WAS SAVED THE GALL OF DEFEAT HIS FLIGHT WHICH WAS REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE HAD COVERED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
6563-285357-0023_8630-305213-0033 APPRECIATED HIS GENIUS AND PROMPTLY POURED FORTH A STREAM OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ENABLE HIM TO BUILD ANOTHER VESSEL THE INTIMATION THAT OTHER POWERS HAD APPROACHED THE COUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF HIS IDEA BECAME KNOWN FAR AND WIDE
6563-285357-0024_4859-26870-0005 TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD UNEQUIVOCALLY REFUSED ALL OFFERS HE WAS STRIVING FOR THE FATHERLAND
6563-285357-0026_40-222-0030 BY COLLIDING WITH A TREE THE FINAL INCIDENT PASSED UNNOTICED
6563-285357-0028_4267-78186-0037 A FORMIDABLE ENGINE OF INVASION AND AERIAL ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTED CONSEQUENTLY THE GRAND IDEA MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM THE COUNT WAS HAILED BY HIS AUGUST MASTER AS THE GREATEST GERMAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
6563-285357-0029_911-128684-0039 AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
6563-285357-0031_1723-141149-0078 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN WAS ACCEPTED AS A PERFECT MACHINE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISPERSE THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISASTER WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN ENVELOPED FROM THE FIRST VESSEL AFTER VESSEL HAS GONE UP IN SMOKE AND FLAME FEW CRAFT OF THIS TYPE
6563-285357-0032_5049-25947-0019 HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN AN EVANESCENT EXISTENCE
6563-285357-0036_4195-186237-0018 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY SUCH BIG CRAFT DEMAND LARGE DOCKS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND IN TURN A LARGE STRUCTURE OF THIS CHARACTER CONSTITUTES AN EASY MARK FOR HOSTILE ATTACK AS THE RAIDING AIRMEN OF THE ALLIES HAVE
6563-285357-0037_2159-179156-0018 PROVED VERY CONVINCINGLY BUT THE ZEPPELIN MUST NOT BE UNDER RATED MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THESE VESSELS SUCH AS THE ROUND ONE THOUSAND MILES TRIP IN NINETEEN O NINE AND SEVERAL OTHER
6563-285357-0039_8088-284756-0113 MANY VIVID PROPHECIES OF THE FORTHCOMING FLIGHTS BY ZEPPELIN HAVE BEEN UTTERED AND IT IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE WILL BE FULFILLED BUT SUCCESS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE RATHER TO ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN
6563-285357-0041_7059-88364-0027 GROSS CRAFT HAVE MET WITH WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT SINCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR VALUE AS VESSELS OF THE AIR WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR MILITARY VALUE THE PARSEVAL IS PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
6563-285357-0043_8063-274117-0005 CLOSELY FOLLOWING THOSE OF THE EARLY FRENCH SUPPLE AIRSHIPS THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER CRAFT WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS RECOGNISED BY THE GERMAN NATION AS SUBSTANTIAL UNITS OF WAR SUCH AS THE RUTHEMBERG SIEMENS SCHUKERT AND SO FORTH
6563-285357-0044_696-93314-0042 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
6563-63821-0000_1992-141719-0003 PETER FORCE ONE OF THE INTERESTING SIGHTS OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON USED TO BE THE LIBRARY OF OLD PETER FORCE AS HE WAS FAMILIARLY CALLED COLONEL PETER FORCE AS HE WAS MORE PROPERLY STYLED
6563-63821-0005_4014-186176-0040 AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM RELATING IN SOME WAY TO AMERICAN HISTORY THE PLACE HAD A VERY MUSTY SMELL AND AS MOST OF ITS TREASURES WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BINDINGS OR WITHOUT BINDINGS FEW PERSONS WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE COLLECTION
6563-63821-0007_1970-28415-0003 BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
6563-63821-0008_3112-9555-0062 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING HIS TREASURES HE WOULD TAKE DOWN HIS EXCELLENT COPY OF ELIOT'S INDIAN BIBLE A BOOK SO FAITHFULLY MADE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT I QUESTION IF AS A MERE PIECE OF BOOK MAKING
6563-63821-0010_4441-76250-0027 THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES

6563-63821-0018_4898-28461-0008 THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE LIBRARY WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND THE NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND THE READER PERHAPS IMAGINES THAT THE COLLECTOR OF SUCH A LIBRARY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN
6563-63821-0020_2893-139310-0012 WHO BEGAN LIFE A JOURNEYMAN PRINTER AND WAS NEVER IN THE RECEIPT OF A LARGE INCOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER SO VAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL PART OF THE SECRET WAS THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE HIS COLLECTION THESE THINGS WERE NOT VALUED
6563-63821-0021_7190-90543-0031 AND HE OBTAINED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS RELICS BY MERELY TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY FROM THE GARRETS IN WHICH THEY WERE MOULDERING INTO DUST UNPRIZED AND UNKNOWN A WISE OLD NEW YORK MERCHANT LONG AGO HIMSELF MOULDERED INTO DUST
6563-63821-0022_83-3054-0011 USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
6563-63821-0024_2092-145709-0001 THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR SURPLUS FORCE TIME AND REVENUE TO GET IT IF YOU WANTED YOUR MILLION AS MUCH AS YOU WANT PLEASURE BY AND BY WHEN YOU HAVE A BALD HEAD LIKE MINE YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR MILLION
6563-63821-0030_6836-61803-0031 WHO SERVED DURING THE REVOLUTION IN A NEW JERSEY REGIMENT RETIRED AFTER THE WAR TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND AT HIS HOUSE THE JERSEY VETERANS LIKED TO MEET AND TALK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS THEY HAD MADE TOGETHER PETER AS A BOY
6563-63821-0031_831-130746-0016 LOVED TO HEAR THEM TELL THEIR STORIES AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM ONE EVENING WHY SHOULD ALL THIS BE FORGOTTEN BOY AS HE WAS HE BEGAN TO WRITE THEM DOWN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE UNWRITTEN HISTORY OF THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY
6563-63821-0033_1898-145724-0003 WHICH HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL TO MORE THAN ONE VALUABLE AMERICAN MIND HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINTER AND AT TWENTY TWO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TYPOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AN ORGANIZATION WHICH STILL EXISTS
6563-63821-0034_7278-246956-0017 THEN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BEGAN LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE SERVED IN THE ARMY FIRST AS PRIVATE THEN AS SERGEANT THEN AS SERGEANT MAJOR THEN AS ENSIGN FINALLY AS LIEUTENANT THE WAR ENDED
6563-63821-0036_3374-298032-0021 THOUGH NEVER WITHOUT A SHARE OF REASONABLE PROSPERITY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF HIS LIFE WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN ARCHIVES IN WHICH HE WAS AIDED BY CONGRESS HE FURNISHING THE DOCUMENTS AND THE LABOR
6563-63821-0037_2416-152139-0051 AND CONGRESS PAYING THE COST OF PUBLICATION THROUGH THE NINE VOLUMES OF THIS WORK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING RECORDS AND MEMORIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY ARE NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO CAN GET NEAR A LIBRARY
6563-63821-0042_5390-24512-0048 BUT NEITHER MARCY NOR HIS SUCCESSORS EVER FOUND TIME TO EXAMINE THAT TENTH VOLUME THOUGH ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY OFFICIAL YEAR THE COMPILER CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO IT FOR SEVEN YEARS HE WAS A SUITOR ON BEHALF OF HIS BELOVED TENTH VOLUME
6563-63821-0043_3699-19402-0023 AND THEN THE WAR OCCURRED AND ALL SUCH MATTERS WERE NECESSARILY PUT ASIDE HE WAS NOW SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS GREAT DESIRE WAS TO DISPOSE OF HIS LIBRARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS TREASURES WOULD NOT BE SCATTERED ABROAD
6563-63821-0045_4195-17507-0026 FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE COLLECTION NOW FORMS PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY COLONEL FORCE LIVED TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN HE DIED AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSALLY BELOVED AND LAMENTED

6818-76332-0001_730-358-0059 SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME
6818-76332-0005_8063-274117-0030 AT LAST HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THEM AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BETWEEN THEM ON THE SOFA THEY WONDERED NERVOUSLY WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MY LITTLE GIRLS SHE BEGAN FORGIVE ME

6818-76332-0027_3440-171006-0015 SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR

6818-76332-0056_5652-39938-0064 THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
6836-61803-0000_5652-39938-0026 IT IS NOW EVENING AND THE SUNBEAMS FALLING ASLANT INTRUDE UPON THE SPACE CANOPIED BY THE TREE FROM THE GOLDEN BRIGHTNESS DISPLAYED BY THEM AT NOON
6836-61803-0001_40-222-0016 AS IF THERE WAS ANGER IN THE SKY IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE PORTENT OF AN APPROACHING STORM
6836-61803-0002_6181-216552-0002 FOR ALL THIS IT IS REMARKED AS SINGULAR THAT A STORM SHOULD BE COMING AT THE TIME SINCE IT SYMBOLISES THE SENTIMENT OF THE SPECTATORS WHO LOOK ON WITH SULLENNESS IN THEIR HEARTS AND GLOOM IN THEIR GLANCES
6836-61803-0004_7367-86737-0117 AND IS HENCEFORTH ONLY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN THE PLACE LATE OCCUPIED BY HIM ANOTHER STANDS CASSIUS CALHOUN IS NOW THE PRISONER AT THE BAR
6836-61803-0005_8580-287364-0019 THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE OBSERVABLE THE JUDGE IS THE SAME THE JURY THE SAME AND THE SPECTATORS AS BEFORE THOUGH WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS IN REGARD TO THE CRIMINALITY OF THE ACCUSED
6836-61803-0012_3607-29116-0007 THAT DREAD EMBLEM OF DEATH PREPARATORY TO PRONOUNCING THE SENTENCE IN THE USUAL SOLEMN MANNER THE CONDEMNED MAN IS INVITED TO MAKE HIS FINAL SPEECH TO AVAIL HIMSELF AS IT WERE
6836-61803-0013_250-142276-0026 HE STARTS AT THE INVITATION FALLING AS IT DOES LIKE A DEATH KNELL UPON HIS EAR HE LOOKS WILDLY AROUND DESPAIRINGLY
6836-61803-0017_125-121124-0025 FOR SO STANDS THE ASSASSIN IN TEXAS HIS DEMEANOUR IS COMPLETELY CHANGED
6836-61803-0018_1246-124548-0043 OFT EXHIBITED IN BOLD BRUTAL BULLYISM HE LOOKS COWED AND CRAVEN AND NOT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD HE FEELS THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE THAT HE IS STANDING BY THE SIDE OF HIS COFFIN
6836-61803-0019_5393-19219-0046 ON THE EDGE OF AN ETERNITY TOO TERRIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE TO A CONSCIENCE LIKE HIS IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THAN APPALLING ALL AT ONCE A LIGHT IS SEEN TO FLASK INTO HIS EYES
6836-61803-0020_1116-137572-0018 SUNKEN AS THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF TWO LIVID CIRCLES HE HAS THE AIR OF ONE ON THE EVE OF MAKING CONFESSION IS IT TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUILT
6836-61803-0021_1334-135589-0020 IS HE ABOUT TO UNBURDEN HIS CONSCIENCE OF THE WEIGHT THAT MUST BE ON IT THE SPECTATORS GUESSING HIS INTENTION STAND BREATHLESSLY OBSERVING HIM THERE IS SILENCE EVEN AMONG THE CICADAS
6836-61803-0022_7278-91083-0013 IT IS BROKEN BY THE FORMALISED INTERROGATORY OF THE JUDGE HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY WHY SENTENCE OF DEATH SHOULD NOT BE PRONOUNCED UPON YOU NO HE REPLIES I HAVE NOT
6836-61803-0026_39-121916-0001 ONCE MORE IN THEIR MIDST BEYOND THESE SOUNDS SOON CEASING THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THE CONFESSION FROM BEING CONTINUED I KNOW THAT I'VE GOT TO DIE PROCEEDS THE PRISONER WITH AN AIR OF SEEMING RECKLESSNESS
6836-61803-0028_4788-294466-0001 IMPUTATION OF HAVING MURDERED MY OWN COUSIN I DID TAKE HIS LIFE AS I'VE TOLD YOU YOU ARE ALL ASKING WHY AND CONJECTURING ABOUT THE MOTIVE THERE WAS NONE
6836-61803-0029_6385-220959-0026 A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
6836-61803-0033_4406-16882-0052 CONTINUES HE I NEEDN'T THAT I INTENDED TO KILL SOME ONE I DID NOR AM I GOING TO DENY WHO IT WAS IT WAS THE CUR I SEE STANDING BEFORE ME IN A GLANCE OF CONCENTRATED HATRED
6836-61803-0035_198-209-0025 WHO ONLY ANSWERS WITH A LOOK SO CALM AS ALMOST TO BETRAY INDIFFERENCE YES I INTENDED TO KILL HIM I HAD MY REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THEY WERE IT'S NO USE NOW
6836-61803-0037_3240-131231-0013 EITHER ABOUT THE MURDER OR ITS MOTIVE AND THE PRISONER IS SPARED FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THAT FIENDISH DEED THAT LEFT THE DEAD BODY OF HENRY POINDEXTER WITHOUT A HEAD
6836-61803-0040_1081-128618-0004 TILL I'VE SENT HIM TO HIS I DON'T BY GOD THERE IS NO NEED TO GUESS AT THE MEANING OF THIS PROFANE SPEECH THE LAST OF CALHOUN'S LIFE ITS MEANING IS MADE CLEAR BY THE ACT THAT ACCOMPANIES IT
6836-61803-0041_3168-173565-0012 WHILE SPEAKING HE HAS KEPT HIS RIGHT HAND UNDER THE LEFT BREAST OF HIS COAT ALONG WITH THE OATH IT COMES FORTH HOLDING A REVOLVER THE SPECTATORS HAVE JUST TIME TO SEE THE PISTOL
6836-61803-0043_3830-12530-0016 THE CROWD CLOSES AROUND BELIEVING BOTH TO BE DEAD
6836-61804-0001_39-121914-0012 UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE TELLING US THAT FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER ARE ALL TO BE FORSAKEN FOR THAT LOVE ILLIMITABLE
6836-61804-0003_4813-248638-0052 NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0004_7264-92310-0031 HAD BEEN TRUE ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE FELT SURE OF IT BEFORE TURNING THE MUZZLE TOWARDS HIS OWN TEMPLES AND FIRING THE BULLET THAT HAD LODGED IN HIS BRAIN
6836-61804-0005_839-130898-0075 RIGHT OVER THE HEART HE HAD HIT HIS INTENDED VICTIM AND THROUGH THE HEART WOULD THE LEADEN MISSILE HAVE MADE ITS WAY
6836-61804-0008_3982-182255-0040 BUT NO LONGER LAY HIS BODY IN DANGER IN THE CHAPPARAL SURROUNDED BY WOLVES AND SHADOWED BY SOARING VULTURES IN A HUT WHERE HE WAS BUT ILL ATTENDED
6836-61804-0009_2843-152918-0061 IN A JAIL WHERE HE WAS SCARCE CARED FOR AT ALL WHEN AGAIN RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAIR VISION OF HIS DREAMS WAS NO VISION AT ALL BUT A LOVELY WOMAN
6836-61804-0011_6818-68772-0047 WHICH INSTEAD OF A NOBODY GAVE HIM A NOBLEMAN FOR HIS SON SUCH IN REALITY WAS SIR MAURICE GERALD ERST KNOWN AS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN TEXAS
6836-61804-0013_4340-15220-0000 IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
6836-61804-0014_248-130644-0027 FOR AFTER CALHOUN'S DEATH IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EX CAPTAIN HAD ONCE BEEN A BENEDICT AND THERE WAS A YOUNG SCION OF HIS STOCK LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS WHO HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY HE WAS HIS SON
6836-61804-0017_1624-142933-0025 TAKE POSSESSION OF HER SPIRIT AND THEN ONLY IN THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW SOON TO PASS AWAY IT WAS ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME TO THE HACIENDA BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE BODY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

6880-216547-0000_481-123719-0023 THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
6880-216547-0002_1723-141149-0022 YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR

6880-216547-0006_233-155990-0001 YOU CHANGED THIS FORMAL OFFER INTO AN INVIOLABLE AND SACRED OBLIGATION THENCEFORTH I UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW WORTHY AND HONORABLE A SOCIETY I HAD TO DEAL MY REGARD FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT MY RECOGNITION OF ITS BENEFITS
6880-216547-0007_4640-19188-0012 MY ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS GLORY WERE UNBOUNDED CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT IN ORDER TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE BEATEN PATHS OF OPINIONS AND SYSTEMS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN MY STUDY OF MAN AND SOCIETY
6880-216547-0008_8051-118101-0036 BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
6880-216547-0010_5463-39173-0048 IF IT DID NOT REVEAL THE ASTONISHING SUCCESS AT LEAST BORE WITNESS TO THE THOROUGHNESS OF MY LABORS SINCE THAT TIME METAPHYSICS AND MORAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN MY ONLY STUDIES
6880-216547-0014_5703-47198-0003 IS THE CHILD OF YOUR THOUGHT
6880-216547-0015_6454-120342-0005 TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
6880-216547-0016_1081-125237-0073 THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0017_6476-57446-0055 WHEN YOUR COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE COMPETITORS HAD ENUMERATED WITH EXACTNESS THE IMMEDIATE AND PARTICULAR CAUSES OF SUICIDE AS WELL AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING EACH OF THEM BUT THAT FROM THIS ENUMERATION
6880-216547-0021_103-1241-0027 THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION IN A CHRISTIAN TONGUE YOU ASKED GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0022_2159-179154-0015 WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
6880-216547-0024_4297-13009-0054 THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
6880-216547-0025_4160-14187-0017 THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0026_8630-305213-0043 THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR WERE NOTHING MORE THAN HYPOTHESES FINALLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0027_1455-138263-0031 THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY YOU PRESENTED FOR COMPETITION IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
6880-216547-0028_7190-90542-0080 THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0030_2691-156745-0007 CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0035_3526-176651-0005 HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
6880-216547-0036_8123-275216-0004 TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
6880-216547-0038_1183-133256-0023 BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
6880-216547-0039_7278-246956-0001 ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
6880-216547-0041_4340-15220-0052 IT WAS MY DUTY THIS BLAME RESULTS FROM THE FACTS WHICH I CALL ATTENTION TO WHY HAS THE CHURCH DECREED CONCERNING THINGS WHICH IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
6880-216547-0043_6019-3185-0099 TO RESTORE RELIGION GENTLEMEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN THE CHURCH PERHAPS YOU WILL REGRET GENTLEMEN THAT IN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO METHOD AND EVIDENCE
6880-216547-0045_3240-131231-0065 THAT IS THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY AMONG SO MANY MEN OF TALENT FRANCE TO DAY COUNTS NOT ONE GREAT WRITER
6880-216547-0046_909-131045-0016 IN A SOCIETY LIKE OURS TO SEEK FOR LITERARY GLORY SEEMS TO ME AN ANACHRONISM OF WHAT USE IS IT TO INVOKE AN ANCIENT SIBYL WHEN A MUSE IS ON THE EVE OF BIRTH
6880-216547-0049_1594-135914-0114 AND THE MOST PRECIOUS FRUIT THAT I COULD WISH TO GATHER FROM THIS MEMOIR WOULD BE THE INSPIRATION OF MY READERS WITH THAT TRANQUILLITY OF SOUL WHICH ARISES FROM THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF EVIL AND ITS CAUSE
6880-216547-0050_5339-14134-0056 AND WHICH IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM MY HATRED OF PRIVILEGE AND HUMAN AUTHORITY WAS UNBOUNDED PERHAPS AT TIMES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY IN MY INDIGNATION
6880-216547-0056_1963-142776-0023 THEY ASSEMBLE LIKE BEES AT THE SOUND OF A BASIN
6880-216547-0057_6476-57446-0011 MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
6880-216547-0058_6836-61804-0031 MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0060_89-219-0007 PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
6880-216547-0065_311-124404-0121 AFTER THIS LUDICROUS DECREE WHICH ITS AUTHORS THOUGHT TO RENDER POWERFUL BY GIVING IT THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION
6880-216547-0067_6019-3185-0086 WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
6880-216547-0068_6529-62556-0032 HONORED BY THE POWER WHICH HE SOUGHT TO ENLIGHTEN WITHOUT FLATTERING OR DISGRACING IT
6880-216547-0070_5652-39938-0018 AND SAVED ME FROM THE BLOWS OF A JUSTICE WHICH IS ALWAYS BLIND BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS IGNORANT
6880-216547-0071_40-121026-0018 A LETTER AS HONORABLE TO ITS AUTHOR AS IT IS FLATTERING TO HIM TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED PARIS MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE MONSIEUR
6880-216547-0073_289-121665-0026 THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
6880-216547-0074_87-121553-0069 THIS PROPOSITION NOW COMING INTO NOTICE PROPERTY IS ROBBERY WAS OF A NATURE TO REPEL FROM YOUR BOOK EVEN THOSE SERIOUS MINDS WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY APPEARANCES HAD YOU PERSISTED IN MAINTAINING IT
6880-216547-0075_233-134440-0049 IN ITS RUDE SIMPLICITY BUT IF YOU HAVE SOFTENED THE FORM YOU ARE NONE THE LESS FAITHFUL TO THE GROUND WORK OF YOUR DOCTRINES AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO GIVE ME A SHARE IN THIS PERILOUS TEACHING
6880-216547-0077_3947-13260-0039 NAMELY THAT ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY GET TOO FREQUENTLY ABUSED IN THIS WORLD BUT I DO NOT REASON FROM THE ABUSE TO THE ABOLITION AN HEROIC REMEDY TOO MUCH LIKE DEATH
6880-216547-0078_5789-70653-0036 WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
6880-216547-0085_60-121082-0011 AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
6880-216547-0086_1040-133433-0080 THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
6880-216547-0088_2911-15045-0011 I ACTUALLY PASSED TWO TERRIBLE NIGHTS AND I SUCCEEDED IN RESTRAINING THE SECULAR ARM ONLY BY SHOWING THAT YOUR BOOK WAS AN ACADEMICAL DISSERTATION AND NOT THE MANIFESTO OF AN INCENDIARY
6880-216547-0092_1263-141777-0036 BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
6880-216547-0093_6209-34600-0012 IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
6880-216547-0094_5688-41232-0009 THE TERMS BY WHICH YOU CHARACTERIZE THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REASSURE THE MOST SUSPICIOUS IMAGINATIONS AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS BUT YOU CONCLUDE
6880-216547-0095_8770-295462-0020 IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY YOU WISH TO ABOLISH THE MOST POWERFUL MOTOR OF THE HUMAN MIND YOU ATTACK THE PATERNAL SENTIMENT IN ITS SWEETEST ILLUSIONS WITH ONE WORD YOU ARREST THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL

6925-80680-0000_3723-171115-0012 ONE HOT NIGHT IN HINDUSTAN A KING AND QUEEN LAY AWAKE IN THE PALACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY EVERY NOW AND THEN A FAINT AIR BLEW THROUGH THE LATTICE AND THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP BUT THEY NEVER DID PRESENTLY THEY BECAME MORE BROAD AWAKE THAN EVER
6925-80680-0001_7148-59157-0021 AT THE SOUND OF A HOWL OUTSIDE THE PALACE LISTEN TO THAT TIGER REMARKED THE KING TIGER REPLIED THE QUEEN HOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIGER INSIDE THE CITY IT WAS ONLY A JACKAL I TELL YOU IT WAS A TIGER SAID THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
6925-80680-0007_6880-216547-0090 AND AWAY THE BEARERS WENT FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A DENSE WOOD
6925-80680-0008_2952-408-0011 AND STARTED HOME AGAIN NOW THE QUEEN THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT THE KING COULD NOT MEAN TO SEND HER AWAY FOR GOOD AND THAT AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT OVER HIS FIT OF TEMPER HE WOULD SUMMON HER BACK SO SHE STAYED QUITE STILL FOR A LONG TIME LISTENING WITH ALL HER EARS FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
6925-80680-0009_4267-78186-0009 BUT HEARD NONE AFTER A WHILE SHE GREW NERVOUS FOR SHE WAS ALL ALONE AND PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE PALANQUIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HER DAY WAS JUST BREAKING AND BIRDS AND INSECTS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR
6925-80680-0010_587-54108-0022 BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0011_298-126791-0027 WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED ALONE FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS AS IT WAS HOT WEATHER THE FARMER HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLAT ROOF OF HIS HOUSE BUT WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF WEEPING HE JUMPED UP AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS HE COULD AND INTO THE FOREST TOWARDS THE PLACE THE SOUND CAME FROM
6925-80680-0012_254-127705-0042 AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0015_445-123857-0016 AT LAST WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE THEY HAD NOT THE HEART TO FORBID HIM ANY LONGER
6925-80680-0016_7447-91187-0000 A BIG BRASS POT TO HOLD WATER A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
6925-80680-0019_2007-132570-0006 AND ON REACHING THE SPOT HE FOUND AN UGLY OLD WOMAN STREAMING WET AND CRYING LOUDLY AS SHE LIFTED FROM HER HEAD
6925-80680-0023_1963-142393-0052 COME TO WHERE YOU NOW STAND AND CRY FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOU THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE OLD WOMAN'S SAYING AND MUCH OF THE LOVELY DAMSEL
6925-80680-0027_426-122819-0005 SOON AFTER THIS ON A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE RIVER ROARED BENEATH THE PALACE WALLS THE SOUND OF A WOMAN WEEPING AND WAILING WAS HEARD ABOVE THE STORM THE KING ORDERED A SERVANT TO GO AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT THE SERVANT FALLING ON HIS KNEES IN TERROR
6925-80680-0033_4640-19188-0023 OR OF THE ROARING RIVER AS FOR GHOSTS AND WITCHES THEY HAD NEVER TROUBLED HIM SO HE WALKED UP TOWARDS THE GALLOWS WHERE CROUCHED THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN WHAT AILS YOU HE SAID NOW THE WOMAN WAS NOT REALLY A WOMAN AT ALL
6925-80680-0034_441-130108-0023 BUT A HORRID KIND OF WITCH WHO REALLY LIVED IN WITCHLAND AND HAD NO BUSINESS ON EARTH IF EVER A MAN STRAYED INTO WITCHLAND THE OGRESSES USED TO EAT HIM UP AND THIS OLD WITCH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A MAN FOR SUPPER
6925-80680-0038_7780-274562-0091 BUT AMEER ALI GAVE A SWEEP UPWARDS WITH HIS SHARP SWORD TO CUT THE ROPE THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ROUND HIS NECK
6925-80680-0040_412-126975-0069 AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
6925-80680-0042_5393-19219-0060 NOW IN THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE PALACE THERE HUNG TWO CAGES IN ONE OF WHICH WAS A PARROT AND IN THE OTHER A STARLING AND THESE TWO BIRDS COULD TALK AS WELL AS HUMAN BEINGS THEY WERE BOTH PETS OF THE PRINCESS WHO ALWAYS FED THEM HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY AS SHE WAS
6925-80680-0044_6385-34655-0024 THAT WAS THE PARROT'S NAME HOW DO YOU THINK THE PRINCESS LOOKS IN HER NEW JEWEL THINK SNAPPED THE PARROT WHO WAS CROSS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T GIVEN HIM HIS BATH THAT MORNING I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER WITH ONE SHOE ON AND THE OTHER OFF
6925-80680-0047_6531-61334-0055 OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
6925-80680-0048_3699-47246-0004 AND INQUIRED OF EVERYONE WHERE THE FINEST JEWELS WERE TO BE GOT BUT THOUGH HE SOUGHT NIGHT AND DAY HE NEVER FOUND ONE TO COMPARE WITH THE ANKLET AT LAST ONLY A WEEK REMAINED AND HE WAS IN SORE DIFFICULTY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE FAIRY OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0050_374-180299-0030 THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
6925-80680-0054_7800-283492-0009 AT LENGTH SHE PERSUADED HIM TO DO HER BIDDING HE NEARLY FAINTED HIMSELF WITH HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT AFTER THE CRUEL BLOW WHICH LOPPED HER FOOT OFF SHE LAY AS ONE LIFELESS BUT HE HELD THE SEVERED FOOT OVER THE CAULDRON AND AS DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM IT
6925-80680-0056_1578-6379-0004 THEN THE MAIDEN OPENED HER EYES SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DRAWING HER VEIL ABOUT HER RAN INTO THE HUT AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OR SPEAK TO HIM ANY MORE
6925-80680-0057_7635-105409-0052 BUT THREE RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ANKLETS AND THESE HE DULY PRESENTED TO THE KING ON THE VERY DAY THAT HIS MONTH OF GRACE WAS OVER THE KING EMBRACED HIM WARMLY AND MADE HIM RICH GIFTS AND THE NEXT DAY THE VAIN PRINCESS PUT TWO ANKLETS ON EACH FOOT
6925-80680-0058_7635-105409-0015 AND STRUTTED UP AND DOWN IN THEM ADMIRING HERSELF IN THE MIRRORS THAT LINED HER ROOM
6925-80680-0061_7859-102519-0005 AND THEN SHE DECLARED TO HER FATHER THAT UNLESS SHE HAD BRACELETS AND NECKLACE TO MATCH THE ANKLETS SHE WOULD DIE AGAIN THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND ORDERED HIM TO GET A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS TO MATCH THOSE ANKLETS WITHIN A MONTH OR BE PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH
6925-80680-0063_78-368-0053 ONCE MORE THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN APPEARED AT HIS SUMMONS AND ASKED WHAT HE WANTED
6925-80680-0066_1235-135884-0028 THEN THE HEAD AND HANDS WERE JOINED ON TO THE BODY AND LEFT NEITHER SIGN NOR SCAR FULL OF GRATITUDE AMEER ALI TRIED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND WOULD NOT COME BACK AND HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE HER
6925-80680-0068_5703-47212-0028 THE VERY NEXT MORNING SHE PUT ON ALL HER FINERY AND THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LEAST THAT DISAGREEABLE PARROT COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH HER APPEARANCE AND SHE LISTENED EAGERLY WHEN SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY
6925-80680-0069_4406-16883-0058 HOW DO YOU THINK OUR PRINCESS IS LOOKING NOW VERY FINE NO DOUBT GRUMBLED THE PARROT BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF DRESSING UP LIKE THAT FOR ONESELF ONLY SHE OUGHT TO HAVE A HUSBAND WHY DOESN'T SHE MARRY THE MAN WHO GOT HER ALL THESE SPLENDID THINGS
6925-80680-0073_2384-152900-0072 AMEER ALI WAS INSTANTLY THROWN INTO THE MOST DISMAL PRISON THAT THEY COULD FIND AND ORDERED TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL THE KING HAD TIME TO THINK IN WHAT WAY HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCESS OUGHT IN ANY CASE TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY
6925-80680-0074_1963-142393-0001 SO HE SENT FORTH HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES PROCLAIMING THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY ANY PERSON FITTED FOR A BRIDEGROOM AND HEIR TO THE THRONE SHOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE PALACE WHEN THE DAY CAME ALL THE COURT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
6925-80680-0075_6437-66172-0003 WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANYONE ELSE TO GAIN BOTH THE THRONE AND THE PRINCESS AS SOON AS THE KING WAS SEATED HE CALLED UPON AN USHER TO SUMMON THE FIRST CLAIMANT BUT JUST THEN A FARMER WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CROWD CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD A PETITION TO OFFER
6925-80680-0079_441-128982-0026 TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
6925-80680-0083_211-122425-0025 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I WILL MARRY SAID HE AND THIS TIME THE MAIDEN DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT AGREED TO BE HIS WIFE SO THE TWO WERE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY AND LIVED LONG AND REIGNED HAPPILY AS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE PITCHER AMEER ALI HAD BROKEN
6925-80680-0084_1867-154071-0018 SHE WAS THE FOREST MAIDEN'S FAIRY GODMOTHER AND WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED TO LOOK AFTER THE GIRL SHE GLADLY RETURNED TO FAIRYLAND THE OLD KING HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD TO CONTRADICT HIS WIFE ANY MORE IF HE EVEN LOOKS AS IF HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH HER
696-92939-0000_87-121553-0015 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE EDITH CAVELL AS THE NAME OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE BECAME WORLD FAMOUS AT THE CLOSE OF THE CRIMEAN WAR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO THE NAME OF ANOTHER ENGLISH NURSE WHO SUFFERED MARTYRDOM IN THE WORLD WAR
696-92939-0001_1963-147036-0013 WILL GO DOWN INTO HISTORY WITH THE LUSTRE OF GLORY AND SELF SACRIFICE SURROUNDING IT THAT NAME IS EDITH CAVELL EDITH CAVELL WAS BORN AT SWARDESTON IN NORWICH ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
696-92939-0002_3982-182255-0036 HER FATHER WAS AN ENGLISH MINISTER OF THE OLD SCHOOL WHO WAS RECTOR OF A SINGLE PARISH IN NORWICH FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY EDITH AND HER SISTER WERE BROUGHT UP IN STRICT CONFORMANCE WITH CHURCH IDEAS

696-92939-0007_2952-410-0049 AND AT FIRST THEY WERE INCLINED TO LOOK UPON MISS CAVELL AS AN UNTRAINED OUTSIDER BUT HER TACT EFFICIENCY AND SKILL SOON WON THE HEARTS OF THESE GOOD WOMEN WHO AFFORDED HER EVERY COURTESY AND ENTERED INTO CORDIAL COOPERATION WITH HER
696-92939-0010_441-128982-0015 WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED MISS CAVELL LOST NO TIME IN HURRYING BACK TO BRUSSELS BELIEVING THAT HER DUTY CALLED HER THERE SHE WROTE A LETTER COMMENTING ON THE GERMAN ARMY WHEN IT SWEPT THROUGH BELGIUM AND IN IT SHE VOICED HER PITY FOR THE TIRED FOOTSORE GERMAN SOLDIERS
696-92939-0014_6078-54007-0011 BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
696-92939-0017_5104-33406-0011 A BLOW WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE WHEN SHE TRIED TO EXPOSTULATE SHE WAS TAKEN TO PRISON AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HER ARREST WAS SHROUDED WITH THE MOST CAREFUL SECRECY FOR THE GERMANS DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NEUTRAL GOVERNMENTS

696-92939-0021_3982-178459-0040 FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSED AT ANY TIME OF HAVING BEEN A SPY BUT THEY HAD PLANNED TO TRY HER FOR HER LIFE AND MISTER WHITLOCK SOON GUESSED THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR PREPARATIONS FROM HIM SO FAR AS POSSIBLE

696-92939-0024_150-126112-0035 AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP THEM INFORMED OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE ALL THESE PROMISES WERE BROKEN IT IS TRUE THAT HE SENT A NOTE A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL TELLING MISTER WHITLOCK THAT THE CASE WAS ABOUT TO COME TO COURT
696-92939-0026_198-209-0030 WAS CALM DIGNIFIED AND BRAVE AT THE TRIAL AND FACED HER ACCUSERS HEROICALLY SHE WAS DRESSED IN HER NURSE'S UNIFORM AND WORE THE BADGE OF THE RED CROSS WHEN MISTER WHITLOCK LEARNED THAT SHE HAD BEEN TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH

696-92939-0036_8063-274116-0036 AND IN MISS CAVELL'S HOME TOWN EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN WAS SWORN INTO THE ARMY A BITTER DENUNCIATION OF THE GERMAN ACT WAS MADE BY SIR EDWARD GREY THE GERMANS THEMSELVES HAD ONLY A POOR EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE
696-92939-0038_3235-28433-0003 SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
696-92939-0039_4813-248638-0040 AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES

696-93314-0019_4680-16041-0038 HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
696-93314-0022_887-123290-0009 THE LOVER WHO CAME TO HIS LOVE OVER STREWN WALLFLOWERS DESIRED ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SEEN TO ACT UP TO HIS MORAL IDEAS SO HE TOOK NEXT DAY A MUCH EARLIER TRAIN THAN WAS AT ALL PLEASANT

696-93314-0024_2182-150130-0024 ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
696-93314-0025_4018-103416-0009 FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
696-93314-0027_5192-19397-0045 HE ONLY CONSENTED TO A PROVISIONAL ENGAGEMENT TOOK AN EARNEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN'S AFFAIRS AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIS DAUGHTER AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE ON HER MARRIAGE AT MY DEATH SHE WILL HAVE MORE HE SAID
696-93314-0030_7264-92316-0000 BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
696-93314-0040_6880-216547-0061 YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU I DIDN'T KNOW AND OH WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING YET THEY TALKED FOR HOURS CONVENTIONALLY HE SHOULD HAVE TORN HIMSELF AWAY UNABLE TO BEAR THE STRAIN OF HIS AGONY

696-93314-0049_4898-20016-0034 COVERING A CLEAR CUT MASK OF SET ENDURANCE AND THERE WAS NO WORK THAT COULD SHUT OUT THAT SIGHT NO TEMPTATION OF THE WORLD THE FLESH OR THE DEVIL TO GIVE HIM EVEN THE RELIEF OF A FIGHT HE HAD NO TEMPTATIONS HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE
696-93314-0053_250-142286-0010 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0056_7794-295955-0021 IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
696-93314-0057_3214-167602-0004 BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES

7067-76048-0046_8425-246962-0016 HE WOULD REFLECT AS HE HESITATED OVER THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS LIFE'S IDEAL THERE WAS HETTY GREEN THIS LATTER IDEA HAD REFT HER SUDDENLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN FROM THE EDUCATIONAL CARE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN WARRANTED TO FIT HER FOR MARRIAGE WITH ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
7067-76048-0048_7402-59171-0011 SHE HAD WORKED FOR ORDINARY WAGES AND ORDINARY HOURS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE MENTIONED CASUALLY A LARGE AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO MENSERVANTS
7067-76048-0049_2416-152139-0001 THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
7067-76048-0051_3982-178459-0045 AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
7067-76048-0052_1926-143879-0027 MISTER LAKE HAD BEEN RATHER HARDLY USED AND HAD ACQUIRED MERIT BY HIS BEHAVIOUR UNDER BAD TREATMENT THERE WAS SOME STORY HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH HER WAR SERVICES IN EUROPE UPON WHICH MISS GRAMMONT WAS EVIDENTLY INDISPOSED TO DWELL
7067-76048-0053_8580-287364-0012 STILL QUITE VAGUELY GUESSING SO MUCH FACT ABOUT MISS GRAMMONT AS WE HAVE GIVEN HAD FLOATED UP IN FRAGMENTS AND PIECED ITSELF TOGETHER IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND IN THE COURSE OF A DAY AND A HALF THE FRAGMENTS CAME UP AS ALLUSIONS OR BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION
7067-76048-0054_1970-10594-0021 THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
7067-76048-0056_4014-186179-0046 BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0057_3807-4923-0000 AND IT THROWS THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT IT INTO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A COMMON ENTERPRISE TO MORROW THE NEW AGE WILL BE HERE NO DOUBT BUT TODAY IT IS THE HOPE AND ADVENTURE OF ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL FOR MISS GRAMMONT AND SIR RICHMOND TO ASK
7067-76048-0060_1081-125237-0031 AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
7078-271888-0000_2196-170151-0026 WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
7078-271888-0003_3486-166424-0047 BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
7078-271888-0004_6209-34601-0030 OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
7078-271888-0005_6818-76332-0051 UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
7078-271888-0007_27-123349-0020 IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
7078-271888-0008_3857-182315-0015 HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
7078-271888-0009_5339-14134-0034 HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
7078-271888-0010_2843-152918-0082 AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
7078-271888-0011_5192-19397-0041 THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
7078-271888-0013_229-130880-0027 AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
7078-271888-0014_8419-293469-0022 BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
7078-271888-0018_5678-43302-0021 BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
7078-271888-0024_83-11691-0020 AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0026_40-121026-0040 YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
7078-271888-0031_2289-152254-0010 SO MAKING AN EXCUSE I BADE THEM AU REVOIR AND RETURNED TO MY OWN BOOK LINED DEN UNLOCKING A DRAWER IN MY WRITING TABLE I TOOK OUT A PACKET OF LETTERS THAT STILL EMITTED A STALE ODOUR OF VIOLETS

7078-271888-0057_1363-135842-0002 PERFECTLY SATISFYING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HERSELF OUT OF THE WORLD EVEN WELCOME OLD FELLOW DICK CRIED

7078-271888-0061_8609-262281-0030 HE WAS SUCH A LARGE HEARTED HONEST FELLOW THAT I FELT QUITE PAINED WHEN I ANTICIPATED THE AWAKENING THAT MUST INEVITABLY COME SOONER OR LATER HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER PAST AND WAS QUITE IGNORANT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A POPULAR ACTRESS
7078-271888-0062_5678-43303-0002 IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
7078-271888-0063_3374-298032-0038 THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
7078-271888-0064_7264-92316-0025 I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS
7078-271888-0065_118-124588-0002 HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM

7078-271888-0076_2196-170151-0027 A SCRAP OF CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER CAUSED ME TO PONDER AN ELDERLY MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER WEARING THE VIOLET RIBBON OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
7078-271888-0081_730-358-0020 A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN

7078-271888-0087_730-358-0033 AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
7078-271888-0090_7059-88364-0014 THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
7078-271888-0093_7511-102420-0026 TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
7078-271888-0096_460-172359-0081 AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE

7078-271888-0104_7505-258964-0013 AND CONGRATULATED DICK WARMLY UPON HIS MASTERPIECE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE MEANT TO SECURE IT AT ANY COST

7078-271888-0112_2416-152139-0052 BUT BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL LIFE WAS EXTINCT THE COUNT IS INSANE WITH GRIEF MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MAID DISCOVERED THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD LEFT A LETTER TO SOME MAN SHE CALLS DICK TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
7078-271888-0114_4481-17498-0027 IN THE PRIVATE GALLERY OF HIS GREAT PALACE IN ROME LITTLE DREAMING THAT

7113-86041-0017_1737-146161-0006 WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THIS HE FLEW DOWN AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY INTO THE THICKET AND TOOK THE FORM OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT WAS THE BEST WAY AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL THEN AND THERE
7113-86041-0021_7190-90542-0058 WEAVING HIS MAGIC SPELLS TILL SLOWLY ALL ABOUT HIM CHANGED AND WHEN THE MAIDENS RETURNED AT NOON TO THEIR FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE THEY STOOD LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND ALMOST FANCIED THAT THEY MUST BE DREAMING

7113-86041-0033_7226-86964-0060 THE KING WAS SO MUCH PERPLEXED THAT HE THREATENED THE PRINCESS'S PLAYFELLOWS WITH ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS IF THEY WOULD NOT CONFESS SOMETHING ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT AS THEY ONLY REPEATED THE SAME STORY HE PRESENTLY PUT DOWN THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE WORK OF SOME
7113-86041-0034_1334-135589-0044 SPRITE OR GOBLIN AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HIS LOSS BY ORDERING A GRAND HUNT FOR KINGS CANNOT BEAR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT ANYTHING LONG MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY

7113-86041-0066_6454-120342-0014 AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
7113-86041-0067_4830-25904-0032 AND THEN WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PUPPETS TO PLAY WITH ALMOST BEFORE THE GNOME HAD FINISHED THE DISAPPOINTED PRINCESS TURNED AWAY AND MARCHED OFF TO HER OWN APARTMENTS WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER HIM THE GNOME HOWEVER
7113-86041-0068_5192-19397-0082 AND DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A FARMER BOUGHT AN ASS IN THE NEAREST MARKET TOWN AND BROUGHT IT BACK LOADED WITH SACKS OF TURNIP CARROT AND RADISH SEED WITH THIS HE SOWED A GREAT FIELD
7113-86041-0070_4362-15663-0057 HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
7113-86041-0071_1624-142933-0041 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING OF THEIR WEDDING DAY WHEN THE BRIDE'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE TOOK PLACE THE SAD NEWS DROVE RATIBOR DISTRACTED AND AS THE DAYS WENT ON AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THE PRINCESS HE FORSOOK HIS CASTLE
7113-86041-0072_7067-76048-0010 AND THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND SPENT HIS DAYS IN THE WILD FORESTS ROAMING ABOUT AND CRYING HER NAME ALOUD TO THE TREES AND ROCKS MEANWHILE THE MAIDEN IN HER GORGEOUS PRISON SIGHED IN SECRET OVER HER GRIEF NOT WISHING TO AROUSE THE GNOME'S SUSPICIONS
7113-86041-0076_374-180299-0016 SO THE BEE SPREAD HIS SHINING WINGS AND FLEW AWAY TO DO AS HE WAS BIDDEN BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT A GREEDY SWALLOW MADE A SNATCH AT HIM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS HER MESSENGER WAS EATEN UP
7113-86041-0077_1069-133709-0026 THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
7113-86041-0078_3259-158083-0121 BUT THAT I AM HELD CAPTIVE BY THE GNOME IN HIS PALACE UNDER THE MOUNTAINS SO THE CRICKET HOPPED OFF GAILY DETERMINED TO DO HIS BEST TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE BUT ALAS A LONG LEGGED STORK WHO WAS PRANCING ALONG THE SAME ROAD
7113-86041-0079_254-127705-0014 CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
7113-86041-0080_3807-4955-0000 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0081_2691-156755-0036 AND BID HIM COME WITH HORSES AND MEN THE THIRD DAY FROM THIS TO THE HILL THAT RISES FROM THE THORNY VALLEY THE MAGPIE LISTENED HOPPED AWHILE FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AND THEN DARTED AWAY
7113-86041-0082_8425-292520-0010 NOW PRINCE RATIBOR WAS STILL SPENDING HIS LIFE IN WANDERING ABOUT THE WOODS AND NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE SPRING COULD SOOTHE HIS GRIEF ONE DAY AS HE SAT IN THE SHADE OF AN OAK TREE DREAMING OF HIS LOST PRINCESS AND SOMETIMES CRYING HER NAME ALOUD
7113-86041-0083_4397-15668-0006 WHICH BELONGS TO AN UNLUCKY MORTAL WHO WISHES THE EARTH WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS MEMORY FOR EVER THEREUPON HE CAUGHT UP A GREAT STONE
7113-86041-0086_911-128684-0087 ALL HIS GLOOM AND MISERY VANISHED IN A MOMENT AND HE ANXIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE WELCOME MESSENGER AS TO THE FATE OF THE PRINCESS BUT THE MAGPIE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNT SO HE SOON FLUTTERED AWAY
7113-86041-0088_311-124404-0000 SHE LEFT OFF TREATING THE GNOME WITH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE INDEED THERE WAS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY RETURN HIS LOVE AND THE IDEA PLEASED HIM MIGHTILY THE NEXT DAY
7113-86041-0092_839-130898-0098 EVERY TEAR OF YOURS FALLS UPON MY HEART LIKE A DROP OF MOLTEN GOLD GREATLY AS I DESIRE YOUR LOVE I DO NOT ASK A SACRIFICE AH CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS WHY DO YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY TEARS
7113-86041-0093_196-122150-0037 AND YET I AM FEARFUL A WIFE CANNOT ALWAYS CHARM AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER ALTER THE BEAUTY OF MORTALS IS AS A FLOWER THAT FADES HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AS LOVING AND CHARMING AS YOU ARE NOW
7113-86041-0094_78-368-0045 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0095_83-9960-0031 THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
7113-86041-0097_426-122821-0005 THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
7113-86041-0099_1334-135589-0057 WHICH SHE CHANGED INTO A SPIRITED HORSE ALL SADDLED AND BRIDLED AND SPRINGING UPON ITS BACK SHE GALLOPED AWAY OVER HILL AND DALE TILL SHE REACHED THE THORNY VALLEY AND FLUNG HERSELF
7113-86041-0102_3982-178459-0005 AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
7113-86041-0103_4788-94904-0039 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
7113-86041-0104_6385-34669-0021 ECHO ANSWERED IN THE MARBLE HALLS THERE WAS NEITHER VOICE NOR FOOTSTEP THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND THROWING OFF THE MORTAL FORM THAT ENCUMBERED HIM HE FLEW OUT OF THE PALACE
7113-86041-0105_2384-152900-0056 AND SOARED HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SAW THE FUGITIVE PRINCESS IN THE FAR DISTANCE JUST AS THE SWIFT HORSE CARRIED HER ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF HIS DOMINIONS FURIOUSLY
7113-86041-0106_1098-133695-0047 AND HURL A THUNDERBOLT AFTER THE FLYING MAIDEN SPLINTERING THE ROCKY BARRIERS WHICH HAD STOOD A THOUSAND YEARS BUT HIS FURY WAS VAIN THE THUNDERCLOUDS MELTED AWAY INTO A SOFT MIST
7113-86041-0107_7067-76048-0004 AND THE GNOME AFTER FLYING ABOUT FOR A WHILE IN DESPAIR BEWAILING TO THE FOUR WINDS HIS UNHAPPY FATE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE PALACE AND STOLE ONCE MORE THROUGH EVERY ROOM WITH MANY SIGHS AND LAMENTATIONS
7113-86041-0108_7367-86737-0003 HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
7113-86041-0110_6209-34601-0008 TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
7148-59157-0011_2691-156745-0035 TILL THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND AFTERWARDS ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND GUY'S HOSPITAL AS A MEDICAL STUDENT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CREDIT THE ACCEPTED STORY THAT HE PASSED ALL HIS BOYHOOD WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT
7148-59157-0012_839-130898-0060 AT WRITING POETRY HE DID NOT BEGIN TO WRITE SAYS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN TILL HE WAS NEAR EIGHTEEN
7148-59157-0014_2136-5140-0009 WITH HIS GENIUS BEFORE THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN HE MET FANNY BRAWNE FOR THE FIRST TIME NONE THE LESS HAD HE DIED BEFORE THAT DATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED IN LITERATURE NOT AS A MARVELLOUS ORIGINAL ARTIST
7148-59157-0015_911-128684-0065 SHE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY HIS GOOD FAIRY AS A POET THIS IS THE ONLY MATTER UPON WHICH ONE IS SERIOUSLY DISPOSED TO QUARREL WITH SIR SIDNEY COLVIN AS A BIOGRAPHER HE DOES NOT EMPHASIZE AS HE OUGHT THE DEBT WE ARE UNDER TO FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0016_6529-62554-0049 AS THE INTENSIFIER OF KEATS'S GENIUS THE MINX AS KEATS IRRITABLY CALLED HER WHO TRANSFORMED HIM IN A FEW MONTHS FROM A POET OF STILL DOUBTFUL FAME INTO A MASTER AND AN IMMORTAL THE ATTACHMENT
7148-59157-0020_1263-138246-0035 IN OTHER WORDS PRACTICALLY ALL THE FINE GOLD OF KEATS'S WORK WAS PRODUCED IN THE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR FANNY BRAWNE WAS CONSUMING HIM AS WITH FIRE HIS GREATEST POEMS WE CLEARLY OWE TO THAT HEIGHTENED SENSE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0025_1970-26100-0017 WAS NOT TO BE A HAPPY LOVER BUT THE SLAVE OF A MINX IT WAS NOT A SLAVERY WITHOUT DIGNITY HOWEVER IT HAD THE DIGNITY OF TRAGEDY
7148-59157-0027_1355-39947-0096 HAS ALMOST NO COUNTERPART IN BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING MISS BRAWNE HE WRITES TO BROWN FROM YARMOUTH IS BEYOND EVERYTHING HORRIBLE THE SENSE OF DARKNESS COMING OVER ME
7148-59157-0028_26-495-0050 I ETERNALLY SEE HER FIGURE ETERNALLY VANISHING AND WHEN HE REACHES NAPLES HE WRITES TO THE SAME FRIEND I CAN BEAR TO DIE I CANNOT BEAR TO LEAVE HER O GOD
7148-59157-0029_40-121026-0008 MY IMAGINATION IS HORRIBLY VIVID ABOUT HER I SEE HER I HEAR HER O THAT I COULD BE BURIED NEAR WHERE SHE LIVES I AM AFRAID TO WRITE TO HER
7148-59157-0030_6078-54013-0071 TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM HER TO SEE HER HANDWRITING WOULD BREAK MY HEART EVEN TO HEAR OF HER ANYHOW TO SEE HER NAME WRITTEN WOULD BE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
7148-59157-0031_5867-48852-0048 SANS MERCI SIR SIDNEY IS ALL IN FAVOUR AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR HIS PREFERENCE OF THE EARLIER VERSION WHICH BEGINS O WHAT CAN AIL THEE KNIGHT AT ARMS ALONE AND PALELY LOITERING
7148-59157-0032_289-121652-0003 BUT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE REASONS THAT LED KEATS TO ALTER THIS IN THE VERSION HE PUBLISHED IN LEIGH HUNT'S INDICATOR TO AH WHAT CAN AIL THEE WRETCHED WIGHT AND SO ON
7148-59157-0033_6454-107462-0034 TO ACCUSE HUNT OF WISHING TO ALTER KNIGHT AT ARMS TO WRETCHED WIGHT SEEMS TO ME UNWARRANTABLE GUESSING SURELY A MUCH MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT KEATS
7148-59157-0037_248-130652-0010 HIS MORBIDNESS HIS MAWKISHNESS HIS FASCINATION AS BY SERPENTS ON THE OTHER BUT IN THE RESULTANT PORTRAIT IT IS A TOO RESPECTABLE AND VIRILE KEATS THAT EMERGES KEATS WAS MORE VIRILE AS A MAN
7148-59157-0041_5322-7678-0015 IT WILL BE BUT A SOUNDING FUNERAL SPEECH INSTEAD OF COMMUNION WITH A LOVELY AND BROKEN SPIRIT
7148-7763-0000_8095-274346-0043 CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY ONE STAGE ONWARD FOR SOME YEARS AFTER THIS TIME I WROTE VERY LITTLE AND NOTHING REGULARLY FOR PUBLICATION AND GREAT WERE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE INTERMISSION
7148-7763-0003_39-121914-0053 IN THIS ENTERPRISE I ENDEAVOURED TO PICK UP AS MANY FLOWERS AS I COULD BY THE WAY
7148-7763-0004_6385-220959-0003 BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0005_6181-216552-0022 THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-7763-0011_4267-78186-0000 IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0014_2182-181183-0014 I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
7148-7763-0015_2843-152918-0076 AND I SAW NO USE IN GIVING HIM THE PAIN OF THINKING THAT HIS PLANS HAD FAILED WHEN THE FAILURE WAS PROBABLY IRREMEDIABLE AND AT ALL EVENTS BEYOND THE POWER OF
7148-7763-0016_302-123516-0011 HIS REMEDIES OF OTHER FRIENDS I HAD AT THAT TIME NONE TO WHOM I HAD ANY HOPE OF MAKING MY CONDITION INTELLIGIBLE IT WAS HOWEVER ABUNDANTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF
7148-7763-0025_2092-145706-0044 AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0026_3235-28433-0047 THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
7148-7763-0027_8123-275193-0025 WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
7148-7763-0028_6415-116629-0026 ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
7148-7763-0029_8465-246947-0003 TO COHERE MORE AND MORE CLOSELY IN OUR THOUGHTS ANALYTIC HABITS MAY THUS EVEN STRENGTHEN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSES AND EFFECTS MEANS AND ENDS BUT TEND ALTOGETHER TO WEAKEN THOSE WHICH ARE
7148-7763-0032_7800-283493-0007 HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP

7178-34645-0016_6415-111615-0026 JAMES THE SECOND A MAN COMMITS A BAD ACTION AND PLACES HIS MARK UPON IT TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CRIME BY EFFRONTERY TO DENOUNCE HIMSELF TO CLING TO HIS MISDEEDS IS THE INSOLENT BRAVADO OF THE CRIMINAL
7178-34645-0017_4813-248641-0040 CHRISTINA SEIZED MONALDESCHI HAD HIM CONFESSED AND ASSASSINATED AND SAID I AM THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF FRANCE

7178-34645-0032_3440-171006-0027 IF A DROWNED MAN IS CAST UP BY THE WATER AND IS NOT DEAD IT IS AN ACT OF GOD READJUSTING ONE OF THE KING IF THE HEIR BE FOUND LET THE CORONET BE GIVEN BACK TO HIM
7178-34645-0033_4340-15220-0020 THUS SHOULD BE DONE TO GWYNPLAINE WHO IS ALSO A KING SEEING THAT HE IS A PEER

7178-34645-0036_4397-15668-0036 MISCALLED GWYNPLAINE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH THE CRIMINAL HARDQUANONNE AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME AND ON THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR AS CONSTITUTIONAL KEEPER OF THE ROYAL CONSCIENCE
7178-34645-0037_3807-4923-0041 BASED THE ROYAL DECISION THE LORD CHANCELLOR ADDED IN A POSTSCRIPT
7178-34645-0038_118-124588-0019 FOR IF THE PRISONER DIES ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY THE CONFRONTATION BECOMES DIFFICULT STILL THE LAW MUST BE OBEYED
7190-90542-0004_4853-29413-0028 BUT THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE PROFESSOR QUARLES PERSISTED IN REMAINING IN THE BACKGROUND IF I DID THE SPADE WORK THE DEDUCTIONS WERE HIS THEY WERE ALL CASES WITH PECULIAR FEATURES IN THEM
7190-90542-0007_8609-283227-0009 BY EVENING THE CLOUDS HAD GONE THE MOON SAILED IN A CLEAR SKY AND LOOKING ROUND TO FIND THE CAUSE OF HIS HORSE'S UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR THE FARMER SAW A MAN LYING ON A HEAP OF SNOW UNDER THE OPPOSITE HEDGE HE WAS DEAD MORE HE WAS HEADLESS
7190-90542-0009_1034-121119-0053 NOR ANY PAPERS IN HIS POCKETS TO LEAD TO HIS IDENTIFICATION SO FAR AS COULD BE ASCERTAINED
7190-90542-0010_2952-407-0011 AND APPARENTLY NO STRUGGLE HAD TAKEN PLACE FOOTPRINTS NEARLY OBLITERATED
7190-90542-0011_8580-287364-0029 SOON AFTER THE STORM BEGAN AND THAT SNOW HAD HIDDEN THE MURDERER'S TRACKS FROM THE WOOD THAT SNOW HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE DEAD BODY SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THIS THEORY
7190-90542-0012_163-122947-0035 AND WOULD BE FOUND BURIED IN THE WOOD IT WAS NOT FOUND HOWEVER AND THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON PANIC FOR A FEW DAYS THE WITHAN MURDER SEEMED UNIQUE IN ATROCITIES AND THEN CAME A COMMUNICATION FROM THE FRENCH POLICE
7190-90542-0022_7178-34644-0014 THERE WAS A MOON THAT NIGHT WASN'T THERE FULL OR NEAR IT I RETURNED AND HOW SOON WAS THE ALARM RAISED ALONG THE COUNTRYSIDE
7190-90542-0024_1723-141149-0014 SAID ZENA AND IF HE WERE MET ON THE ROAD CARRYING A BAG HE WOULD ARREST ATTENTION WHY CARRYING A BAG ASKED QUARLES WITH THE HEAD IN IT SHE ANSWERED THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT WIGAN CHUCKLED QUARLES OF COURSE
7190-90542-0027_4898-28461-0013 A MAD DOCTOR BENT ON BRAIN EXPERIMENTS IS THAT YOUR THEORY WIGAN
7190-90542-0028_3830-12531-0017 JANUARY THE SEVENTEENTH NEARLY THE SAME DATE AS THE ENGLISH ONE SAID ZENA TWO YEARS INTERVENING I RETURNED
7190-90542-0029_6880-216547-0051 AT THAT DATE SAID QUARLES YOU HAVE A THEORY PROFESSOR AN OUTLANDISH ONE WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH NO NO I DO NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT I NEVER MENTION MY THEORIES UNTIL I HAVE SOME FACTS TO SUPPORT THEM
7190-90542-0031_3486-166424-0019 A FEW DAYS LATER QUARLES TELEGRAPHED ME TO MEET HIM AT KINGS CROSS AND WE TRAVELED NORTH TOGETHER WAIT HE SAID WHEN I BEGAN TO QUESTION HIM I AM NOT SURE YET MY THEORY SEEMS ABSURD WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IF IT IS
7190-90542-0033_1034-121119-0012 THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE ARRANGED A DRIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WITHAN BUT WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND PRESENTLY QUARLES STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
7190-90542-0034_7517-100429-0007 FIVE OR SIX MILES THE ROAD WINDS A LOT IT'S A DEAL NEARER AS THE CROW FLIES YOU NEED NOT WAIT FOR US DRIVER MY FRIEND AND I ARE GOING TO WALK BACK THE COACHMAN POCKETED HIS MONEY AND DROVE AWAY COULDN'T KEEP HIM WAITING ALL NIGHT AS WE MAY HAVE TO DO
7190-90542-0040_6531-61334-0066 WHETHER HE HAD STUDIED THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD I CANNOT SAY BUT HE DID NOT HESITATE IN HIS DIRECTION UNTIL HE REACHED A HIGH KNOLL WHICH WAS CLEAR OF THE WOOD AND COMMANDED A CONSIDERABLE VIEW WE WERE TRESPASSERS IN A PRIVATE PARK
7190-90542-0041_6367-65536-0053 TO OUR RIGHT WAS A LARGE HOUSE ONLY PARTIALLY SEEN THROUGH ITS SCREEN OF TREES BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY MELLOW WITH AGE TO OUR LEFT TOWARD WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXTREMITY OF THE PARK WAS HILLY GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN WILD
7190-90542-0042_2416-152139-0069 TO THIS QUARLES POINTED THAT IS OUR WAY HE SAID WE'LL USE WHAT COVER WE CAN WE PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD AGAIN AND WERE SOON IN THE WILDERNESS FORCING OUR WAY SOMETIMES WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH
7190-90542-0043_887-123291-0021 ONCE OR TWICE THE PROFESSOR GAVE ME A WARNING GESTURE BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DEFINITE GOAL AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF EXCITEMENT AS I FOLLOWED HIM FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT EXPLORING EVERY LITTLE RAVINE HE COULD DISCOVER
7190-90542-0046_83-9960-0048 AH THIS LOOKS PROMISING QUARLES SAID SUDDENLY IN A CORNER OF THE WALL OR TO BE MORE PRECISE FILLING UP A RENT IN IT WAS A SHED ROUGHLY BUILT BUT WITH A DOOR SECURED BY A VERY BUSINESS LIKE LOCK I THINK THE SHED IS CLIMBABLE
7190-90542-0048_5688-41232-0073 WE'LL GO CAREFULLY SAID QUARLES THERE MAY BE WORSE THAN POACHERS TRAPS HERE WITHOUT HELP FROM ME HE DROPPED FROM THE ROOF AND I FOLLOWED HIM THE NATURAL PASSAGE WAS WINDING AND ABOUT FIFTY YARDS LONG AND OPENED INTO ANOTHER PIT OF SOME SIZE
7190-90542-0050_103-1241-0021 THE BACK PART BEING CLOSED IN THE ROOF WAS THATCHED WITH BARK AND DRIED BRACKEN AND AGAINST ONE END OF THE VERANDA WAS A NOTCHED TREE TRUNK SERVING AS A LADDER AS I EXPECTED SAID QUARLES WITH SOME EXCITEMENT WE MUST GET ONTO THE VERANDA FOR A MOMENT
7190-90542-0051_6848-252322-0019 I THINK WE ARE ALONE HERE BUT KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN THE SHED WAS EVIDENTLY USED SOMETIMES THERE WAS A STONE SLAB WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FIREPLACE AND FROM A BEAM ABOVE HUNG A SHORT CHAIN ON WHICH A POT COULD EASILY BE FIXED WE'LL GET AWAY QUICKLY SAID QUARLES
7190-90542-0052_8419-286676-0008 WHEN IN ABOUT THIRTY HOURS TIME THE PROFESSOR'S SENSE OF DIRECTION WAS MARVELOUS
7190-90542-0053_4195-186236-0011 I DARESAY ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE OVER THE HOUSE
7190-90542-0056_4340-15220-0091 I THINK WE ARE FIRST BUT GREAT CARE IS NECESSARY HE WHISPERED WE CREPT FORWARD AND CONCEALED OURSELVES AMONG THE SCRUB VEGETATION WHICH GREW IN THAT PART OF THE PIT WHICH WAS OPEN TO THE SKY IT WAS DARK THE LONG SHED BARELY DISCERNIBLE
7190-90542-0061_3214-167607-0003 HE WAS SHORT THICK SET AND QUICK IN HIS MOVEMENTS
7190-90542-0066_198-209-0020 AND THE MAN WHO IS HE ON THE BENCH YESTERDAY SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM
7190-90542-0067_6078-54013-0060 FOR AN HOUR TWO THREE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT HORRIBLE BUNDLE SWUNG OVER THE FIRE AND THE MAN SAT ON HIS BLOCK OF WOOD STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7190-90542-0070_2764-36619-0004 MY DEAR WIGAN HE SAID WHEN AT LAST HE CONDESCENDED TO TALK IT WAS ZENA WHO FIRST SET ME ON THE RIGHT ROAD WHEN SHE REMARKED THAT A MAN WHO HAD WALKED IN A DITCH CARRYING A BAG WOULD ARREST ATTENTION TWO POINTS WERE SUGGESTED FIRST
7190-90542-0071_3807-4955-0010 THAT THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO GO TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY SECONDLY THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED TO TAKE A HEAD AWAY WITH HIM A MERE SPECULATION YOU MAY SAY
7190-90542-0073_196-122152-0021 I SOUGHT FOR SOME PECULIARITY IN HIS MANNER AND FOUND NONE YET HIS HISTORY COINCIDED WITH MY THEORY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM I SUPPOSE NOTHING RATHER AN INTERESTING CAREER BUT WITH AN HEREDITARY TAINT IN IT QUARLES WENT ON
7190-90542-0074_19-227-0038 HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
7190-90542-0075_1737-148989-0032 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT ALL THIS HE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OF HIS DOINGS CHRONICLED AND HE WROTE SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMEN'S NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS NORMANDY TOUR NATURE STUDIES AND SUCH LIKE ANOTHER POINT BOTH THESE MURDERS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
7190-90542-0078_6454-93938-0007 TO PRESERVE HIS SECRET I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTH THAT IS WHY I WARNED YOU TO BE READY TO SHOOT WHEN WE WENT UPON OUR JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY NOW THIS YEAR HE WAS IN ENGLAND ILLNESS HAD KEPT HIM TO HIS HOUSE YONDER
7190-90542-0083_8095-274346-0003 THE ARREST OF SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM CAUSED AN ENORMOUS SENSATION HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE HE DIED NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD FORTUNATELY HE HAD NO CHILDREN TO RUN THE RISK OF MADNESS IN THEIR TURN
7190-90543-0009_4481-17499-0043 THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION BUT IT DID NOT SATISFY ME I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HAD HE ANY DOCUMENT WHICH FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HE SAID HE HAD NOT
7190-90543-0012_6078-54013-0057 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
7190-90543-0014_2391-145015-0064 AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE CARELESSLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT WHAT THE THIEVES WERE IN SEARCH OF AND SURELY HAD THEY LEFT IN A HURRY THE BAG OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
7190-90543-0016_2514-149482-0092 HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN FROM SIR JOSEPH'S BOX WHICH CONTAINED ONLY TURKISH ONES AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD APPARENTLY BEEN THROWN DOWN CARELESSLY THERE WAS NO ASH UPON THE CARPET NOR ANYWHERE ELSE
7190-90543-0021_4898-28461-0014 NARROWS IT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH THE OTHER FACTS OF THE CASE EXACTLY I ANSWERED THERE IS A SUGGESTION TO MY MIND OF AMATEURISHNESS IN THE AFFAIR I GRANT THE SAFE WAS NOT A DIFFICULT ONE TO BREAK OPEN BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE IN A VERY EXPERT MANNER
7190-90543-0022_4830-25904-0010 THE CIGARETTE ENDS THE DIRTY GLASSES AND THE BISCUIT CRUMBS SEEM TO ME RATHER GRATUITOUS DECEPTIONS AND WAIT SAID QUARLES YOU ASSUME A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE DECEIVED NINE MEN OUT OF TEN YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE TENTH MAN
7190-90543-0023_6000-55211-0040 AMATEUR OR NOT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMART MAN SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ENEMY WIGAN ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR TO WHAT DEFINITE POINT DOES IT LEAD YOU TO THIS QUESTION I REPLIED DID SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD BURGLE HIS OWN HOUSE
7190-90543-0024_587-41611-0022 WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HIS MANNER WAS CURIOUS THEN THERE IS ONLY HIS OWN STATEMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT SUPPOSING HE WISHED TO GET RID OF PAPERS OR
7190-90543-0026_481-123720-0023 I THINK THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT PROFESSOR
7190-90543-0028_8063-274112-0003 WHEN I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HIS MANNER SEEMED CURIOUS AS I HAVE SAID HE AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO PART IN ANY GOVERNMENT SECRET OR MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY GRATUITOUS INFORMATION YOU UNDERSTAND
7190-90543-0037_8063-274115-0006 RATHER THAN INTENDED ROBBERY NOTHING HAD BEEN STOLEN BUT EVERYTHING IN HIS ROOM WAS IN DISORDER AND A SMALL AND UNIQUE INLAID CABINET WITH A SECRET SPRING LOCK HAD BEEN SMASHED TO PIECES SEVERAL CIGARETTE ENDS WERE ON THE FLOOR
7190-90543-0039_3486-166424-0033 ONLY SERVANTS BEING IN THE HOUSE THE COOK SUFFERING FROM FACEACHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS ALL NIGHT BUT HAD HEARD NOTHING
7190-90543-0041_6529-62554-0009 THE UNEXPECTED HAS HAPPENED I SAID NO NO THE EXPECTED
7226-86964-0000_229-130880-0004 WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN

7226-86964-0007_3214-167606-0036 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0009_7059-88364-0000 THAT GAVE US AN IMPETUS WHICH SOON CARRIED OUR VESSEL OUT OF SIGHT OF LYNDON AND ITS PAPER MILL AND STRAW STACKS PROPHETSTOWN FIVE MILES BELOW IS PRETTILY SITUATED IN AN OAK GROVE ON THE SOUTHERN BANK
7226-86964-0012_233-134440-0031 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0013_200-124139-0004 AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE WIZARD HE BADE THE UNITED STATES SOLDIERY DEFIANCE THERE ARE RAPIDS ALMOST CONTINUALLY FROM A MILE ABOVE PROPHETSTOWN TO ERIE TEN MILES BELOW THE RIVER BED HERE HAS A SHARPER DESCENT THAN CUSTOMARY
7226-86964-0016_2518-154825-0027 A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
7226-86964-0017_8088-284756-0039 HERE THE HIGH BANKS HAD RECEDED WITH SEVERAL MILES OF HEAVILY WOODED BOGGY BOTTOMS INTERVENING FLOODS HAD HELD HIGH CARNIVAL AND THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS WILD AND DESERTED THE CUT OFF WAS AN UGLY LOOKING CHANNEL
7226-86964-0024_6064-56165-0009 A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A MAN SHOUTING TO US AND BECKONING US OVER IT WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY MUDDY UNDER THE TREES WHICH HAD NOT LONG SUFFICED AS AN UMBRELLA AND THE RUBBER COATS WERE NOT WARRANTED TO WITHSTAND A DELUGE
7226-86964-0025_1455-134435-0044 SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
7226-86964-0027_6415-111615-0017 AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
7226-86964-0028_3664-11714-0019 WHICH HAD RECENTLY BECOME ENRICHED BY THE ADDITION OF AN INFANT SON THE PHENOMENAL POWERS OF OBSERVATION DISPLAYED BY THIS FIRST BORN YOUTH WERE REPORTED WITH MUCH DETAIL BY THE FOND FATHER WHO SAT CROUCHED UPON A BOAT SAIL IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE TENT
7226-86964-0031_3607-29116-0015 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86964-0032_7859-102518-0024 AND THERE WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE A STANDING FAMILY QUARREL THE FISHERMAN HAVING APPEALED TO MY JUDGMENT I ENDEAVORED WITH MILD CAUTION TO ARGUE HIM OUT OF HIS POSITION ON THE SCORE OF CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WIFE AND LITTLE ONE
7226-86964-0033_4397-15666-0017 AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
7226-86964-0034_6272-70168-0029 IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GUARANTIED A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AT THEIR STANDS NO OTHER LINE BEING ALLOWED WITHIN ONE MILE OF AN EXISTING FERRY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF THE STORM HAD APPARENTLY PASSED OVER AND WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY
7226-86964-0035_6563-285357-0035 BUT AFTER SUPPER ANOTHER SHOWER AND A STIFF HEAD WIND CAME UP AND WE WERE WELL BEDRAGGLED BY THE TIME A FERRY LANDING NEAR THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF ERIE WAS REACHED THE BOTTOMS ARE HERE A MILE OR TWO IN WIDTH WITH OCCASIONAL OPENINGS IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0036_6437-66173-0048 WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
7226-86964-0038_6367-65536-0037 IT'S SURE WE CAN'T TAKE YE I'D LIKE TO OTHERWISE BUT ERIE'S ONLY A MILE AWAY WE ASSURED HIM THAT WITH THESE MUDDY SWAMP ROADS AND IN OUR WET CONDITION NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WOULD INDUCE US TO TAKE A MILE'S TRAMP THE PARLEY
7226-86964-0042_5163-39921-0052 WE WALKED UP TO THE OPEN FRONT DOOR AND APPLIED FOR SHELTER YES MA'AM WE SOMETIMES KEEPS TAVERN MA'AM REPLIED A LARGE GREASY LOOKING BLACK HAIRED WOMAN OF SOME FORTY YEARS
7226-86964-0044_83-9960-0046 AND CHEAP DECORATIONS PECULIAR IN THE COUNTRY TO ALL THREE CLASSES OF ROOMS THE EVIDENCES OF POVERTY SHIFTLESSNESS AND UNTASTEFUL PRETENTIOUSNESS UPON EVERY SIDE
7226-86964-0045_1334-135589-0074 A HUGE WHEEZY OLD CABINET ORGAN WAS SET DIAGONALLY IN ONE CORNER AND UPON THIS AS WE ENTERED A YOUNG WOMAN WAS POUNDING AND PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR WHILE GIVING US SIDELONG GLANCES OF CURIOSITY
7226-86964-0047_1737-142396-0014 A YELLOW FIELD THICKLY PLANTED TO PURPLE PINEAPPLES A JAUNTY FORWARD CREATURE IN PIMPLES AND CURLS SHE RATTLED AWAY THROUGH A MOODY AND SANKEY HYMN BOOK THE WHEEZES AND GROANS OF THE ANTIQUE INSTRUMENT
7226-86964-0051_4853-27671-0024 W MODESTLY CONFESSED TO NEVER HAVING POSSESSED SUCH AN INSTRUMENT DOWN IN THESE PARTS REJOINED THE YOUNG WOMAN AS SHE WORKED THE BELLERS INTO A STRAIN OR TWO OF HOLD THE FORT APPARENTLY TO SHOW HOW EASY IT CAME TO TRAINED FEET
7226-86964-0053_1553-140047-0025 THE BED CHAMBER INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS A MARVEL IT OPENED OFF THE MAIN ROOM AND WAS DOUBTLESS ORIGINALLY A CUPBOARD SEVEN FEET SQUARE WITH A BROAD ROPED BEDSTEAD OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE LENGTH
7226-86964-0054_4137-11701-0030 NECESSITATING THE USE OF THE BED AS A DRESSING PLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF A SLEEPING CAR BUNK THIS CUBBY HOLE OF A ROOM WAS ALSO THE WARDROBE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE WALLS ABOVE THE BED BEING HUNG NEARLY TWO FEET DEEP
7226-86964-0056_8238-274553-0062 FOR IT WAS AS DARK AS EGYPT WITHIN EXCEPT FOR A FEW FAINT RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH CAME STRAGGLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE BOARD PARTITION SEPARATING US FROM THE SITTING ROOM CANDLE WE HAD NO SOONER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF OUR LITTLE BOX
7226-86964-0057_211-122425-0027 THAN THE CREAKY OLD CLEAT DOOR WAS GENTLY CLOSED UPON US AND BUTTONED BY OUR HOSTESS UPON THE OUTSIDE AS THE ONLY MEANS OF KEEPING IT SHUT AND WE WERE LEFT FREE TO GROPE ABOUT AMONG THESE MYSTERIES AS BEST WE MIGHT
7226-86965-0002_4014-186179-0040 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003_8609-262281-0031 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0004_5456-62043-0023 AND BEING SOMEWHAT DEAF WOULD BREAK IN UPON THE CONVERSATION WITH REMARKS SHARPER THAN THEY WERE PAT WITH OUR HOST A GLIB AND RAPID TALKER IN A SWAGGERING TONE ONE COULD NOT BUT BE MUCH AMUSED
7226-86965-0006_1455-134435-0013 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS

7226-86965-0014_7511-102419-0039 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0016_5463-39174-0049 WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
7226-86965-0018_6367-65536-0033 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0020_4018-107338-0022 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021_1926-147987-0013 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0022_3242-8112-0028 SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
7226-86965-0028_1743-142913-0013 IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
7226-86965-0033_5393-19219-0053 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0041_1034-121119-0062 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0044_7078-271888-0020 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045_7780-274562-0071 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0046_3436-172171-0032 I WENT UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO ENGAGE A TEAM TO TAKE OUR BOAT UPON ITS LAST PORTAGE AFTER HAVING BEEN GRUFFLY REFUSED BY A CHURLISH FARMER WHO DOUBTLESS RECOGNIZED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANOEIST AND A TRAMP
7226-86965-0049_7113-86041-0057 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
7264-92310-0001_1040-133433-0048 THE CAPITALIST OWNING THE SHEET WOULD NECESSARILY CONSIDER HIS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HE WAS INDEED COMPELLED TO DO SO UNLESS HE HAD ENORMOUS REVENUES FROM OTHER SOURCES AND RAN HIS PAPER AS A LUXURY COSTING A VAST FORTUNE A YEAR
7264-92310-0005_8238-283452-0039 BUT HE CERTAINLY COULD NOT PRINT AN ARTICLE AGAINST THEM NOR EVEN AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING HOW THEY WERE MADE WITHOUT LOSING A GREAT PART OF HIS INCOME DIRECTLY AND PERHAPS INDIRECTLY THE WHOLE OF IT FROM THE ANNOYANCE CAUSED TO OTHER ADVERTISERS WHO WOULD NOTE HIS INDEPENDENCE
7264-92310-0008_60-121082-0044 HAVING BECOME THE STAND BY OF THE NEWSPAPER THE LARGE ADVERTISER
7264-92310-0011_2289-152253-0018 BESIDES THOSE OF MERE AVARICE AFFECT EXCHANGE THERE ARE A MILLION HALF CONSCIOUS AND SUB CONSCIOUS MOTIVES AT WORK AS WELL THE LARGE ADVERTISER STILL MAINLY PAID FOR ADVERTISEMENT ACCORDING TO CIRCULATION
7264-92310-0014_405-130895-0012 OR SOME SUCH PLACE THAT THE PAPER WAS IN BAD TASTE NOT ONLY WAS THERE THIS NEGATIVE POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE ADVERTISER THAT OF REFUSING THE FAVOUR OR PATRONAGE OF HIS ADVERTISEMENTS THERE WAS ALSO A POSITIVE ONE THOUGH THAT ONLY GREW UP LATER
7264-92310-0016_7148-82991-0004 WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THIS ELEMENT FOR ONE THING THE POWER REPRESENTED BY THE GREAT CAPITALIST PRESS WAS A POWER EQUAL WITH THAT OF THE GREAT ADVERTISERS FOR ANOTHER THERE WAS NO CLEAR CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CAPITALISM THAT OWNED NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITALISM THAT ADVERTISED
7264-92310-0021_6209-34599-0026 OFTEN QUITE CONSCIOUS AND DIRECT OF ADVERTISING POWER OVER THE PRESS AND THIS WAS AS I HAVE SAID NOT ONLY NEGATIVE THAT WAS LONG OBVIOUS BUT AT LAST POSITIVE
7264-92310-0023_1263-141777-0027 SO FAR WE SEE THE GROWTH OF THE PRESS MARKED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ONE IT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A VERY FEW RICH MEN AND NEARLY ALWAYS OF MEN OF BASE ORIGIN AND CAPACITIES TWO IT IS IN THEIR HANDS A MERE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
7264-92310-0024_5652-39938-0039 THREE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISERS WHO CAN IN PART CONTROL IT BUT THESE ARE OF THE SAME CAPITALIST KIND IN MOTIVE AND MANNER WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PAPERS THEIR POWER DOES NOT THEREFORE CLASH IN THE MAIN WITH THAT OF THE OWNERS
7264-92310-0027_5808-54425-0021 THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
7264-92310-0028_4362-15663-0088 IT IS THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNER AS THE TRUE GOVERNING POWER IN THE POLITICAL MACHINERY OF THE STATE SUPERIOR TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE STATE NOMINATING MINISTERS AND DISMISSING THEM IMPOSING POLICIES AND IN GENERAL USURPING SOVEREIGNTY
7264-92310-0030_1263-141777-0025 IT WAS UNDREAMT OF BUT A FEW YEARS AGO IT IS ALREADY TO DAY THE CAPITAL FACT OF OUR WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM A PRIME MINISTER IS MADE OR DEPOSED BY THE OWNER OF A GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS NOT BY POPULAR VOTE OR BY ANY OTHER FORM OF OPEN AUTHORITY
7264-92310-0032_248-130644-0006 MAINLY GOVERNED TO DAY NOT EVEN BY THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS NOR EVEN BY THOSE WHO PAY THEM MONEY BUT BY WHATEVER OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER TRUST IS FOR THE MOMENT THE MOST UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE MOST AMBITIOUS
7264-92314-0000_1447-130551-0009 I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
7264-92314-0004_1970-28415-0008 AND THAT FALSEHOOD IS SO CLEARLY DICTATED BY THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXECUTIVE POWER THAT THEY MERIT THE TITLE OFFICIAL THE REGIME UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING IS THAT OF A PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC TRADITION OF ENGLAND
7264-92314-0005_89-218-0029 THIS PLUTOCRACY A FEW WEALTHY INTERESTS IN PART CONTROLS IN PART IS EXPRESSED BY IS IN PART IDENTICAL WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND IT HAS IN THE EXISTING CAPITALIST PRESS AN ALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92314-0011_5750-100289-0016 NEVER DEALS WITH MATTERS VITAL TO ITS PRESTIGE ON THE CONTRARY IT DELIBERATELY SIDE TRACKS ANY VITAL DISCUSSION THAT SINCERE CONVICTION MAY HAVE FORCED UPON THE PUBLIC AND SPOILS THE SCENT WITH FALSE ISSUES
7264-92314-0012_1040-133433-0051 ONE PAPER NOT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WAS CLAMOURING AGAINST THE EXCESS OF LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT ITS REMEDY WAS AN OPPOSITION TO BE HEADED BY A LAWYER ANOTHER WAS VERY SERIOUS UPON SECRET TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
7264-92314-0013_7178-34644-0007 IT SUPPRESSED FOR MONTHS ALL REFERENCE TO THE ASTOUNDING INSTANCE OF THAT MISDEMEANOUR BY THE CONNECTIONS OF A VERY PROMINENT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN EARLY IN THE WAR AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE SINGLE REFERENCE MADE TO THIS CRIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7264-92314-0022_229-130880-0028 THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92314-0023_32-4137-0030 EVEN WHEN GAMBLING ADVENTURERS OF THIS SORT ARE KNOWN AND RESPONSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL POLITICS THEIR POWER IS A GRAVE DANGER POSSESSING AS THE NEWSPAPER OWNERS DO EVERY POWER OF CONCEALMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
7264-92314-0024_1723-141149-0025 NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
7264-92314-0026_2002-139469-0068 SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHAT I HAVE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IN OUR TOP HEAVY PLUTOCRACY THERE HAS ARISEN A CERTAIN FORCE FOR WHICH I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A NAME BUT WHICH I WILL CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME THE FREE PRESS I MIGHT CALL IT THE INDEPENDENT PRESS
7264-92314-0027_1447-130551-0030 WERE IT NOT THAT SUCH A WORD WOULD CONNOTE AS YET A LITTLE TOO MUCH POWER THOUGH I DO BELIEVE ITS POWER TO BE RISING AND THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE CHANGE OUR AFFAIRS
7264-92314-0028_441-128982-0025 I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUT I READ THIS FREE PRESS FRENCH AND ENGLISH COLONIAL AND AMERICAN REGULARLY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
7264-92314-0029_1502-122615-0027 IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND AND FOR ALL I KNOW ELSEWHERE THERE HAS ARISEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPLETE CORRUPTION AND FALSEHOOD OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CROP OF NEW ORGANS WHICH ARE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD ORGANS OF OPINION
7264-92314-0030_32-21634-0018 THE NEW AGE WAS I THINK THE PIONEER IN THE MATTER
7264-92314-0031_201-127786-0000 SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
7264-92316-0001_2514-149482-0055 MEN FOUND THAT THE GREAT PAPERS IN THEIR FINAL PHASE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGION THEY DARED DO NOTHING BUT REPEAT VERY DISCREETLY THE VAGUEST ETHICAL PLATITUDES THEY HARDLY DARED DO EVEN THAT THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED A SORT OF INVERTEBRATE COMMON OPINION
7264-92316-0004_78-369-0041 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH A LARGE DAILY PAPER OWNED BY A JEW FROM ONE OWNED BY AN AGNOSTIC OR A CATHOLIC NECESSITY OF EXPRESSION COMPELLED THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONE MOTIVE OF RELIGION MEN CAME ACROSS VERY LITTLE OF THIS IN ENGLAND
7264-92316-0005_4137-11701-0018 BECAUSE ENGLAND WAS FOR LONG VIRTUALLY HOMOGENEOUS IN RELIGION AND THAT RELIGION WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE FREE PRESS AROSE BUT SUCH A FREE PRESS IN DEFENCE OF RELIGION THE PIONEER OF ALL THE FREE PRESS AROSE IN IRELAND AND IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE
7264-92316-0006_7800-283493-0010 BUT IT ASSERTED THE NECESSITY OF SPECIALLY EMPHASIZING ITS PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW IN ITS OWN COLUMNS FOR RELIGION AFFECTS ALL LIFE
7264-92316-0007_909-131041-0029 A GENERATION AGO AND MORE GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN WERE PERSUADED THAT A SOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE WAS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT THEY CALLED NATIONALIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE
7264-92316-0008_5463-39173-0025 THAT IS OF COURSE IN PLAIN ENGLISH PUTTING LAND HOUSES AND MACHINERY AND STORES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLITICIANS FOR CONTROL IN USE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CONSUMPTION
7264-92316-0009_150-126112-0030 THIS CREED WAS HELD WITH PASSIONATE CONVICTION BY MEN OF THE HIGHEST ABILITY IN EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE AND A SOCIALIST PRESS BEGAN TO ARISE WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE FREE AND SOON IN ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92316-0010_2952-408-0005 AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
7264-92316-0011_6209-34600-0028 RELIGION THEN AND COGNATE ENTHUSIASMS WERE THE FIRST BREEDERS OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS STAMPED THE WHOLE MOVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CHARACTER TO WHICH I SHALL LATER REFER WHEN I COME TO ITS DISABILITIES
7264-92316-0018_587-41611-0025 BUT I NOW KNOW THAT THESE SMALL SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS WERE TALKING THE PLAINEST COMMON SENSE WHEN THEY SPECIFICALLY EMPHASIZED AS CAPITALIST THE FALSEHOODS AND SUPPRESSIONS OF THEIR GREAT CONTEMPORARIES
7264-92316-0027_2391-145015-0038 IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE
7264-92316-0028_125-121124-0016 NO ONE OF THEM IS IN ANY SENSE GENERAL OR REALLY NATIONAL THE FREE PRESS GIVES YOU THE TRUTH BUT ONLY IN DISJOINTED SECTIONS FOR IT IS DISPARATE AND IT IS PARTICULARIST IT IS MARKED WITH ISOLATION AND IT IS SO MARKED BECAUSE ITS ORIGIN LAY IN VARIOUS AND MOST DIVERSE PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0030_3112-9555-0011 MEN GRADUALLY CAME TO NOTICE THAT ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER OF GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST SOMETIMES OF VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST WAS DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED IN THE PRINCIPAL GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS AND THAT POSITIVE FALSEHOODS WERE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTED OR STATED
7264-92316-0031_3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7264-92316-0032_150-132655-0034 BUT IT WAS A SORT OF DUAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH YET MODIFIED THE POWER OF THE VULGAR OWNER I MYSELF REMEMBER THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN AND DINED OUT THE PROPRIETOR WHO WAS A LORD AND NERVOUS WHEN HE MET A GENTLEMAN
7264-92316-0033_211-122425-0022 THE EDITOR BECAME AND NOW IS A MERE MOUTHPIECE OF THE PROPRIETOR EDITORS SUCCEED EACH OTHER RAPIDLY OF GREAT PAPERS TO DAY THE EDITOR'S NAME OF THE MOMENT IS HARDLY KNOWN
7264-92316-0034_6415-116629-0011 BUT NOT A CABINET MINISTER THAT COULD NOT PASS AN EXAMINATION IN THE LIFE VICES VULNERABILITY FORTUNE INVESTMENTS AND FAVOURS OF THE OWNER THE CHANGE WAS RAPIDLY ADMITTED IT CAME QUICKLY BUT THOROUGHLY AT LAST LIKE MOST RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IT EXCEEDED ITSELF
7264-92316-0035_6531-61334-0088 MEN OWNING THE CHIEF NEWSPAPERS COULD BE HEARD BOASTING OF THEIR POWER IN PUBLIC AS AN ADMITTED THING AND AS THIS POWER WAS RECOGNIZED AND AS IT GREW WITH TIME AND EXPERIMENT IT BRED A REACTION

7278-246956-0010_4859-26870-0021 THAT HE WAS COMFORTING THE SISTER INDIVIDUALLY IN HOLDING OUT TO HER BROTHER THE MIGHTY HOPE OF A RESTORED PURITY AND WHEN ONCE MORE HIS MIND COULD RECEIVE THE MESSAGES

7278-91083-0041_7264-92310-0020 FEBRUARY THIRD EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR FROM THE EFFECTS OF A STROKE OF PARALYSIS SUSTAINED AT THE LEDGER OFFICE ON JANUARY EIGHTEENTH
730-358-0002_298-126791-0040 THE LIGHT POURED IN UPON ME AGAIN I WALKED AND I BELIEVE DESCENDED BUT I PRESENTLY FOUND A GREAT ALTERATION IN MY SENSATIONS BEFORE DARK AND OPAQUE BODIES HAD SURROUNDED ME
730-358-0004_26-495-0073 THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
730-358-0008_374-180298-0045 I KNEW AND COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT FEELING PAIN INVADE ME ON ALL SIDES I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SOON A GENTLE LIGHT STOLE OVER THE HEAVENS AND GAVE ME A SENSATION OF PLEASURE
730-358-0009_39-121914-0042 THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER IT MOVED SLOWLY BUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK
730-358-0011_3723-171115-0040 THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
730-358-0015_6385-220959-0025 SOMETIMES I TRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THE UNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTO SILENCE AGAIN
730-358-0016_3214-167602-0023 THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
730-358-0017_1723-141149-0008 MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT AND TO PERCEIVE OBJECTS IN THEIR RIGHT FORMS I DISTINGUISHED THE INSECT FROM THE HERB AND BY DEGREES ONE HERB FROM ANOTHER
730-358-0018_5808-54425-0010 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
730-358-0019_1455-138263-0010 IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVE EMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS I EXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE
730-358-0021_3242-67168-0029 AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
730-358-0024_1926-147979-0008 AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
730-358-0027_831-130739-0045 AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPRODUCE IT I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY
730-358-0031_7447-91186-0010 HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME
730-358-0032_226-131533-0012 AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
730-358-0035_1081-125237-0022 I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
730-358-0036_7113-86041-0056 ALLURED MY APPETITE ONE OF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHIN THE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME
730-358-0044_2136-5140-0006 BY A LOAF OF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP
730-358-0046_89-218-0017 THE RAIN DROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLE WATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELD A YOUNG CREATURE
730-358-0048_2007-149877-0014 HER FAIR HAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD
730-358-0050_5322-7680-0004 PRESENTLY I SAW THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN WITH SOME TOOLS IN HIS HAND CROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE COTTAGE
730-358-0052_4160-11550-0012 WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT AN OLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY
730-358-0053_5022-29411-0052 WHO TAKING UP AN INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO PLAY AND TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SWEETER THAN THE VOICE OF THE THRUSH OR THE NIGHTINGALE IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT
730-358-0055_3723-171631-0025 HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE
730-358-0056_6415-116629-0000 AND I WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW UNABLE TO BEAR THESE EMOTIONS
730-358-0057_26-496-0021 BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS A LOAD OF WOOD THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ON THE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGE
730-358-0061_7517-100442-0007 THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
730-358-0063_201-127786-0007 DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE PLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS
730-358-0064_1926-143879-0045 THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAY BUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THE HARMONY OF THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS
730-359-0000_3857-180923-0000 I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
730-359-0002_7635-105409-0023 THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
730-359-0003_481-123720-0075 EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
730-359-0005_1743-142912-0028 THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
730-359-0007_7148-82991-0021 THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
730-359-0010_403-216-0019 WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
730-359-0012_1578-6379-0001 I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
730-359-0017_625-132112-0042 I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
730-359-0021_150-126107-0030 BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
730-359-0022_7517-100442-0010 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0027_831-130746-0038 AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
730-359-0028_78-368-0034 BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
730-359-0031_6476-57446-0012 FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
730-359-0032_2691-156755-0018 WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
730-359-0037_8770-295462-0027 WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
730-359-0039_163-122947-0053 FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
730-359-0045_125-121342-0034 THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
730-359-0049_1624-168623-0051 HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
730-360-0000_1455-134435-0024 I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY I SHALL RELATE EVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
730-360-0003_7800-283493-0012 THAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WAS MELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHER PAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED
730-360-0005_8098-278252-0028 THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
730-360-0006_831-130739-0024 ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
730-360-0008_1841-179183-0000 EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
730-360-0010_89-218-0001 SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
730-360-0013_4898-28461-0065 AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
730-360-0014_8630-305212-0044 PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
730-360-0021_2182-150130-0030 IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOST OF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS
730-360-0022_5703-47212-0044 IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
730-360-0023_2436-2481-0031 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
730-360-0027_458-126294-0002 HE HAD CHOSEN THIS WORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THE EASTERN AUTHORS
730-360-0030_4137-11702-0006 INHABITANTS THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS WAS MAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SO VICIOUS AND BASE
730-360-0031_4051-11218-0061 AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
730-360-0034_89-218-0052 I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
730-360-0035_1502-122619-0075 UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
730-360-0036_6272-70171-0030 AND WHAT WAS I OF MY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT I POSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY
730-360-0043_8629-261139-0021 ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
7302-86814-0001_6081-41998-0041 THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION
7302-86814-0002_3879-174923-0004 PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE THE COURT YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS ENCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY
7302-86814-0003_7780-274562-0058 WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PALE CAREWORN AND HAGGARD LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS
7302-86814-0006_226-131532-0010 IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE
7302-86814-0011_307-127535-0013 HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG BUG SAID ANOTHER DRESSES IN FINE STYLE AND THEN TO BE HERE SO YOUNG OH WHAT LARKS MEANWHILE THE OBJECT OF THIS HIDEOUS ADMIRATION APPROACHED THE WICKET
7302-86814-0015_1594-135914-0117 THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY
7302-86814-0018_7367-86737-0118 ROLLED HIS TONGUE AROUND HIS CHEEKS AND SMACKED HIS LIPS IN A MANNER EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED WORDS AMONG THE BANDITS WHEN FORCED TO BE SILENT IT WAS A MASONIC SIGN CADEROUSSE HAD TAUGHT HIM
7302-86814-0019_909-131045-0014 HE WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THEM THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS THROWN DOWN AND THE IRON HEELED SHOE REPLACED ON THE FOOT OF THE WRETCH TO WHOM IT BELONGED SOME VOICES WERE HEARD TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS RIGHT
7302-86814-0020_27-123349-0046 THAT HE INTENDED TO BE CIVIL IN HIS WAY AND THAT THEY WOULD SET THE EXAMPLE OF LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE AND THE MOB RETIRED THE KEEPER WAS SO STUPEFIED AT THIS SCENE THAT HE TOOK ANDREA BY THE HANDS
7302-86814-0023_7367-86737-0023 GOLD SHOWERED DOWN UPON ME AND THE MOST SPLENDID ALLIANCES ABOUT TO BE ENTERED INTO AN UNHAPPY LAPSE OF FORTUNE AND THE ABSENCE OF MY PROTECTOR HAVE CAST ME DOWN CERTAINLY BUT NOT FOREVER
7302-86814-0024_7278-91083-0009 THE HAND WHICH HAS RETREATED FOR A WHILE WILL BE AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH TO SAVE ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I SHALL THINK MYSELF SINKING INTO THE ABYSS WHY SHOULD I RISK AN IMPRUDENT STEP IT MIGHT ALIENATE MY PROTECTOR
7302-86814-0025_2289-152254-0011 UPON THE IRON BARS THE BOLTED DOORS AND THE SHADOW WHICH MOVED BEHIND THE OTHER GRATING

7302-86815-0003_5808-48608-0029 THE PROOFS WERE CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCING SINCE THEY RESTED UPON A FEW WORDS WRITTEN BY AN ESCAPED GALLEY SLAVE ON HIS DEATH BED AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY HATRED OR REVENGE
7302-86815-0005_1246-135815-0000 WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ONLY VULNERABLE POINT LEFT IN HIS FROZEN HEART THE CASE WAS THEREFORE PREPARED OWING TO THE INCESSANT LABOR

7367-86737-0056_6367-65536-0040 IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
7367-86737-0059_5789-70653-0030 TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
7367-86737-0061_6181-216552-0083 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
7367-86737-0062_1553-140047-0029 AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
7367-86737-0064_1963-147036-0014 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
7367-86737-0065_1034-121119-0060 THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
7367-86737-0067_3486-166446-0021 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
7367-86737-0068_1069-133709-0024 ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
7367-86737-0069_3699-175950-0022 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
7367-86737-0071_3664-178366-0023 THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
7367-86737-0073_5703-47212-0040 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0074_163-122947-0080 DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
7367-86737-0075_27-124992-0042 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
7367-86737-0076_5049-25947-0096 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0079_3699-19401-0019 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0080_200-126784-0007 AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
7367-86737-0082_5750-100289-0084 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
7367-86737-0084_2952-407-0024 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
7367-86737-0085_2911-7601-0036 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
7367-86737-0087_6209-34599-0038 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
7367-86737-0092_4441-76262-0001 CONTINUED CUCUMETTO LAUGHING SOONER OR LATER YOUR TURN WILL COME CARLINI'S TEETH CLINCHED CONVULSIVELY NOW THEN SAID CUCUMETTO ADVANCING TOWARDS THE OTHER BANDITS ARE YOU COMING
7367-86737-0093_1447-17506-0014 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
7367-86737-0094_1098-133695-0081 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
7367-86737-0095_4051-11217-0039 AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
7367-86737-0096_4788-94904-0015 AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
7367-86737-0099_89-219-0052 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7367-86737-0101_1246-124548-0014 I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY CARLINI STAYED BEHIND ALL SAVAGE NATURES APPRECIATE A DESPERATE DEED NO OTHER OF THE BANDITS WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT CARLINI HAD DONE NOW THEN CRIED CARLINI
7367-86737-0104_7402-90848-0037 AT MIDNIGHT THE SENTINEL GAVE THE ALARM AND IN AN INSTANT ALL WERE ON THE ALERT IT WAS RITA'S FATHER WHO BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S RANSOM IN PERSON HERE SAID HE TO CUCUMETTO HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD
7367-86737-0106_250-142276-0012 THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
7367-86737-0108_7517-100437-0009 AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
7367-86737-0109_2289-152258-0036 THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
7367-86737-0111_2817-142371-0052 AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
7367-86737-0112_6880-216547-0089 RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN
7367-86737-0114_8324-286682-0022 THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
7367-86737-0115_2436-2476-0018 I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
7402-59171-0002_3168-173564-0042 HE HAS GONE ABOUT LIKE A PICKPOCKET OF ILLUSIONS FROM THE WORLD OF LITERATURE TO THE WORLD OF MORALS AND FROM THE WORLD OF MORALS TO THE WORLD OF POLITICS AND EVERYWHERE HE HAS GONE AN INNUMERABLE GROWL HAS FOLLOWED HIM
7402-59171-0003_2416-152139-0036 NOT THAT HE HAS NOT HAD HIS DISCIPLES MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WHAT MISTER SHAW SAYS ON ANY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE TIMES OR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN SAYS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED A CHURCH HOWEVER
7402-59171-0004_27-124992-0014 BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH AT HIS DISCIPLES AS UNFEELINGLY AS AT ANYBODY ELSE HE HAS COURTED UNPOPULARITY AS OTHER MEN HAVE COURTED POPULARITY HE HAS REFUSED TO ASSUME THE VACUOUS COUNTENANCE EITHER OF AN IDOL
7402-59171-0007_3259-158083-0120 WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN THE MERE BUSINESS OF INTERESTING US BEYOND ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME
7402-59171-0008_2416-152137-0024 PROBABLY HE WAS DOOMED TO BE A FIGURE JUST AS DOCTOR JOHNSON WAS IF HE HAD NOT TOLD US LEGENDS ABOUT HIMSELF
7402-59171-0010_7113-86041-0052 STOP ADVERTISING MYSELF ON THE CONTRARY I MUST DO IT MORE THAN EVER LOOK AT PEARS'S SOAP THERE IS A SOLID HOUSE IF YOU LIKE BUT EVERY WALL IS STILL PLASTERED WITH THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS IF I WERE TO GIVE UP ADVERTISING
7402-59171-0012_6415-111615-0002 HE IS IN THE LINE OF ALL THOSE TRAMPS AND STAGE IRISHMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH LIFE WITH SO FINE A SWAGGER OF WORDS THIS ONLY MEANS THAT IN HIS LIFE HE IS AN ARTIST
7402-59171-0015_3879-173592-0016 HE OBSERVES IN ONE OF THE MANY PASSAGES IN WHICH HE JUSTIFIES HIMSELF THE AUDIENCE THINKS IT IS BEING MADE FUN OF IN REALITY I AM SIMPLY A VERY CAREFUL WRITER OF NATURAL HISTORY
7402-59171-0016_3982-178459-0039 ONE IS BOUND TO CONTRADICT HIM MISTER SHAW OFTEN THINKS HE IS PRESENTING TRUE HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE IS MERELY PRESENTING HIS OPINIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF SOLDIERS OF ARTISTS OF WOMEN OR
7402-59171-0023_5463-39174-0037 THE PROPORTION OF UNREALITY IS NOT OVERWHELMING IT HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED AFTER ALL IF THE CHARACTER OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN IN THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA IS MACHINE MADE
7402-59171-0026_5463-39173-0005 DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
7402-59171-0028_1594-135914-0031 AND THE CHARACTERIZATION IN MOLIERE IN SHAW'S PLAYS THE CHARACTERS ARE LESS REPRESENTATIVE OF VICES OR PASSIONS THAN THOSE OF MOLIERE AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF CLASS PROFESSION OR SECT
7402-59171-0036_587-54108-0057 MOLIERE ANTICIPATED MISTER SHAW IN OUTRAGING THE SENTIMENT FOR INSTANCE WHICH HAS GATHERED ROUND THE FAMILY MOLIERE AND SHAW AS HE PUTS IT WITH QUAINT SERIOUSNESS APPEAR TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT A FATHER IS WHAT A FATHER IS WORTH
7402-59171-0040_7264-92316-0002 HE HAS DONE THIS SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE EXUBERANCE OF MIRTH SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF A SATIRIST EVEN HIS BITTERNESS IS NEVER VENOMOUS HOWEVER HE IS GENIAL BEYOND THE MAJORITY OF INVETERATE CONTROVERSIALISTS AND PROPAGANDISTS
7402-59171-0041_7059-88364-0002 HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO WOUND AND HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO MISUNDERSTAND BUT HE IS FREE FROM MALICE THE GENIALITY OF HIS COMEDY ON THE OTHER HAND IS OFTEN MORE OFFENSIVE THAN MALICE
7402-59171-0042_8465-246940-0016 BECAUSE IT IS FROM AN ORTHODOX POINT OF VIEW GENIALITY IN THE WRONG PLACE IT IS LIKE A GRIN IN CHURCH A LAUGH AT A MARRIAGE SERVICE
7402-59171-0043_5703-47212-0052 THAT HE WAS NOT INTENSELY SERIOUS IN ALL THAT HE WROTE ABOUT THE WAR BUT HIS SERIOUSNESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SERIOUSNESS OF IN THE HIGHER SENSE OF THE WORD THE COMIC ARTIST OF THE DISILLUSIONIST
7402-59171-0044_8580-287364-0008 HE SEES CURRENT HISTORY FROM THE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW SAY TO THE LYRIC POET
7402-59171-0048_3112-9555-0037 IT MAY BE SAID OF MISTER SHAW THAT IN HIS POLITICS AS IN HIS PLAYS HE HAS SOUGHT UTOPIA ALONG THE PATH OF DISILLUSION AS OTHER MEN HAVE SOUGHT IT ALONG THE PATH OF IDEALISM
7402-90848-0001_4859-29340-0038 AND SHE SMACKED THE POOR LAD SOUNDLY A DOZEN TIMES A DAY DID HIM NO GOOD WHATEVER NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT ONE MORNING PRINCESS ZENZA THE RULER OF THE LAND HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE COTTAGE AND HEARD BOBO BEING GIVEN A TERRIBLE TONGUE LASHING

7447-91186-0037_2989-138035-0021 STUDENTS MISS THE SOUL OF BACH BECAUSE OF THE SOULLESS MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY DEFACE HIS LEGACY TO THEM HIS TWELVE LITTLE PRELUDES ALONE CONTAIN THE MATERIALS FOR AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF MUSIC THE INVENTIONS
7447-91186-0038_198-209-0002 TOO OFTEN TREATED AS DRY AS DUST STUDIES ARE LADEN WITH BEAUTIFUL FIGURES AND DEVICES THAT FURNISH INSPIRATION FOR ALL TIME AS INDICATED BY THEIR TITLE WHICH SIGNIFIES A COMPOUND OF APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION
7447-91186-0039_6209-34600-0014 AND JUST DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE THE ELEMENTS OF MUSICAL TASTE AS WELL AS FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF THE FINGERS HIS WELL TEMPERED CLAVICHORD HAS BEEN CALLED THE PIANIST'S SACRED BOOK
7447-91186-0042_8324-286681-0021 EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
7447-91186-0043_1926-147979-0048 DEVELOPING INTO EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC PROGRESSIONS AND CADENCES IS A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE BACH FUGUE HIS SUITES EXALTED FOREVER THE FAMILIAR DANCE TUNES OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE HIS WONDERFUL CHROMATIC FANTASIA AND FUGUE
7447-91187-0001_328-129766-0010 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0004_60-121082-0016 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0009_6272-70191-0014 AGREEABLE TO HIM TO GRATIFY THE HAUNTING DEMANDS OF HIS LYRIC MUSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF IN PRIVACY TO THE EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE MYSTERIES OF HARMONY
7447-91187-0010_8238-274553-0007 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011_5463-39173-0026 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0014_2910-131096-0020 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0020_3879-174923-0045 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0023_78-368-0022 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0029_196-122152-0003 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0031_8770-295462-0030 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032_2416-152139-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0033_78-368-0023 NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
7447-91187-0035_7226-86965-0015 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0036_6181-216552-0071 THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
7447-91187-0037_4680-16026-0013 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0039_8630-305212-0019 AN ADMIRABLE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING HEAVINESS AND CLUMSINESS THEN LEGATO STACCATO THEN ACCENTED LEGATO THEN PURE LEGATO
7447-91187-0043_909-131044-0009 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044_8108-280359-0022 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0045_446-123502-0025 AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
7447-91187-0046_839-130898-0081 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0048_7059-77900-0009 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0051_5022-29411-0056 WHOEVER PLAYS CHOPIN WITH SLEDGE HAMMER FINGERS WILL DEADEN ALL SENSE OF HIS POETRY CHARM AND GRACE WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM WITH WEAK SENTIMENTALISM WILL MISS ALTOGETHER HIS DIGNITY AND STRENGTH
7447-91187-0053_8123-275209-0009 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
7447-91187-0055_1867-154075-0002 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0058_2910-131096-0049 REQUIRES HIGHLY MATURED ARTISTIC TASTE AND ABSOLUTE MUSICAL CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE TO ENJOY PLAYING BEFORE MISCELLANEOUS AUDIENCES WHOSE UNSYMPATHETIC CURIOSITY HE DECLARED PARALYZED HIM
7447-91187-0060_839-130898-0076 SPIRITUALIZING ITS TIMBRE LIBERATING IT FROM TRADITIONAL ORCHESTRAL AND CHORAL EFFECTS AND ELEVATING IT TO AN INDEPENDENT POWER IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC BESIDES ENRICHING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE PIANO HE AUGMENTED THE MATERIALS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION
7447-91187-0061_254-27760-0001 HARMONY AND RHYTHM NEW CHORD EXTENSIONS PASSAGES OF DOUBLE NOTES ARABESQUES AND HARMONIC COMBINATIONS WERE DEVISED BY HIM
7447-91187-0063_4680-16042-0002 BUT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE TESTS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY INGENIOUS DEVICE THAT GAVE CHARACTER TO HIS EXQUISITE CANTILENA AND SOFTENED HIS MOST STARTLING CHORD PROGRESSIONS
7447-91187-0065_7113-86041-0028 THE PRELUDES MOODS IN MINIATURE THE NOCTURNES NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES
7447-91187-0066_2007-132570-0057 FAERY DRAMAS THE POLONAISES HEROIC HYMNS OF BATTLE THE VALSES AND MAZURKAS
7447-91187-0067_6848-252323-0037 TO WRITE OF THE FOUR IMPROMPTUS IN THEIR OWN KEY OF UNRESTRAINED FEELING AND PONDERED INTENTION WOULD NOT BE AS EASY AS RECAPTURING THE FIRST CARELESS RAPTURE OF THE LARK UNQUESTIONABLY
7447-91187-0068_4214-7146-0001 THE POETRY OF CHOPIN IS OF THE MOST EXQUISITE LYRIC CHARACTER HIS LEADERSHIP IS SUPREME SO ORIGINAL WAS HIS CONCEPTION SO FINISHED HIS WORKMANSHIP SO SUBLIME HIS PURPOSE
7447-91187-0069_3526-176651-0002 THAT WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM WITH SCHUMANN HE IS THE BOLDEST PROUDEST POETIC SPIRIT OF THE TIME HIS GREATNESS IS HIS ARISTOCRACY SAYS OSCAR BIE HE STANDS AMONG MUSICIANS IN HIS FAULTLESS VESTURE
7505-258958-0003_5322-7679-0035 IN ITS POWER TO GRATIFY WANTS THE CLOSER THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT OF WANTS AND THAT OF GOODS THE GREATER WILL BE THE TOTAL OF GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0004_1183-128659-0009 OR BY SOCIETY DURING THE INCOME PERIOD THE TERM NATIONAL OR SOCIAL INCOME MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH INDIVIDUAL OR PRIVATE INCOME IN THE OBJECTIVE SENSE
7505-258958-0005_5322-7678-0013 ONLY WHEN GOODS ARE PRODUCED INDIVIDUALS MAY ACQUIRE INCOME BY GIFT BEQUEST THEFT OR OTHER MODES OF TRANSFER FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN MANY CASES THE TWO KINDS OF INCOME HOWEVER AGREE
7505-258958-0007_426-122821-0021 FOR MANY UTILITIES AND LABOR SERVICES THAT NEVER TAKE ON A MATERIAL OR MONEY EXPRESSION ARE INCLUDED IN EITHER CASE INDEED WE ARE CLOSE HERE TO THE CONCEPTION OF PSYCHIC INCOME
7505-258958-0008_196-122150-0014 MUST BE A NET ADDITION BUT THE TERM GROSS INCOME IS NOT WITHOUT POPULAR AND PRACTICAL MEANING GROSS INCOME IS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OF IN THE SENSE OF TOTAL RECEIPTS
7505-258958-0009_7517-100442-0028 AS THE TOTAL OF GOODS SECURED NET INCOME IS THE REMAINDER AFTER DEDUCTING EXPENDITURES AND AFTER REPLACING THE GOODS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE INCOME IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME GOODS TECHNICALLY
7505-258958-0012_200-124139-0030 THE GOODS THAT COME INTO A MAN'S POSSESSION IN ANY PERIOD ARE OF MANY SORTS TO GET SOME HE HAS DESTROYED MANY PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GOODS
7505-258958-0013_198-129977-0030 WHILE TO GET OTHERS HE HAS NOT NEEDED TO USE UP THE ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PAST OR TO MORTGAGE THE FUTURE THE ONE KIND IS GROSS THE OTHER NET INCOME
7505-258958-0014_6078-54007-0027 OF A SERIES OF GRATIFICATIONS IS A REGULAR SERIES OF CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT MANY THINGS EXISTING WHICH COULD BE USED TO SECURE A GRATIFICATION ARE NOT IN FACT TREATED AS CONSUMPTION GOODS
7505-258958-0015_1069-133699-0046 A CROP OF CORN IS NOT ALL INCOME IN A TIME OF FAMINE IT COULD BE USED BUT SEED CORN WAS SAVED FROM LAST YEAR
7505-258958-0021_8419-286667-0000 IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
7505-258958-0022_7302-86814-0033 THE REAL INCOME BUT CERTAINLY IT IS NOT INCOME IN THE MOST ESSENTIAL SENSE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MEN CANNOT BE FEELINGS THEY CAN ONLY CALL OUT OR OCCASION FEELING
7505-258958-0025_909-131045-0010 OR THAT MEN PERFORM FOR EACH OTHER E G THOSE OF THE SINGER PHYSICIAN TEACHER JUDGE ALL SERVICES THAT DO NOT TAKE ON MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0026_8797-294123-0052 THERE WAS A LONG STANDING DISPUTE IN ECONOMIC LITERATURE REGARDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOR PRODUCTIVE LABOR WAS SAID TO BE THAT WHICH EMBODIED ITSELF IN ABIDING MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0027_4788-94904-0027 THE DISTINCTION LED TO SOME PECULIAR PUZZLES AND PARADOXES THE BARTENDER MIXING DRINKS ADDS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IN A MINUTE THAT VALUE IS DISSIPATED
7505-258958-0028_1841-179183-0036 ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION IN QUESTION HE IS A PRODUCTIVE LABORER BECAUSE HIS SERVICES ARE EMBODIED IN MATERIAL FORM WHEREAS THE LECTURER IS REGARDED AS AN UNPRODUCTIVE LABORER
7505-258958-0031_2764-36619-0017 BUT USED BY THE OWNER AS A DWELLING IT IS CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THE SERVICE IT RENDERS DOES NOT APPEAR IN MATERIAL FORM BUT THE USE OF THE HOUSE OR THAT OF LAND FOR A SCHOOL GROUND OR CAMPUS
7505-258958-0032_6064-56165-0025 AND THUS HIS FELT DEPENDENCE ON GOODS EXTENDS OVER A SERIES OF FUTURE PRODUCTIVE AGENTS IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE ECONOMIC MAN AS LIVING ONLY IN AND FOR THE MOMENT
7505-258958-0033_2518-154826-0042 IF HE HAD NO MORE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION THAN IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE GOODS HERE ONLY PRESENT GOODS COULD HAVE VALUE TO HIM EVEN THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MUCH MORE THE SAVAGES
7505-258958-0034_8088-284756-0074 TO BE USED BY A HUNGRY MAN FOR FOOD FOR A SHEEP TO BE KEPT FOR BREEDING OR FOR WOOL TO BE MADE INTO CLOTH NEXT YEAR HE MAY OVERLOOK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADE OF WANTS COMPARED IN THIS CASE A GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0035_3168-173565-0032 OF THE PRESENT MOMENT IS COMPARED WITH A GRATIFICATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AT A FUTURE TIME THE PROBLEM INVOLVED IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN TIME IN PLACE AND IN THE NATURE OF THE WANT GRATIFIERS
7505-258964-0004_6476-96661-0009 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0008_26-495-0061 THROUGH WHICH FORCE MAY BE INDIRECTLY APPLIED TO MOVE MATTER NO FAST LINE DIVIDES MACHINERY AS REGARDS FORM PURPOSE OR CAUSE OF VALUE FROM THE ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVED NATURAL AGENTS
7505-258964-0010_3486-166424-0023 IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
7505-258964-0011_2092-145706-0024 AND THERE WAS MUCH COMMENT ON THIS EVIDENCE OF A DECLINING INDUSTRY IT WAS NOT AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WAS EMBODIED IN HORSE FLESH MORE HORSE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE
7505-258964-0014_7517-100437-0028 OR AS A BOX OF TOOTH PICKS READY FOR USE IN AN AMERICAN WATCH FACTORY ONE MAN TENDS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AUTOMATIC MACHINES A SMALL BRASS ROD IS FED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE MACHINE
7505-258964-0015_6818-76332-0018 WHERE IT IS READY FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE WATCH AS THE MACHINERY IMPROVES FACTORIES MAKING ALLIED PRODUCTS ARE GROUPED TO MAKE A SYSTEM STILL MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NUMBER OF AGENTS INCREASES
7505-258964-0021_5049-25947-0125 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0022_2691-156745-0004 THAT THE LESS EFFICIENT RENTED AGENTS ARE THROWN OUT OF USE AND THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IS MOVED TO A HIGHER PLANE THAN IT WAS ON BEFORE IMPROVED TYPES OF MACHINERY MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY DISPLACE THE OLDER
7505-258964-0025_441-128988-0010 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0026_2384-152900-0013 SUCH A LUCKY FIND HAS LIFTED THE MORTGAGE FROM A FARM IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHICH IN TWO OR THREE YEARS HAS BEEN TAKEN FELDSPAR EXCEEDING IN VALUE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
7505-258964-0027_6476-57446-0014 OF THE SAME LAND IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE DISCOVERY OF BUILDING STONE COAL NATURAL GAS OR OIL LAND MAY MAKE THE ANNUAL RENT OR ROYALTY
7505-258964-0028_4680-16026-0015 OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
7505-258964-0030_8465-246940-0027 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0031_328-129766-0068 SOCIAL CHANGES ARE CONSTANTLY CAUSING AGENTS TO SHIFT FROM LOWER TO HIGHER USES AS POPULATION GROWS AND GROUPS ABOUT NEW INDUSTRIES FARM LAND IS USED FOR RESIDENCE LOTS
7505-258964-0032_1447-130550-0004 AND IN TURN FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES RENTS THEREFORE RISE AND THIS RISE IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER SELLING VALUE OF THE LAND IF A NEW DEMAND ARISES FOR THE PRODUCT OF ANY MACHINE
7505-258964-0033_3807-4955-0038 ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
7505-258964-0035_6385-34669-0028 IT IS SAID THAT LACE MACHINERY IS SOMETIMES THROWN OUT OF USE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF THE DEMAND FOR LACE CAUSES THE RENTAL TO EQUAL IN TWO YEARS
7505-258964-0036_6531-61334-0007 MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
7505-258964-0037_4813-248641-0003 SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
7505-258964-0038_7059-77900-0010 WILL NOT SELL AS READILY WHEN LESS NEEDED FOR ITS SPECIAL USE AS THAT WHICH LIKE A TURNING LATHE CAN BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BUT THE MORE SPECIAL THE APPLIANCES NEEDED FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT THE HIGHER
7505-258964-0039_39-121915-0011 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
7505-258964-0040_6078-54013-0020 PUTS A CHECK OR SETS A LIMIT TO THE RISE IN THIS SEARCH FOR NEW DEVICES THE MAN WHO CAN SEE MOST QUICKLY AND CLEARLY HAS A KEY TO WEALTH
7505-258964-0041_3983-5371-0031 SOME KINDS OF AGENTS AS RARE MINERALS OR TOOLS THAT CAN BE PRODUCED ONLY BY HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR CANNOT BE INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND REMAIN HIGH IN PRICE FOR A LONG PERIOD
7505-258964-0043_412-126975-0002 WATERWORKS GAS WORKS STREET RAILWAYS FERRIES AND WHARVES THIS EVIDENTLY IS ONLY A SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE JUST STATED WHERE IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN AGENTS
7505-258964-0044_7059-77900-0019 PUBLIC FRANCHISES ENTITLE THE OWNERS TO SPECIAL SOMETIMES EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES AND PROTECT THEM LEGALLY FROM COMPETITION NOT ALL FRANCHISES ARE VALUABLE
7505-258964-0045_6147-34606-0004 MANY STREET RAILWAYS ARE UNFORTUNATE VENTURES THE EARNINGS BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES TO SAY NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY PAY GREATLY
7505-258964-0047_7635-105409-0035 DUE TO ACCIDENTAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES RAISING THE RENTS OF WEALTH THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT MAY BE DEFINED AS AN INCREASE IN RENTS OR VALUE OF AGENTS
7505-83618-0003_7447-91187-0026 YET I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE ONE WAS COPIED OR BORROWED FROM THE OTHER WE CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS IN ADOPTING SUCH A CONCLUSION THE TWO NATIONS WERE REMOTE IN EVERYTHING BUT GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION
7505-83618-0004_412-126975-0076 I CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SIMILAR MYTH IN IT A MOTHER IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TWINS OR A PAIR OF TWINS AND TO HAVE PAID FOR THEM WITH HER LIFE AGAIN THE ONE IS DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT
7505-83618-0006_2436-2477-0026 IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
7505-83618-0008_4441-76250-0013 LIGHT AND LIFE WERE TO HIM SYNONYMOUS THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS PROMISE TO LEAD FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT FROM NIGHT TO HEAVENLY LIGHT THEREFORE HE WHO RESCUES IS EVER THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
7505-83618-0009_250-142276-0006 A MESSIAH FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF MEN FULFILLED IN THAT DAY WHEN HE APPEARED IN GARMENTS SO WHITE AS NO FULLER ON EARTH COULD WHITE THEM
7505-83618-0010_328-129766-0042 LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PROOF OF IT MANY ALGONKIN WORDS FOR EAST MORNING DAWN DAY LIGHT
7505-83618-0012_8098-278252-0023 BUT PACHACAMA ATTACKED AND DROVE HIM TO THE NORTH IRRITATED AT HIS DEFEAT HE TOOK WITH HIM THE RAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THIS DAY THE SEA COAST OF PERU IS LARGELY AN ARID DESERT NOW WHEN WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE SOUTH WIND
7505-83618-0018_441-128988-0021 AND THAT OF MICHABO BOTH PRECEDE AND CREATE THE SUN BOTH JOURNEY TO THE WEST OVERCOMING OPPOSITION WITH THE THUNDERBOLT BOTH DIVIDE THE WORLD BETWEEN THE FOUR WINDS BOTH WERE THE FATHERS GODS AND TEACHERS OF THEIR NATIONS
7505-83618-0019_5808-48608-0013 NOR DOES IT CEASE HERE MICHABO I HAVE SHOWN IS THE WHITE SPIRIT OF THE DAWN VIRACOCHA ALL AUTHORITIES TRANSLATE
7505-83618-0021_4014-186176-0012 I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED OTHERS OF HIS TITLES WERE

7511-102419-0002_6818-68772-0017 TO BEGIN WITH THE MORNING WE LEFT THE HOLTS ELIZABETH SUGGESTED THAT WE THREE WOMEN RIDE IN THE BUCKBOARD SO I SEATED MYSELF ON A ROLL OF BEDDING IN THE BACK PART
7511-102419-0004_4362-15663-0036 THE MOUNTAINS ON ONE SIDE WERE CRESTED GREAT CRAGS AND PILES OF ROCK CROWNED THEM AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE TIMBER GREW ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE TRUNKS OF THE QUAKING ASPENS SHONE SILVERY IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT AND THEIR LEAVES WERE SHIMMERING GOLD
7511-102419-0005_831-130739-0005 AND THE STATELY PINES KEPT WHISPERING AND MURMURING IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE CHIDING THE QUAKING ASPENS FOR BEING FRIVOLOUS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD LAY THE RIVER BORDERED BY WILLOWS AND GRASSY FLATS
7511-102419-0007_5322-7680-0001 AND VERY PRETTY SHE LOOKED IN HER NEAT SHEPHERD'S PLAID SUIT AND NATTY LITTLE WHITE CANVAS HAT VERY SOON SHE SAID I HOPE NEITHER OF YOU WILL MISUNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IF MY HOPES ARE REALIZED I WILL NOT RIDE WITH YOU MUCH LONGER
7511-102419-0010_200-126784-0030 MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY SAID TUT TUT TIS NOTHING AT ALL WE'VE DONE TIS A COMFORT YOU'VE BEEN HASN'T SHE MISSUS STEWART I COULD HEARTILY AGREE AND ELIZABETH WENT ON THE WAY I HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND THE WAY WE ALL TREATED MISSUS HOLT

7511-102419-0027_198-126831-0052 MANLY STRENGTH AND GRACE SHOWING IN EVERY LINE THE ROAD WAS NARROW AGAINST THE HILLSIDE AND HE HAD TO RIDE QUITE CLOSE SO I SAW HIS HANDSOME FACE PLAINLY AS SOON AS HE SAW ELIZABETH HE SPRANG FROM HIS SADDLE AND SAID LIZ'BETH LIZ'BETH
7511-102419-0030_229-130880-0032 BESIDES THAT I SAW THAT ELIZABETH'S HAT WAS ON AWRY HER HAIR IN DISORDER AND HER EYES RED IT WAS DISAPPOINTING AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL TO LOOK NICELY MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY CAME TROTTING ALONG AND WE STOPPED FOR DINNER
7511-102419-0033_6209-34600-0000 WHILE THEY WERE GONE WE HELPED ELIZABETH TO DRESS ALL THE WHILE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS ADMONISHING HER TO NAME HER FIRST GIRUL MARY ELLEN OR SHE SAID
7511-102419-0036_8226-274371-0011 WAITING BESIDE THE ROAD FOR US THEY HAD COME TO PILOT US INTO CAMP FOR THERE WOULD BE NO ROAD SOON SUCH A WAY AS WE CAME OVER SUCH JOLTING AND SLIDING I BEGGED TO GET OFF AND WALK
7511-102419-0037_6000-86686-0016 BUT AS THE WHOLE WAY WAS CARPETED BY STRAWBERRY VINES AND THERE WERE LATE BERRIES TO TEMPT ME TO LOITER I HAD TO STAY ON THE WAGON I HAD NO IDEA A WAGON COULD BE GOT ACROSS SUCH PLACES MISTER STRUBLE DROVE FOR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0038_403-216-0001 AND I COULD HEAR HER IMPLORING ALL THE SAINTS TO PRESERVE US FROM INSTANT DEATH I KEPT SHUTTING MY EYES TRYING NOT TO SEE THE TERRIFYING PLACES AND OPENING THEM AGAIN TO SEE THE BEAUTY SPREAD EVERYWHERE UNTIL MISTER STEWART SAID
7511-102419-0041_6415-116629-0016 LOOK WHO'S HERE SEE WHO'S COME THEY YELLED THEY WENT TO WORK SETTING UP TENTS AND UNLOADING WAGONS WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL WE ARE CAMPED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE PINES BACK OF US RISES A BIG PINE CLAD MOUNTAIN

7511-102419-0054_4406-16882-0046 HE TOLD MISTER HAYNES HE WAS TOO TAM SEEK IN DE BEL SO WE HAD TO COME WITHOUT HIM
7511-102419-0055_5561-39621-0026 AND ARE ALL WILLING TO HELP I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU OF ANY GREAT EXPLOITS I MAKE WITH THE GUN I FIRED ONE THAT MISTER STEWART CARRIES AND IT ALMOST KICKED MY SHOULDER OFF I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S LICENSE
7511-102419-0056_6209-34599-0020 I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
7511-102420-0002_5022-29405-0024 ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME ON THIS HUNT WAS TO TAKE THE TRIP FOR YOU AND TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MOST ENJOY SO I WILL SPEND THIS SNOWY DAY IN WRITING TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL THUNDERSTORM I EVER WITNESSED
7511-102420-0004_3240-131231-0071 ALWAYS APPEAL TO ME BUT THERE WAS NEITHER WIND NOR RAIN JUST FLASH AND ROAR BEFORE THE ECHO DIED AWAY AMONG THE HILLS ANOTHER BOOMING REPORT WOULD SEEM TO SHIVER THE ATMOSPHERE AND SET ALL OUR TINWARE JANGLING
7511-102420-0006_1246-124550-0017 WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0008_6385-34655-0019 AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0010_5750-100289-0032 WE WERE OFF BEFORE IT WAS MORE THAN LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE THE TRAIL DAWN IN THE MOUNTAINS HOW I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IF I COULD ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL THE KEEN BRACING AIR THE EXHILARATING CLIMB
7511-102420-0012_2436-2476-0027 EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0013_8975-270782-0000 THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
7511-102420-0014_8629-261139-0063 THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0018_5561-41615-0041 AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0019_226-131532-0027 WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
7511-102420-0022_7517-100437-0006 BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
7511-102420-0023_3807-4923-0022 THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024_4406-16882-0056 NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0027_83-11691-0043 HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0028_911-128684-0016 TO KEEP THE CAMP ROBBERS FROM PECKING IT FULL OF HOLES NEXT DAY THE MEN WOULD COME WITH THE HORSES AND PACK IT IN TO CAMP WE ALL FELT REFRESHED SO WE STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THOSE THAT GOT AWAY
7511-102420-0029_669-129061-0013 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030_8123-275216-0001 AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0031_7859-102519-0046 WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
7511-102420-0032_460-172359-0008 THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0034_87-121553-0005 IT DIDN'T SEEM A MINUTE BEFORE WE HEARD THE BEAT OF THEIR HOOFS AND A QUEER PANTING NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE FIRST CAME A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH
7511-102420-0037_4267-78186-0026 AND WONDERING WHO HAD STRUCK ME AND FOR WHAT I WAS SO DIZZY I COULD SCARCELY MOVE BUT I GOT DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE EXCITEDLY ADMIRING THE TWO DEAD ELK THAT THEY SAID WERE THE VICTIMS OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S GUN
7511-102420-0038_839-130898-0040 SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039_730-358-0007 I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0040_6078-54013-0044 AND THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR GUN IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF JUST SMASHING YOUR JAW THE MEN WORKED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AT THE ELK AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS WE COULD BUT IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE REACHED CAMP
7511-102420-0042_198-129977-0007 THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0047_226-131532-0003 ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID
7511-102420-0048_3699-47246-0015 MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE

7517-100429-0000_78-368-0052 THE POND MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S POND STANDS AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND IS REACHED BY A WELL DRAINED GRAVEL PATH SO THAT IN ANY WEATHER ONE MAY WALK
7517-100429-0002_2416-152139-0063 A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN IT AND THE BATH OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AT THE ZOO BENEATH THE WATERS OF WHICH IF YOU PARTICULARLY DESIRE TO POINT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS OUT TO SOMEBODY HE ALWAYS LIES HIDDEN TO THE REST OF US
7517-100429-0003_5867-48852-0103 IT IS KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE POND A DESIGNATION WHICH IGNORES THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL NEIGHBOURING PONDS THE GIFTS OF NATURE AND GIVES THE WHOLE CREDIT TO THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
7517-100429-0004_2836-5354-0025 FOR THE POND IS JUST A SMALL ARTIFICIAL AFFAIR OF CEMENT ENTIRELY UNPRETENTIOUS THERE ARE SEVEN STEPS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POND AND EACH STEP
7517-100429-0006_328-129766-0076 WHEN THE POND BEGAN TO FILL TO STRANGERS THIS MAY SEEM SURPRISING AND IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL THEM THE GREAT SECRET WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING LAND
7517-100429-0008_6081-42010-0026 FOR WHEN YOUR WHOLE DAY'S CRICKET HAS BEEN SPOILT IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD
7517-100429-0011_6272-70171-0027 AND PLANNED THE POND ACCORDINGLY A MOST NECESSARY THING IN A COUNTRY HOUSE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECOGNIZED MEETING PLACE
7517-100429-0014_250-140277-0007 RIGHT OH SHE SAYS WILLINGLY ENOUGH HAVING SPENT THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH THE TIMES FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT ALL OF THE PAPER THAT IS LEFT TO THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST RUSH FOR THE CRICKET NEWS
7517-100429-0015_3830-12530-0021 WE WANDER DOWN TO THE POND TOGETHER AND PERHAPS FIND BROWN AND MISS SMITH THERE A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT SAYS BROWN IT WAS ONLY JUST OVER THE THIRD STEP AFTER LUNCH YESTERDAY
7517-100429-0016_8770-295465-0017 WE HAVE A LITTLE ARGUMENT ABOUT IT MISS ROBINSON BEING CONVINCED THAT SHE STOOD ON THE SECOND STEP AFTER BREAKFAST AND MISS SMITH REPEATING THAT IT LOOKS
7517-100429-0018_8108-274318-0013 MUST BE A RECORD BUT ANYHOW IT IS FAIRLY FINE NOW AND WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE LAWN TENNIS OR GOLF OR CROQUET OR AND SO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORNING ARE MADE
7517-100429-0020_4830-25904-0028 FILLS YOU WITH THOUGHTS OF REVENGE FOR YOUR ACCIDENTAL DEFEAT THE EVENING BEFORE BUT INDOORS IT IS SO EASY TO DROP INTO A SOFA AFTER BREAKFAST AND ONCE THERE WITH ALL THE PAPERS
7517-100429-0021_2182-181183-0010 TO BE DISINCLINED TO LEAVE IT TILL LUNCH TIME A MAN OR WOMAN AS LAZY AS THIS MUST NOT BE RUSHED SAY TO SUCH A ONE COME AND PLAY AND THE INVITATION
7517-100429-0023_5463-39174-0023 ALL THIS FOR THOSE DELIGHTFUL SUMMER DAYS WHEN THERE ARE FINE INTERVALS BUT CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF THE POND WHEN THE RAIN STREAMS DOWN IN TORRENTS
7517-100429-0024_4088-158077-0037 FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HOW TIRED WE GET OF BEING INDOORS ON THESE DAYS EVEN WITH THE BEST OF BOOKS THE PLEASANTEST OF COMPANIONS THE EASIEST OF BILLIARD TABLES
7517-100429-0026_4362-15663-0028 ER I WAS JUST GOING TO ER WALK ABOUT A BIT BUT NOW WE TELL HER BRIGHTLY I'M GOING TO SEE THE POND IT MUST BE NEARLY FULL WON'T YOU COME TOO AND WITH ANY LUCK SHE COMES
7517-100429-0028_8580-287363-0006 WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN ALDENHAM MAY KNOW BUT WE HIS GUESTS DO NOT SOME THINK THERE WILL BE MERELY A FLOOD OVER THE SURROUNDING PATHS AND THE KITCHEN GARDEN BUT FOR MYSELF
7517-100429-0030_2007-149877-0027 WILL HELP TO CELEBRATE IT I HAVE NO DOUBT WITH AN OPEN AIR PLAY TANK DRAMA OR WHAT NOT AT ANY RATE WE HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT HE WILL EMPTY THE POND AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
7517-100437-0001_201-122255-0017 I SAY THE SECOND BEST SO THAT IF YOU REMIND ME OF TOM JONES OR THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE OR ANY OTHER THAT YOU FANCY I CAN SAY THAT OF COURSE THAT ONE IS THE BEST
7517-100437-0002_8108-280354-0002 WELL I DISCOVERED HIM JUST AS VOLTAIRE DISCOVERED HABAKKUK OR YOUR LITTLE BOY DISCOVERED SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER DAY AND I COMMITTED MY DISCOVERY TO THE WORLD
7517-100437-0005_2817-142371-0006 MY UNCLE BENJAMIN I READ IT IN THE TRANSLATION EAGER AS I AM TO BE LYRICAL ABOUT IT I SHALL REFRAIN I THINK THAT I AM PROBABLY SAFER WITH TILLIER THAN WITH BUTLER
7517-100437-0007_7226-86965-0019 IN BORROWING THE CLASSIC UPON WHICH YOU WERE BROUGHT UP THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0010_2289-152254-0009 OF A BOOK WHICH SHOULD BE A CLASSIC BUT IS NOT OF A BOOK OF WHICH NOBODY HAS HEARD UNLESS THROUGH ME IT WAS PUBLISHED SOME TWELVE YEARS AGO THE LAST PUBLISHED BOOK
7517-100437-0014_5867-48852-0087 I SHALL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH YOUR GRATITUDE WELL THE WRITER OF MY BOOK IS KENNETH GRAHAME YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM GOOD I THOUGHT SO THE BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
7517-100437-0015_322-124147-0027 ARE THE GOLDEN AGE AND DREAM DAYS AM I NOT RIGHT THANK YOU BUT THE BOOK YOU HAVE NOT READ MY BOOK
7517-100437-0016_233-155990-0019 THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS AM I NOT RIGHT AGAIN AH I WAS AFRAID SO THE REASON WHY I KNEW YOU HAD NOT READ IT IS THE REASON WHY I CALL IT MY BOOK
7517-100437-0020_405-130894-0056 WOULD PROBABLY PRETEND THAT HE HAD READ IT BUT HE WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME FOR ONE CANNOT RECOMMEND A BOOK TO ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS MET IN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DISCOVERING
7517-100437-0023_6454-120342-0022 GREAT ADMIRERS OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS TWO EARLIER FAMOUS BOOKS BUT IGNORANT THEREAFTER I HAD THEIR PROMISE BEFORE THEY LEFT ME AND WAITED CONFIDENTLY
7517-100437-0025_8838-298545-0017 NONE THE LESS THAT YOUR THANKS WERE DUE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A COUPLE OF CASUAL REFERENCES TO IT AS IF IT WERE A CLASSIC KNOWN TO ALL IN A FAMOUS NOVEL
7517-100437-0027_2092-145706-0032 AND RECOMMENDED IT TO KENNETH GRAHAME BUT PERHAPS I AM WRONG HERE FOR I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY LAMENTED AM I FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN ITS SALE
7517-100437-0029_4014-186179-0024 THAT IT IS WHAT I CALL A HOUSEHOLD BOOK BY A HOUSEHOLD BOOK I MEAN A BOOK WHICH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD LOVES AND QUOTES CONTINUALLY EVER AFTERWARDS A BOOK WHICH IS READ ALOUD
7517-100437-0030_4267-287369-0031 TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
7517-100437-0031_6437-66172-0033 WHO REALLY APPRECIATE IT AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND THAT THE OTHERS ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OF IT IT IS OBVIOUS YOU PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING OF YOU
7517-100442-0004_211-122442-0060 APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
7517-100442-0008_2436-2481-0020 AND TO SELL A MAN POTTED LOBSTER IS NOT TO HAVE OUR FINGERS ON HIS PULSE POTTED LOBSTER DOES NOT DEFINE A MAN ALL CUSTOMERS ARE ALIKE TO THE GROCER PROVIDED THEIR MONEY IS GOOD
7517-100442-0014_3857-182315-0024 WITH AMONG OTHERS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN AS SOON AS WE LEFT LIVERPOOL STREET SHE PRODUCED A BAG OF SHRIMPS GRASPED EACH INDIVIDUAL IN TURN FIRMLY BY THE HEAD AND TAIL
7517-100442-0017_6454-93938-0000 CONCEIVE THE HOLY JOY OF THE BOOKSTALL CLERK AS SHE AND HER BAG OF SHRIMPS YES HE COULD HAVE TOLD AT ONCE THEY WERE SHRIMPS APPROACHED AND ASKED FOR THE MORNING POST
7517-100442-0018_2002-139469-0089 THE DAY CAN NEVER BE DULL TO THE BOOKSTALL CLERK I IMAGINE HIM ASSIGNING IN HIS MIND THE RIGHT PAPER TO EACH CUSTOMER THIS MAN WILL ASK FOR GOLFING WRONG
7517-100442-0019_250-142276-0009 HE WANTS CAGE BIRDS THAT ONE OVER THERE WANTS THE MOTOR AH WELL THE AUTO CAR THAT'S NEAR ENOUGH SOON HE WOULD BEGIN TO KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES HE WOULD LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
7517-100442-0020_211-122425-0004 BETWEEN THE PATRONS OF THE DANCING TIMES AND OF THE VOTE THE ERA AND THE ATHENAEUM DELIGHTFUL SURPRISES WOULD OVERWHELM HIM AT INTERVALS AS WHEN
7517-100442-0022_5778-54535-0016 AND THEY WOULD BE VERY RARE HIS FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE WOULD BEGIN TO OOZE AWAY UNTIL ALL AT ONCE HE WOULD TELL HIMSELF EXCITEDLY THAT THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL IN DISGUISE
7517-100442-0023_26-495-0064 RATHER OVERDOING THE PART AFTER WHICH HE WOULD HAND OVER THE WINNING POST AND THE ANIMALS FRIEND TO THE PURSUING DETECTIVE IN A SORT OF HOLY AWE WHAT A LIFE
7517-100442-0025_6385-34669-0005 HE UNDERSTANDS BY NOW THE TYPE OF MAN WHO WANTS TO READ UP A FEW GOOD JOKES TO TELL THEM DOWN AT OLD ROBINSON'S WHERE HE IS GOING FOR THE WEEK END OUR BOOKSTALL CLERK DOESN'T WAIT TO BE ASKED
7517-100442-0027_8108-274318-0033 WHO IS ALWAYS LOSING HIS INDIARUBBER UMBRELLA RING HALF WAY ACROSS THE STATION HE CAN SEE HIM AND HE HASTENS TO GET A NEW CARD OUT IN READINESS OR WE WOULD LET YOU HAVE SEVEN FOR SIXPENCE SIR
7517-100442-0031_6064-56168-0030 I CAME ACROSS A LITTLE BOOK SIXPENCE IN CLOTH A SHILLING IN LEATHER CALLED PROVERBS AND MAXIMS IT CONTAINED SOME THOUSANDS OF THE BEST THOUGHTS IN ALL LANGUAGES

7635-105409-0008_7113-86041-0073 THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
7635-105409-0011_2182-181173-0000 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I THINK CITOYEN THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE NOW REPLIED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IMPERTURBABLY YOU HAVE NOT LET THOSE FOUR MEN GO THUNDERED CHAUVELIN MENACINGLY I ORDERED YOU TO LET NO MAN ESCAPE ALIVE QUICK AFTER THEM ALL OF YOU QUICK IN EVERY DIRECTION
7635-105409-0013_8108-280354-0018 AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
7635-105409-0017_2159-179154-0018 IN THE FAR VERY FAR DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY ECHOING AND ALREADY DYING AWAY THE QUICK SHARP SPLASH OF HALF A DOZEN OARS CHAUVELIN TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE SCHOONER'S BOAT WAS ALL HE GASPED
7635-105409-0024_6563-285357-0015 ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN WHO HAD RUN AFTER THE FUGITIVES WERE NOW SLOWLY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM REACHED CHAUVELIN'S SIDE AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THIS HOPE AROSE IN THE ASTUTE DIPLOMATIST'S HEART
7635-105409-0026_5750-35690-0021 YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST

7635-105409-0032_7447-91187-0007 I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY MUST WAIT FOR ME AT A SAFE DISTANCE OUT AT SEA TILL THEY HEAR THE USUAL SIGNAL DO NOT DELAY AND OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS IMPLICITLY THEN THERE IS THE SIGNATURE CITOYEN ADDED THE SERGEANT AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK TO CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0036_298-126791-0024 AT ANY RATE THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET HIM YET A THOUSAND FRANCS TO EACH MAN WHO GETS TO THAT CREEK BEFORE THAT LONG LEGGED ENGLISHMAN I KNOW OF A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE CLIFFS SAID THE SOLDIER AND WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT HE RUSHED FORWARD FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HIS COMRADES
7635-105409-0038_311-124404-0016 HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
7635-105409-0043_374-180298-0033 I GAGGED HIM AND TIED HIS LEGS TOGETHER AS YOU COMMANDED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY A PLAINTIVE MOAN REACHED CHAUVELIN'S EARS HE FOLLOWED HIS SECRETARY WHO LED THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT
7635-105409-0044_19-227-0011 WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
7635-105409-0046_1334-135589-0001 LIKE A TERRIFIED CHICKEN WHICH LOOKS UPON A LINE OF WHITE CHALK DRAWN ON A TABLE AS ON A STRING WHICH PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS BRING THE COWARDLY BRUTE HERE COMMANDED CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0047_1841-159771-0042 HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
7635-105409-0048_909-131045-0009 WITH TRUE FRENCH CONTEMPT OF THE JEW WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES EVEN TO THIS DAY HE WOULD NOT GO TOO NEAR HIM BUT SAID WITH BITING SARCASM AS THE WRETCHED OLD MAN WAS BROUGHT IN FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON BY THE TWO SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0055_2911-7601-0030 I THINK I CAN RELY ON YOU CITOYEN SOLDIERS LAUGHED CHAUVELIN MALICIOUSLY TO GIVE THIS OLD LIAR THE BEST AND SOUNDEST BEATING HE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BUT DON'T KILL HIM HE ADDED DRILY WE WILL OBEY CITOYEN REPLIED THE SOLDIERS AS IMPERTURBABLY AS EVER
7635-105409-0056_2911-7601-0015 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0057_3830-12535-0026 THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
7635-105409-0058_3259-158083-0016 BUT HE FELT LESS SURE NOW THE ENGLISHMAN'S AUDACITY HAD BAFFLED HIM ONCE WHILST THE WOODEN HEADED STUPIDITY OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE INTERFERENCE OF A WOMAN HAD TURNED HIS HAND WHICH HELD ALL THE TRUMPS INTO A LOSING ONE
7635-105409-0059_3112-9555-0065 IT WAS A LONG IF AND CHAUVELIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL AND ENROLLED THIRTY ODD PEOPLE IN ONE LONG OVERWHELMING ANATHEMA NATURE POETIC SILENT BALMY THE BRIGHT MOON THE CALM SILVERY SEA SPOKE OF BEAUTY AND OF REST
7635-105409-0061_1970-28415-0021 OVERBURDENED AS IT WAS WITH REVENGEFUL MALICE HE SMILED IT EASED HIS MIND TO THINK THAT SOME HUMAN BEING AT LEAST WAS LIKE HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH MANKIND HE TURNED AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE LONELY BIT OF COAST WHERE STOOD THE WOODEN HUT NOW BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
7635-105409-0062_6818-76332-0003 THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
7635-105409-0063_460-172359-0080 WHILE SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON THE UNFORTUNATE JEW WAS RECEIVING ON HIS BROAD BACK THE BLOWS OF TWO STOUT LEATHER BELTS WIELDED BY THE STOLID ARMS OF TWO STURDY SOLDIERS OF THE REPUBLIC THE HOWLS OF BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM WERE FIT TO MAKE THE DEAD RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES
7635-105409-0064_1553-140047-0035 THAT WILL DO COMMANDED CHAUVELIN AS THE JEW'S MOANS BECAME MORE FEEBLE AND THE POOR WRETCH SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY WE DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM
7635-105409-0069_5192-19397-0065 I HAVE NO DOUBT AT DAWN I WILL SEND AN ESCORT FOR YOU UNTIL THEN I FEEL SURE THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM DEVOTED THOUGH PERHAPS A TRIFLE SLOW MARGUERITE ONLY HAD THE STRENGTH TO TURN HER HEAD AWAY HER HEART WAS BROKEN WITH CRUEL ANGUISH
7635-105409-0070_6454-93938-0025 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105409-0071_6367-65536-0058 AU REVOIR FAIR LADY WE MEET I HOPE SOON IN LONDON SHALL I SEE YOU AT THE PRINCE OF WALES GARDEN PARTY NO AH WELL AU REVOIR REMEMBER ME I PRAY TO SIR PERCY BLAKENEY
7635-105661-0000_27-124992-0065 THE PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE FINANCES ARMIES FLEETS AND MAGISTRACY ARE INSTANCES OF THIS ORDER OF MEN IT MAY NATURALLY BE THOUGHT AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE ECCLESIASTICS BELONG TO THE FIRST CLASS AND THAT THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL AS THAT OF LAWYERS AND PHYSICIANS
7635-105661-0002_696-92939-0003 FROM THEIR INCREASING PRACTICE STUDY AND ATTENTION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY WE SHALL FIND THAT THIS INTERESTED DILIGENCE OF THE CLERGY IS WHAT EVERY WISE LEGISLATOR WILL STUDY TO PREVENT BECAUSE IN EVERY RELIGION EXCEPT THE TRUE IT IS HIGHLY PERNICIOUS
7635-105661-0003_730-358-0023 AND IT HAS EVEN A NATURAL TENDENCY TO PERVERT THE TRUE BY INFUSING INTO IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF SUPERSTITION FOLLY AND DELUSION EACH GHOSTLY PRACTITIONER IN ORDER TO RENDER HIMSELF MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED IN THE EYES OF HIS RETAINERS
7635-105661-0004_1246-124548-0039 WILL INSPIRE THEM WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ABHORRENCE OF ALL OTHER SECTS AND CONTINUALLY ENDEAVOR BY SOME NOVELTY TO EXCITE THE LANGUID DEVOTION OF HIS AUDIENCE NO REGARD WILL BE PAID TO TRUTH MORALS OR DECENCY IN THE DOCTRINES INCULCATED
7635-105661-0005_6064-56168-0006 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0007_196-122152-0017 IS TO BRIBE THEIR INDOLENCE BY ASSIGNING STATED SALARIES TO THEIR PROFESSION AND RENDERING IT SUPERFLUOUS FOR THEM TO BE FURTHER ACTIVE THAN MERELY TO PREVENT THEIR FLOCK FROM STRAYING IN QUEST OF NEW PASTURES
7635-105661-0008_5678-43302-0029 AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
7635-105661-0011_7113-86041-0040 THE HIGHER DIGNITIES OF THE CHURCH SERVED INDEED TO THE SUPPORT OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONASTERIES MANY OF THE LOWEST VULGAR WERE TAKEN FROM THE USEFUL ARTS AND MAINTAINED IN THOSE RECEPTACLES OF SLOTH AND IGNORANCE
7635-105661-0012_26-495-0032 THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
7635-105661-0015_1867-154075-0010 SHE EVEN BESTOWED ON EACH INDIVIDUAL PRIEST A POWER OF ENRICHING HIMSELF BY THE VOLUNTARY OBLATIONS OF THE FAITHFUL AND LEFT HIM STILL AN URGENT MOTIVE FOR DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY IN HIS CALLING
7635-105661-0017_4640-19188-0031 THE ADVANTAGES ATTENDING THE ROMISH HIERARCHY WERE BUT A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR ITS INCONVENIENCES THE ECCLESIASTICAL PRIVILEGES DURING BARBAROUS TIMES
7635-105661-0018_445-123857-0030 AND THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF WORSHIP WHICH BELONGED TO SO OPULENT AN ESTABLISHMENT CONTRIBUTED IN SOME RESPECT TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE FINE ARTS AND BEGAN TO DIFFUSE A GENERAL ELEGANCE OF TASTE BY UNITING IT WITH RELIGION
7635-105661-0019_7078-271888-0099 IT WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT THOUGH THE BALANCE OF EVIL PREVAILED IN THE ROMISH CHURCH THIS WAS NOT THE CHIEF REASON WHICH PRODUCED THE REFORMATION A CONCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO FORWARD THAT GREAT REVOLUTION
7635-105661-0020_4397-15678-0023 IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS PROJECTS PLEASURES AND LIBERALITIES THE SCHEME OF SELLING INDULGENCES WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM AS AN EXPEDIENT WHICH HAD OFTEN SERVED IN FORMER TIMES TO DRAW MONEY FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
7635-105661-0021_3807-4955-0023 AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
7635-105661-0022_2384-152900-0004 AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
7635-105661-0023_426-122822-0019 OR SUBDUING SCHISMATICS WHEN THE MONEY CAME INTO HIS EXCHEQUER THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS USUALLY DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT LEO FROM THE PENETRATION OF HIS GENIUS AND HIS FAMILIARITY WITH ANCIENT LITERATURE
7635-105661-0025_412-126975-0043 MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
7635-105661-0029_322-124147-0048 AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
7635-105661-0030_5678-43302-0002 MANY OF THE POWERS INDEED ASSUMED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WERE VERY ANCIENT AND WERE PRIOR TO ALMOST EVERY POLITICAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE
7635-105661-0031_625-132112-0017 WHICH TIME MIGHT RENDER VALID BUT APPEALED STILL TO A DIVINE ORIGIN MEN WERE TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THEIR PRIMITIVE CHARTER AND THEY COULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY PERCEIVE ITS DEFECT IN TRUTH AND AUTHENTICITY
7635-105661-0032_6367-65536-0009 IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
7635-105661-0033_307-127539-0030 CARRIED MATTERS MUCH FURTHER AND TREATED THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS AS ABOMINABLE DETESTABLE DAMNABLE FORETOLD BY SACRED WRIT ITSELF AS THE SOURCE OF ALL WICKEDNESS AND POLLUTION THEY DENOMINATED THE POPE ANTICHRIST
7635-105661-0034_3436-172162-0043 CALLED HIS COMMUNION THE SCARLET WHORE AND GAVE TO ROME THE APPELLATION OF BABYLON EXPRESSIONS WHICH HOWEVER APPLIED WERE TO BE FOUND IN SCRIPTURE AND WHICH WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO OPERATE ON THE MULTITUDE THAN THE MOST SOLID ARGUMENTS
7635-105661-0035_1624-142933-0031 EXCITED BY CONTEST AND PERSECUTION ON THE ONE HAND BY SUCCESS AND APPLAUSE ON THE OTHER MANY OF THE REFORMERS CARRIED TO THE GREATEST EXTREMITIES THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
7635-105661-0036_7800-283493-0014 AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
7635-105661-0038_32-4137-0037 AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0039_3526-176653-0035 IN THOSE POWERS OF WHICH THE ENCROACHING SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAD SO LONG BEREAVED THEM THEY CONDEMNED CELIBACY AND MONASTIC VOWS AND THEREBY OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CONVENTS
7635-105661-0040_7505-258958-0010 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7635-105661-0044_5049-25947-0054 AND SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS CHARACTER BUT SO VIOLENT WERE THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE CHURCH HE RATHER HURT THE CAUSE BY HIS IMPRUDENT EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MANY ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE PRACTICES PREVAILED IN THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0045_2159-179154-0020 AND BY THIS SINCERE AVOWAL HE GAVE OCCASION OF MUCH TRIUMPH TO THE LUTHERANS THIS PONTIFF ALSO WHOSE PENETRATION WAS NOT EQUAL TO HIS GOOD INTENTIONS WAS SEDUCED TO CONCUR IN THAT LEAGUE WHICH CHARLES AND HENRY HAD FORMED AGAINST FRANCE
7635-105661-0047_8108-274318-0016 HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
7635-105661-0048_426-122821-0039 TO THE NEXT ELECTION THE EMPEROR RENEWED THE TREATY MADE AT BRUGES
7635-105661-0049_5049-25947-0055 THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
7780-274562-0000_5652-19215-0024 THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
7780-274562-0001_8108-274318-0040 GILES FLETCHER NO MORE REMARKABLE MAN EVER LIVED THAN MY FRIEND THE YOUNG ELLISON HE WAS REMARKABLE IN THE ENTIRE AND CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS EVER LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE
7780-274562-0004_1263-138246-0023 WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
7780-274562-0007_6925-80680-0005 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MAN THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER CERTAIN UNUSUAL AND HIGHLY FORTUITOUS CONDITIONS MAY BE HAPPY WITH OPINIONS SUCH AS THESE WAS MY YOUNG FRIEND FULLY IMBUED
7780-274562-0008_7402-59171-0022 AND THUS IS IT ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAT THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS LIFE WAS IN GREAT PART THE RESULT OF PRECONCERT IT IS INDEED EVIDENT
7780-274562-0010_4297-13009-0029 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS MY PRESENT OBJECT TO PEN AN ESSAY ON HAPPINESS THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS HE ADMITTED BUT FOUR UNVARYING LAWS
7780-274562-0011_6367-65536-0063 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0017_2182-150130-0035 HIS POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN ALWAYS AMPLE BUT UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ONE AND TWENTIETH YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS OF FATE HAD BEEN PLAYED IN HIS BEHALF WHICH STARTLE THE WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD AMID WHICH THEY OCCUR
7780-274562-0018_8838-298546-0040 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0020_8975-270782-0105 MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
7780-274562-0026_5049-25947-0100 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0029_1034-121119-0030 AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
7780-274562-0031_311-124404-0047 SIX AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT FLEW THUS THE USUAL TRACK OF SUPPOSITION WAS THOROUGHLY BROKEN UP MEN KNEW NOT WHAT TO IMAGINE
7780-274562-0033_332-128985-0057 NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
7780-274562-0034_8747-293952-0036 THE SUPREME MAJESTY AND DIGNITY OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT THE PROPER GRATIFICATION OF THE SENTIMENT HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT TO LIE IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL FORMS OF BEAUTY SOME PECULIARITIES EITHER IN HIS EARLY EDUCATION
7780-274562-0036_6000-55211-0049 AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0038_8014-112602-0016 OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
7780-274562-0040_250-142286-0017 AND MAY IT NOT THUS HAPPEN THAT MANY FAR GREATER THAN MILTON HAVE CONTENTEDLY REMAINED MUTE AND INGLORIOUS I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN AND THAT
7780-274562-0041_7635-105409-0016 UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
7780-274562-0042_7067-76047-0024 OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
7780-274562-0043_163-122947-0002 UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THOSE WHICH INVESTED HIM IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BECOME A PAINTER THE FIELD OF SCULPTURE ALTHOUGH IN ITS NATURE RIGIDLY POETICAL
7780-274562-0046_8468-294887-0020 NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
7780-274562-0047_302-123504-0016 HERE WAS INDEED THE FAIREST FIELD FOR THE DISPLAY OF INVENTION OR IMAGINATION IN THE ENDLESS COMBINING OF FORMS OF NOVEL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0048_332-128985-0065 THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
7780-274562-0049_587-41611-0005 AND IN THE MULTICOLOR OF THE FLOWER HE RECOGNIZED THE MOST DIRECT AND THE MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS OF NATURE AT PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND IN THE DIRECTION OR CONCENTRATION OF THIS EFFORT OR
7780-274562-0050_8465-246947-0022 HE PERCEIVED THAT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYING THE BEST MEANS LABORING TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESTINY AS POET
7780-274562-0054_1578-140045-0004 FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
7780-274562-0056_6019-3185-0105 THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
7780-274562-0057_8838-298546-0019 OF HUMAN LOVELINESS DO MORE THAN APPROACH THE LIVING AND BREATHING HUMAN BEAUTY AS IT GLADDENS OUR DAILY PATH BYRON WHO OFTEN ERRED ERRED NOT IN SAYING I'VE SEEN MORE LIVING BEAUTY
7780-274562-0059_1553-140048-0029 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0060_5339-14134-0018 FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
7780-274562-0061_6181-216552-0098 BUT POSITIVELY KNOWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENTLY ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENTS OF MATTER OR FORM CONSTITUTE AND ALONE CONSTITUTE THE TRUE BEAUTY
7780-274562-0067_8630-305213-0002 IT WAS MISTER ELLISON WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE REGARDED AS IMPROVEMENT OR EXALTATION OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0068_7505-83618-0002 THAT EACH ALTERATION OR DISTURBANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE SCENERY MIGHT POSSIBLY EFFECT A BLEMISH IN THE PICTURE IF WE COULD SUPPOSE THIS PICTURE VIEWED AT LARGE FROM SOME REMOTE POINT IN THE HEAVENS
7780-274562-0070_8975-270782-0084 HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
7780-274562-0072_4441-76262-0029 FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
7780-274562-0073_2136-5143-0013 TO HAVE WELL TREATED THIS THEME THERE ARE PROPERLY HE WRITES BUT TWO STYLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THE NATURAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL
7780-274562-0074_32-4137-0038 ONE SEEKS TO RECALL THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BY ADAPTING ITS MEANS TO THE SURROUNDING SCENERY CULTIVATING TREES IN HARMONY WITH THE HILLS OR PLAIN OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND
7780-274562-0077_2836-5354-0016 IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
7780-274562-0079_7148-82991-0011 A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
7780-274562-0080_8580-287363-0031 CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
7780-274562-0082_8014-112602-0035 THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY IS NEVER SO GREAT AS THAT WHICH MAY BE INTRODUCED OF COURSE MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SELECTION OF A SPOT WITH CAPABILITIES
7780-274562-0086_8014-112586-0002 AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
7780-274562-0087_226-122538-0007 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0088_8108-274318-0047 RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
7780-274562-0090_6880-216547-0064 SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
7780-274562-0094_8770-295462-0011 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0095_696-93314-0062 YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
7780-274562-0097_831-130746-0019 HE SECURES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF INTEREST OR DESIGN WHILE RELIEVING HIS WORK OF ALL THE HARSHNESS AND TECHNICALITY OF ART
7780-274562-0099_8324-286683-0020 NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
7780-274562-0103_6476-96661-0007 IN THE FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR WHICH RESULTED FROM PERSONAL DIRECTION OF HIS PLANS IN THE CONTINUOUS AND UNCEASING OBJECT WHICH THESE PLANS AFFORD
7794-295947-0000_4297-13009-0017 ON THE SAME ERRAND AS THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN SAW THE FOXES THEY PICKED UP A BAMBOO STICK AND TOOK THE CREATURES STEALTHILY IN THE REAR AND WHEN THE OLD FOXES TOOK TO FLIGHT THEY SURROUNDED THEM AND BEAT THEM WITH THE STICK
7794-295947-0003_7800-283492-0011 WELL REPLIED THE OTHER AFTER CONSIDERING THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHOM YOU SELL HIM TO YOU'D BETTER LET ME HAVE HIM OH BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM OUR VILLAGE PROMISED US A GOOD SUM IF WE COULD FIND A FOX
7794-295947-0004_229-130880-0058 AND GOT US TO COME OUT TO THE HILLS AND CATCH ONE AND SO WE CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU AT ANY PRICE WELL I SUPPOSE IT CANNOT BE HELPED THEN BUT HOW MUCH WOULD THE YOUNG MAN GIVE YOU FOR THE CUB OH HE'LL GIVE US THREE HUNDRED CASH AT LEAST
7794-295947-0006_6454-107462-0028 HOW COULD I STAND BY AND SEE LIFE TAKEN IT WAS BUT A LITTLE I SPENT ONLY HALF A BU TO SAVE THE CUB BUT HAD IT COST A FORTUNE I SHOULD NOT HAVE GRUDGED IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTIMATE ENOUGH WITH ME TO KNOW MY HEART
7794-295947-0007_730-358-0029 BUT TO DAY YOU HAVE ACCUSED ME OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND I SEE HOW MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN IN YOU HOWEVER OUR FRIENDSHIP SHALL CEASE FROM THIS DAY FORTH AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FIRMNESS
7794-295947-0008_1235-135887-0011 THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
7794-295947-0010_1069-133709-0008 LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
7794-295947-0011_5688-15787-0028 SO WITH PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS THE LATTER WENT OFF TO ANOTHER PLACE AND CHOOSING A PRETTY SPOT PRODUCED THE WINE BOTTLE AND ATE THEIR NOONDAY MEAL AND AFTER A PLEASANT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES AND BECAME FIRMER FRIENDS THAN EVER
7794-295947-0012_7190-90542-0014 NOW THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED THE FOX'S CUB WAS A TRADESMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD THREE OR FOUR AGENTS AND TWO MAID SERVANTS BESIDES MEN SERVANTS AND ALTOGETHER HE LIVED IN A LIBERAL MANNER HE WAS MARRIED AND THIS UNION HAD BROUGHT HIM ONE SON
7794-295947-0013_6272-70168-0025 EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILD SHOULD DIE FOR IT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT OURSELVES DEPRIVE OTHER CREATURES OF THEIR LIVES BUT YOU WHO LIVE AMONG THE HILLS ARE SURE TO HEAR WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS GO OUT FOX HUNTING
7794-295947-0014_6078-54013-0038 WE DON'T CARE WHAT PRICE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FOX'S LIVER PRAY BUY ONE FOR US AT ANY EXPENSE SO THEY PRESSED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF ON THEIR BEHALF AND HE HAVING PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION WENT HIS WAY
7794-295947-0018_8123-275193-0017 WE MUST MAKE A PRESENT TO THE MESSENGER INDEED SIR I'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR MY TROUBLE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU MUST STOP THE NIGHT HERE THANK YOU SIR I'VE A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE
7794-295947-0019_4406-16882-0016 AND I WILL PASS THE NIGHT WITH HIM AND SO HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT AWAY THE PARENTS LOST NO TIME IN SENDING TO LET THE PHYSICIAN KNOW THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE FOX'S LIVER THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR CAME AND COMPOUNDED A MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT
7794-295947-0020_118-47824-0024 WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE JOY IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD COMMISSIONED TO BUY THE FOX'S LIVER CAME TO THE HOUSE SO THE GOODWIFE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM AND WELCOME HIM
7794-295947-0021_458-126305-0021 HOW QUICKLY YOU FULFILLED OUR WISHES AND HOW KIND OF YOU TO SEND AT ONCE THE DOCTOR PREPARED THE MEDICINE AND NOW OUR BOY CAN GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND IT'S ALL OWING TO YOUR GOODNESS WAIT A BIT CRIED THE GUEST
7794-295947-0022_103-1240-0025 WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE JOY OF THE TWO PARENTS THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH YOU ENTRUSTED ME ABOUT THE FOX'S LIVER TURNED OUT TO BE A MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY SO I CAME TO DAY TO MAKE MY EXCUSES AND NOW I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR
7794-295947-0024_3526-175658-0032 WHICH YOU HAD JUST PROCURED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD COME AND TELL US THE PRICE ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE ASKED HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE HE ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD LODGE WITH A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE AND WENT AWAY THE VISITOR WAS MORE AND MORE LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND
7794-295947-0025_1502-122619-0064 LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
7794-295947-0026_8123-275193-0020 I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
7794-295947-0027_8838-298545-0027 BROUGHT IT TO YOUR HOUSE AND AS SHE SPOKE THE FOX SHED TEARS AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHING TO THANK HER MOVED IN BED UPON WHICH HIS WIFE AWOKE AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT HE TOO TO HER GREAT ASTONISHMENT
7794-295947-0028_1363-139304-0045 WAS BITING THE PILLOW AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHY ARE YOU WEEPING THUS ASKED SHE AT LAST HE SAT UP IN BED AND SAID LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS OUT ON A PLEASURE EXCURSION I WAS THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIFE OF A FOX'S CUB
7794-295947-0029_1578-6379-0023 AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
7794-295947-0032_8312-279791-0017 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
7794-295947-0033_6476-57446-0005 AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN RECITING PRAYERS AND PRAISES AND THE NEXT DAY THEY PUBLISHED THE MATTER TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND TO THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS NOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE INSTANCES OF MEN KILLING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO REQUITE A FAVOUR
7794-295947-0034_328-129766-0041 THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF FOXES HAVING DONE SUCH A THING SO THE STORY BECAME THE TALK OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THE BOY WHO HAD RECOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICACY OF THIS MEDICINE SELECTED THE PRETTIEST SPOT ON THE PREMISES
7794-295947-0035_6836-76549-0021 THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
7794-295947-0036_669-129074-0030 ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE SHRINES OF THE SHINTO OR INDIGENOUS RELIGION ARE CONFIDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOSHIDA AND FUSHIMI
7794-295947-0037_2691-156750-0029 THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
7794-295947-0040_8324-286683-0035 IN CHINA ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MEADOWS AND OTHER ADMIRERS OF THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM A MAN CAN BE WHAT HE PLEASES BY PAYING FOR IT
7794-295947-0042_1841-159771-0038 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOW SUCCESSFULLY STUDYING THE ART OF HEALING AS PRACTISED IN THE WEST WHEN I WAS AT PEKING I SAW A CHINESE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE A DECOCTION OF THREE SCORPIONS FOR A CHILD STRUCK DOWN WITH FEVER
7794-295947-0043_625-132118-0034 AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
7794-295947-0044_3982-178459-0042 FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
7794-295947-0045_481-123720-0015 IF ONLY THE REGION OF THE HEART AND ALL THE PULSES OF THE BODY BE ANOINTED WITH IT IT WILL FREE THE PATIENTS FROM THE EFFECTS OF ALL KINDS OF POISONS TAKEN BY THE MOUTH CORROSIVE ONES EXCEPTED DECOCTIONS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIES WERE MUCH COMMENDED
7794-295947-0046_2691-156745-0023 AND OFTEN PRESCRIBED WITH DUE ACADEMICAL SOLEMNITY AND THE BONES OF THE HUMAN SKULL PULVERIZED AND ADMINISTERED WITH OIL WERE USED AS A SPECIFIC IN CASES OF RENAL CALCULUS SEE PETRI ANDREAE MATTHIOLI OPERA FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7794-295948-0003_6019-3185-0065 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0004_4830-25904-0009 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0007_311-124404-0078 THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
7794-295948-0010_5652-39938-0042 YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
7794-295948-0011_7067-76048-0025 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012_2002-139469-0071 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0017_3830-12535-0020 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018_8088-284756-0058 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0019_5778-54535-0017 REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
7794-295948-0022_3440-171009-0075 FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
7794-295955-0001_7312-92432-0015 BUT IT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON WHICH WAITED FOR AND DEVOURED HIM WHEN SOME DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND THE PRINCES DID NOT RETURN EITHER OF THEM THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN SORROW
7794-295955-0002_2416-152137-0018 THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0003_1116-132847-0018 BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0005_3440-171009-0051 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0006_3436-172171-0029 THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
7794-295955-0008_412-126975-0040 MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
7794-295955-0009_8098-278278-0034 TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
7794-295955-0012_8088-284756-0029 DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
7794-295955-0014_7278-104730-0040 LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
7794-295955-0015_6272-70168-0010 BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
7794-295955-0016_2436-2476-0033 AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0017_7859-102521-0005 COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
7794-295955-0018_8468-294887-0025 IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
7794-295955-0019_150-126107-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
7794-295955-0020_8088-284756-0064 THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
7794-295955-0023_6925-80680-0036 BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0025_2989-138028-0055 THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
7794-295955-0027_201-122255-0004 HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
7794-295955-0028_3857-180923-0016 CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
7794-295955-0031_4137-11702-0047 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN ALL THE TOWN ASSEMBLED AS TO SEE A WONDER THE EMPEROR WHO HAD SEEN ALL HIS HEROISM FROM THE HILL CALLED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO CHURCH HAD THEM MARRIED AND HELD A WEDDING FESTIVAL FOR A WEEK
78-368-0000_1723-141149-0053 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
78-368-0001_839-130898-0069 THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
78-368-0003_2817-142371-0075 THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
78-368-0006_4018-107312-0012 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
78-368-0007_5390-30102-0011 GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
78-368-0008_7078-271888-0070 SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
78-368-0010_83-3054-0015 BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
78-368-0011_229-130880-0002 TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
78-368-0013_8324-286683-0018 AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
78-368-0014_7859-102521-0009 I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
78-368-0015_289-121652-0030 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0018_1970-10594-0005 A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
78-368-0024_8088-284756-0109 THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
78-368-0027_8095-274346-0020 BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
78-368-0028_6367-74004-0001 KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
78-368-0029_118-124588-0001 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0030_5192-19397-0061 MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
78-368-0031_6272-70191-0025 SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
78-368-0033_6818-68772-0044 THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
78-368-0042_5703-47212-0034 FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
78-368-0044_2911-12359-0001 WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
78-368-0049_7148-7763-0018 HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
78-368-0050_6367-74004-0026 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-369-0001_3807-4955-0017 MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
78-369-0004_8312-279791-0049 AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
78-369-0006_3607-29116-0045 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0007_201-122255-0019 AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
78-369-0008_839-130898-0017 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0010_1970-26100-0007 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
78-369-0012_3242-8112-0009 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0013_5322-7679-0011 IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
78-369-0020_8123-275216-0017 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021_27-124992-0077 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0023_3259-158083-0114 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0026_6064-300880-0001 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0028_4853-29413-0009 AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
78-369-0031_1447-130552-0009 AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
78-369-0033_3947-13262-0044 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0034_4788-94904-0004 ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
78-369-0036_6181-216552-0097 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0039_3983-5331-0004 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0040_625-132118-0001 SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
78-369-0044_6880-216547-0012 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0047_696-92939-0035 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0050_1235-135887-0025 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0054_374-180298-0028 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0056_7859-102519-0037 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057_5678-43303-0033 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
78-369-0058_8098-275181-0026 SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
78-369-0059_7302-86815-0015 I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
78-369-0060_8051-118101-0019 BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
78-369-0061_7148-7763-0006 OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO

7800-283492-0021_446-123502-0042 FRANK WAS ALWAYS ACCOMMODATING ESPECIALLY WHEN ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WAS CONCERNED HE LOVED TO WATCH THE SMALL WOODS FOLK WHEN THEY DID NOT SUSPECT HIS PRESENCE AND LEARN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INTERESTING HABITS

7800-283492-0024_6181-216552-0019 TO GO BACK TO THAT OTHER DRUDGERY WOULD HAVE BEEN TORTURE AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND HE INSISTED ON TAKING CHARGE OF THE COOKING AND THE BOYS SOON LEARNED THAT TEDDY COULD MANAGE SPLENDIDLY
7800-283492-0027_4441-76250-0017 WHEN SOME ONE ATTEMPTED TO FIRE THE LOGGING CAMP FRANK OFTEN SAW A WORRIED EXPRESSION COME OVER THE BOY'S FACE AND AT SUCH TIMES HE SUSPECTED THAT TEDDY WAS PUZZLING HIS BRAIN AS TO JUST WHAT HIS DUTY MIGHT BE
7800-283492-0028_412-126975-0067 AND IF HE DOES IT WILL NOT BE THE REWARD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL ON THE SECOND DAY ABOUT NOON SOME OF THE BOYS WERE BUSY NEAR THE CABIN LAYING IN AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF FIREWOOD

7859-102518-0002_4441-76263-0028 HAD STRUCK DEADLY BLOWS AT THE HEART OF EACH OTHER'S EMPIRE AND HARRIED THE INMOST PROVINCES UP TO THE GATES OF EACH OTHER'S CAPITALS THE PERSIAN HAD TURNED THE WILD HORDES OF THE AVARS LOOSE ON THRACE

7859-102518-0010_289-121665-0000 THE TURBULENT POLYTHEISTS OF ARABIA HAD BY HIM BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COMPACT BAND OF FANATICS BURNING TO CARRY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE FORCE OF THEIR SWORDS THEIR NEW WAR CRY THAT
7859-102518-0013_5022-29405-0025 NEGLECTING THE THEOLOGICAL BENT OF HIS MESSAGE AND ONLY THINKING OF ENLISTING A POSSIBLE POLITICAL ALLY BOTH ANSWERS WERE REGARDED AS EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY BY THE PROPHET AND HE DOOMED THE TWO EMPIRES TO A SIMILAR DESTRUCTION
7859-102518-0016_5022-29411-0012 IN THE EARLY ENGAGEMENTS BETWEEN THE EAST ROMANS AND THE SARACENS THE SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND MORE REGULAR ARMS OF THE ONE
7859-102518-0017_40-222-0003 WERE NOT A SUFFICIENT COUNTERPOISE TO PUT AGAINST THE MAD RECKLESSNESS OF THE OTHER THE MOSLEM WANTED TO GET KILLED THAT HE MIGHT REAP THE FRUITS OF MARTYRDOM IN THE OTHER WORLD AND CARED NOT HOW HE DIED IF HE HAD FIRST SLAIN AN ENEMY
7859-102518-0019_1502-122619-0005 AND TO DO SO HAD NOT ONLY DRAINED THE TREASURY BUT IMPOSED SOME NEW AND UNWISE TAXES ON THE HARASSED PROVINCIALS AND DISBANDED MANY OF HIS VETERANS FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY
7859-102518-0020_3168-173564-0037 SYRIA AND EGYPT AFTER SPENDING TWELVE AND TEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PERSIAN YOKE HAD NOT YET GOT BACK INTO THEIR OLD ORGANIZATION

7859-102518-0026_5104-33407-0014 THE ARABS MET THEM AT THE FORDS OF THE HIEROMAX AN EASTERN TRIBUTARY OF THE JORDAN AND A FIERCE BATTLE RAGED ALL DAY THE ROMANS DROVE THE ENEMY BACK TO THE VERY GATES OF THEIR CAMP BUT A LAST CHARGE HEADED BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR KHALED
7859-102518-0027_3526-175658-0011 BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
7859-102518-0028_7113-86041-0089 PARADISE IS BEFORE YOU THE DEVIL AND HELL FIRE BEHIND THE FANATICAL ORIENTALS THREW THEMSELVES ON REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND DROVE IT OFF THE FIELD ALL SYRIA EAST OF JORDAN WAS LOST IN THIS FATAL BATTLE DAMASCUS ITS GREAT STRONGHOLD
7859-102518-0030_8014-112602-0034 AND WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL IN HEALTH HE COULD DO NOTHING EMESA AND HELIOPOLIS WERE SACKED BEFORE HIS EYES AND AFTER AN INGLORIOUS CAMPAIGN HE HURRIED TO JERUSALEM
7859-102518-0031_6209-34601-0019 TOOK THE TRUE CROSS FROM ITS SANCTUARY WHERE HE HAD REPLACED IT IN TRIUMPH FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND RETIRED TO CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102518-0033_32-21634-0012 AND THE AGED OMAR CAME OVER THE DESERT PROUD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY WHICH MAHOMET HAD RECKONED THE HOLIEST SITE ON EARTH SAVE MECCA ALONE THE PATRIARCH SOPHRONIUS WAS COMMANDED TO GUIDE THE CONQUEROR AROUND THE CITY
7859-102519-0001_2893-139310-0029 HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
7859-102519-0012_2691-156745-0016 GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
7859-102519-0013_163-122947-0010 AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
7859-102519-0014_2910-131096-0060 AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
7859-102519-0015_7367-86737-0000 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0016_1963-147036-0007 AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
7859-102519-0017_8226-274369-0042 THE NEW EMPEROR WAS NOT A MAN OF CAPACITY AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO REBELLION BY HIS FEARS RATHER THAN HIS AMBITION HE HELD THE THRONE BARELY THREE YEARS AMID CONSTANT REVOLTS AT HOME AND DEFEATS ABROAD
7859-102519-0018_625-132118-0015 THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0019_5022-29411-0028 WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
7859-102519-0022_3374-298026-0045 THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
7859-102519-0023_8051-295385-0002 WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO EXILE WITH HIS NOSE MUTILATED HE HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO CHERSON THE GREEK TOWN IN THE CRIMEA CLOSE TO THE MODERN SEBASTOPOL WHICH FORMED THE NORTHERNMOST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
7859-102519-0024_730-360-0016 AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
7859-102519-0026_1737-148989-0012 TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
7859-102519-0028_3436-172171-0034 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
7859-102519-0029_5678-43303-0001 WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
7859-102519-0032_1263-141777-0000 AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0033_4397-15666-0004 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
7859-102519-0034_201-122255-0043 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
7859-102519-0035_60-121082-0057 AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
7859-102519-0038_229-130880-0057 AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
7859-102519-0043_3526-176653-0047 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0044_5688-41232-0031 THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
7859-102519-0048_6531-61334-0035 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
7859-102519-0050_6476-96661-0023 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
7859-102519-0051_1069-133709-0007 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052_2416-152139-0025 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0055_3259-158083-0045 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102519-0056_2893-139322-0029 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
7859-102521-0001_2289-152253-0001 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
7859-102521-0003_1553-140048-0010 FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
7859-102521-0004_248-130652-0014 THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
7859-102521-0006_2843-152918-0081 UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
7859-102521-0011_40-222-0068 BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
7859-102521-0012_4088-158077-0038 RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
7859-102521-0014_6529-62556-0002 HER GRAND TREASURER HAVING GAINED OVER SOME OF THE EUNUCHS AND OTHER COURTIERS ABOUT HER PERSON
7859-102521-0015_460-172359-0004 THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
7859-102521-0016_8095-274345-0029 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
8014-112586-0001_307-127539-0036 NINETEEN O SEVEN PRINTED BY PONSONBY AND GIBBS UNIVERSITY PRESS DUBLIN PREFACE
8014-112586-0004_887-123289-0029 THERE ARE MANY ENGLISH AND MANY ANGLO IRISH PEOPLE WHO THINK MERELY FROM IGNORANCE THAT IRELAND WAS A BARBAROUS AND HALF SAVAGE COUNTRY BEFORE THE ENGLISH CAME AMONG THE PEOPLE AND CIVILISED THEM THIS BOOK SO FAR AS IT FINDS ITS WAY AMONG THE TWO CLASSES ABOVE MENTIONED WILL
8014-112586-0005_446-123501-0025 I FANCY OPEN THEIR EYES THEY WILL LEARN FROM IT THAT THE OLD IRISH SO FAR FROM BEING BARBAROUS WERE A BRIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURED PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD PROFESSIONS TRADES AND INDUSTRIES PERVADING THE WHOLE POPULATION
8014-112586-0006_163-121908-0000 WITH CLEARLY DEFINED RANKS AND GRADES OF SOCIETY ALL WORKING UNDER AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF NATIVE LAWS AND THAT IN THE STEADYING AND CIVILISING ARTS AND PURSUITS OF EVERYDAY LIFE THEY WERE AS WELL ADVANCED AS ORDERLY
8014-112586-0012_403-128339-0013 BUT IT IS BETTER NOT TO PURSUE THESE OBSERVATIONS FARTHER HERE AS IT WOULD BE ONLY ANTICIPATING WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE OF WHICH THE SECOND IS ABRIDGED FROM THE FIRST AND THE THIRD FROM BOTH
8014-112586-0013_6000-86686-0008 THE FIRST A SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0016_5778-12761-0038 FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
8014-112586-0017_3607-29116-0035 THIS THIRD BOOK THE STORY OF ANCIENT IRISH CIVILISATION GIVES IN SIMPLE PLAIN LANGUAGE AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE OLDEN TIME BUT AS IT IS HERE TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF I NEED NOT DESCRIBE IT FURTHER
8014-112586-0018_1723-141149-0048 FOR ALL THE STATEMENTS IT CONTAINS FULL AND SATISFACTORY AUTHORITIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE TWO LARGER WORKS I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE ALL THREE READABLE AND INTERESTING AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIVE
8014-112586-0019_4406-16883-0035 THE ORDINARY HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MANY AND THE READER HAS A WIDE CHOICE BUT IN THE MATTER OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY HE HAS NO CHOICE AT ALL FOR THESE THREE BOOKS OF MINE HAVE FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
8014-112602-0003_6078-54013-0033 I SLEEP NO MORE AND I SHALL NOT CRIMSON MY NAILS NO JOY SHALL EVER AGAIN COME UPON MY MIND
8014-112602-0004_1088-129236-0009 LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
8014-112602-0005_4441-76262-0017 THAT THE IRISH MISSIONARY MONKS SOMETIMES PAINTED OR DYED THEIR EYELIDS BLACK AN ENTRY IN CORMAC'S GLOSSARY PLAINLY INDICATES THAT THE BLUSH OF THE CHEEKS WAS SOMETIMES HEIGHTENED BY A COLOURING MATTER OBTAINED FROM THE ALDER TREE
8014-112602-0006_412-126975-0085 AND THE SPRIGS AND BERRIES OF THE ELDER WERE APPLIED TO THE SAME PURPOSE AMONG GREEK AND ROMAN LADIES THE PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL OF PAINTING THE CHEEKS EYEBROWS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FACE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORE THE HAIR LONG
8014-112602-0008_8468-286673-0028 GREAT CARE WAS BESTOWED ON THE HAIR ITS REGULATION CONSTITUTED QUITE AN ART AND IT WAS DRESSED UP IN SEVERAL WAYS VERY OFTEN THE LONG HAIR OF MEN AS WELL AS OF WOMEN WAS ELABORATELY CURLED CONALL KERNACH'S HAIR AS DESCRIBED IN THE STORY OF DA DERGA
8014-112602-0011_1455-138263-0003 THE ACCURACY OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS IS FULLY BORNE OUT BY THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITY OF ALL NAMELY THE FIGURES IN THE EARLY ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AND ON THE SHRINES AND HIGH CROSSES OF LATER AGES
8014-112602-0015_6415-111615-0013 THE MEN WERE AS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEARD AS ABOUT THE HAIR THE FASHION OF WEARING THE BEARD VARIED
8014-112602-0017_8465-246940-0006 IN MOST CASES CURLED UP AND POINTED AT THE ENDS AS WE OFTEN SEE NOW IN MANY THE BEARD IS CAREFULLY DIVIDED INTO SLENDER TWISTED FILLETS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE HAIR KINGS AND CHIEFS HAD BARBERS IN THEIR SERVICE TO ATTEND TO ALL THIS
8014-112602-0018_8098-278252-0032 RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
8014-112602-0023_7312-92432-0019 IN THIS RESPECT THEY RESEMBLED MANY OTHER NATIONS OF ANTIQUITY AS WELL INDEED AS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THEY ILLUSTRATED RUSKIN'S SAYING
8014-112602-0033_4830-25898-0022 LIKE OTHER IRISH GARMENTS IT WAS GENERALLY STRIPED OR SPECKLED IN VARIOUS COLOURS LEGGINGS OF CLOTH OR OF THIN SOFT LEATHER WERE USED AND WERE LACED ON BY STRINGS TIPPED WITH WHITE BRONZE
8014-112602-0037_7447-91186-0011 THEY WORE RINGS AND BRACELETS OF VARIOUS SHAPES ON THE FINGERS INCLUDING THE THUMB ROUND THE WRIST AND FOREARM AND EVEN ROUND THE LEG ABOVE THE ANKLE
8014-112602-0038_374-180298-0022 ALL OF WHICH MATERIALS WERE FOUND NATIVE THEY HAD TORQUES FOR THE NECK MADE OF TWISTED GOLD BARS AND THE ELABORATE AND IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE CRESCENTS OR GORGETS
8014-112602-0039_3947-13262-0001 THERE WAS A GOLD ORNAMENT A KIND OF OPEN RING WITH BOSSES OR BUTTONS ON THE ENDS
8014-112602-0040_5688-41232-0049 WORN ON THE BREAST SUSPENDED FROM AN ORNAMENTED BUTTON THIN CIRCULAR GOLD PLATES WERE ALSO WORN FASTENED ON THE BREAST AND AS FOR BROOCHES THEY WERE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SOME PLAIN SIMPLE AND CHEAP
8014-280382-0000_405-130895-0007 FLED TO LARS PORSENNA KING OF CLUSIUM AND BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM SUFFER NOT THEY SAID THAT WE WHO ARE TUSCANS BY BIRTH SHOULD REMAIN ANY MORE IN POVERTY AND EXILE
8014-280382-0004_248-130697-0001 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0007_26-495-0011 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0009_229-130880-0068 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0011_39-121914-0037 AND AS THE ENEMY STAYED A WHILE FOR FEAR HORATIUS TURNED HIM TO THE RIVER AND SAID O FATHER TIBER I BESEECH THEE THIS DAY WITH ALL REVERENCE THAT THOU KINDLY RECEIVE THIS SOLDIER AND HIS ARMS AND AS HE SPAKE HE LEAPT WITH ALL HIS ARMS INTO THE RIVER

8051-118101-0014_2007-132570-0035 THE MAJOR IN DISPOSITION WAS VERY ABUSIVE AND PROFANE THOUGH OLD AND GREY HEADED HIS WIFE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME KIND OF A WOMAN AS HE WAS A MAN ONE WHO DELIGHTED IN MAKING THE SLAVES TREMBLE AT HER BIDDING
8051-118101-0022_8630-305213-0049 TO WHOM HE MADE KNOWN FULLY THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE AND PEOPLE WHENCE HE HAD FLED THE DANGERS HE WAS EXPOSED TO FROM SLAVE HUNTERS AND THE STRONG HOPE HE CHERISHED OF REACHING FREE LAND SOON

8051-119902-0000_6880-216547-0062 CHAPTER THREE WAR BREAD BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR ALL NATIONS BUT BREAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WHEAT LOAF AT ONE TIME AND PLACE IT HAS BEEN BARLEY CAKE
8051-119902-0001_322-124146-0021 AT ANOTHER OATEN CAKE AND AT ANOTHER CORN PONE BREAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHATEVER CEREAL HAPPENED TO BE CONVENIENT EVEN SUCH UNBREADLIKE FOOD AS RICE IS TO SOME RACES WHAT BREAD IS TO US
8051-119902-0002_8838-298545-0005 WHY THEN HAVE WE DEVELOPED OUR WHEAT BREAD HABIT PARTLY BECAUSE WHEAT BREAD HAS BEEN EASY TO GET AND WE HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE TASTE BUT CHIEFLY BECAUSE WHEAT FLOUR GIVES THE LIGHTEST LOAF
8051-119902-0007_8975-270782-0048 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PRODUCE A WHEATLESS LOAF WHICH IS LIGHT PALATABLE AND SUFFICIENTLY DURABLE TO STAND TRANSPORTATION THE DURABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION CRUMBLY CORN BREAD CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED BY BAKERS NOR SERVED TO ARMIES
8051-119902-0009_196-122159-0008 ALL BAKERS USING THREE OR MORE BARRELS OF FLOUR A MONTH HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND SO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY ALL THE COMMERCIAL BAKERS OF THE COUNTRY
8051-119902-0011_4195-186236-0001 OR IF THEY ARE PASTRY AND CRACKER BAKERS SEVENTY PER CENT THEY MUST MAKE NO BREAD WHOLLY OF WHEAT FLOUR SOME SUBSTITUTE MUST BE MIXED WITH THE WHEAT WHEN THE REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
8051-119902-0013_3857-182317-0027 EVEN THE SIZES OF THE LOAVES ARE FIXED SO THAT THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF MAKING AND HANDLING ALL SORTS OF FANCY SHAPES AND SIZES MAY BE AVOIDED BREAD MUST NOT BE SOLD TO THE RETAILER AT UNREASONABLE PRICES
8051-119902-0014_4898-28461-0058 VICTORY BREAD IS BREAD MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS THE NAME VICTORY WAS CHOSEN AS REPRESENTING THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE CONSERVATION OF WHEAT
8051-119902-0015_4297-13009-0021 THE NAME IS REALLY A PRESENT TO THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION HAVING BEEN USED BY TWO LARGE FIRMS WHO GAVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR TRADE MARK
8051-119902-0017_403-128339-0045 THAT MEANS OF COURSE THAT ONLY THROUGH INTELLIGENT EFFORT CAN THEY SERVE YEAST BREAD
8051-119902-0018_7402-90848-0046 UNTIL THE WHEAT SUPPLY INCREASES AND THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION LESSENS RESTRICTIONS USE NO WHEAT AT ALL IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN MAKE DELICIOUS MUFFINS AND OTHER QUICK BREADS FROM THE SUBSTITUTE FLOURS
8051-119902-0019_8312-279791-0052 AND YOU NEED NO BREAD AT ALL AT SOME MEALS AN EXTRA POTATO OR A SERVING OF RICE CAN BE EATEN INSTEAD OF THE USUAL TWO SLICES OF BREAD AND THE BODY WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY DO NOT BE THE SLAVE OF OLD FOOD HABITS
8051-119902-0020_1841-179183-0035 WHEN ALL EUROPE IS EATING TO KEEP ALIVE FASTIDIOUSNESS AND FOOD NOTIONS MUST PLAY NO PART IN THE DIETARY
8051-119902-0025_5808-48608-0056 IN ENGLAND THERE ARE LOCAL REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF MASHED POTATO IN BREAD THEIR BREAD MUST BE TWELVE HOURS OLD BEFORE IT IS SOLD SO THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO EAT TOO MUCH THE RESULT IS SELDOM PALATABLE
8051-119902-0026_426-122822-0010 IN FRANCE NO FLOUR AT ALL MAY BE USED TO MAKE THE DELECTABLE PASTRIES AND CAKES WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN THE DELIGHT OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND THEIR GUESTS IN ITALY
8051-119902-0028_5390-30102-0005 AND ITSELF MAKES UP THE DIFFERENCE TO THE BAKER ENGLAND HAS APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSE BREAD RATIONS ARE IN FORCE IN BOTH FRANCE AND ITALY
8051-119902-0029_5339-14133-0025 FRANCE HAS RECENTLY PUT HER WHOLE PEOPLE ON A RIGOROUS RATION WHICH LIMITS THEM TO TWO THIRDS OF THE AMOUNT OF BREAD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REMEMBER THAT BREAD IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT PART OF THE FRENCH DIET THAN OF OURS
8051-119902-0030_4160-11549-0027 RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
8051-119902-0032_8975-270782-0098 WASTE OF ANY KIND IS VERY HEAVILY PUNISHED ONE WOMAN WAS FINED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THROWING AWAY STALE BREAD WHY NOT SEND CORN ABROAD
8051-119902-0035_1970-28415-0017 AND THE EXTRA UNACCUSTOMED LABOR OF BREAD MAKING CANNOT BE ADDED TO HER BURDENS WHY WE IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT HAVE BREAD CARDS SOME PEOPLE DISTURBED EITHER SELFISHLY OR PATRIOTICALLY
8051-119902-0036_5393-19218-0043 BY THE FAILURE OF A NEIGHBOR TO CONSERVE WHEAT HAVE ASKED WHY THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION TRUSTS TO VOLUNTARY METHODS WHY IT DOES NOT RATION THE COUNTRY RATIONING MAY COME YET BUT ANY SUCH SYSTEM BRISTLES WITH DIFFICULTIES
8051-119902-0037_446-123501-0040 THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED ALL THE WAY FROM TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY RATIONING
8051-119902-0038_7800-283492-0025 BUT ON THOSE WITH LITTLE TO SPEND WHO MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WHOLE FOOD HABITS THE SUCCESS THAT IS MEETING OUR METHOD OF VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF CONSUMPTION

8051-295385-0037_4830-25898-0043 SUCH WAS THE FAMOUS MOSQUITO WAR ON THE DELAWARE OF WHICH GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN THE HERO BUT THE DEVOUT PEOPLE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDS ALWAYS ASCRIBED THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SWEDES

8088-284756-0011_2764-36617-0028 I MADE THE FOUR MILES IN JUST A SHADE OVER THAT MANY MINUTES AND CLAMPED ON THE BRAKES AS I SAW THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE DRIVE THAT LED TOWARD THE SEA AND MERCER'S ESTATE
8088-284756-0012_5163-39921-0007 WITH GRAVEL RATTLING ON MY FENDERS I TURNED OFF THE CONCRETE AND SWEPT BETWEEN THE TWO MASSIVE STUCCOED PILLARS THAT GUARDED THE DRIVE BOTH OF THEM BORE CORRODED BRONZE PLATES THE BILLOWS THE NAME GIVEN THE MONSTROSITY BY THE ORIGINAL OWNER
8088-284756-0013_4160-11550-0008 A NEWLY RICH MUNITIONS MANUFACTURER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF LOOMED UP BEFORE ME IN A FEW SECONDS A RAMBLING AFFAIR WITH SQUARE SHOULDERED BALCONIES AND A GREAT DEAL OF WROUGHT IRON WORK AFTER THE MOST FLAMBOYANT SPANISH PATTERN IT WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT
8088-284756-0014_696-92939-0025 APPARENTLY EVERY BULB IN THE PLACE WAS BURNING JUST A FEW YARDS BEYOND THE SURF BOOMED HOLLOWLY ON THE SMOOTH SHADY SHORE LITTERED NOW I KNEW BY THE PITIFUL SPOILS OF THE STORM

8088-284756-0025_6415-100596-0021 WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
8088-284756-0027_2911-12359-0004 EVEN IN THE SOFT LIGHT I COULD SEE HER PERFECTLY THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER HER PALE BODY OUTLINED SHARPLY AGAINST THE JADE GREEN TILES I TORE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE STARING CURIOUS EYES OF THE FIGURE IN GOD'S NAME MERCER WHAT IS IT
8088-284756-0030_233-134440-0005 FASCINATED I WATCHED HER HER EYES STARTLINGLY LARGE AND DARK IN THE STRANGELY WHITE FACE WERE FIXED ON MINE THERE WAS NOTHING SINISTER IN THE GAZE YET I FELT MY BODY SHAKING AS THOUGH IN THE GRIP OF A TERRIBLE FEAR
8088-284756-0031_1502-122615-0016 I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
8088-284756-0035_2843-152918-0008 I THINK WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES IF MY PLANS WORK OUT BUT FIRST SLIP ON A BATHING SUIT I DIDN'T ARGUE THE MATTER I LET MERCER LEAD ME AWAY WITHOUT A WORD AND WHILE I WAS CHANGING HE TOLD ME ALL HE KNEW OF THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE POOL
8088-284756-0037_2952-408-0021 I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
8088-284756-0040_250-142276-0033 AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT

8088-284756-0043_7178-34644-0061 I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
8088-284756-0044_5561-39621-0038 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER
8088-284756-0045_2136-5147-0002 CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
8088-284756-0046_1594-135914-0074 WE MOVED OUT OF THE ROOM NOTHING HUMAN CAN LIVE UNDER WATER AND BREATHE WATER AS SHE DOES MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT STARING AT ME ODDLY THE HUMAN RACE HE SAID GRAVELY CAME UP OUT OF SEA THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK
8088-284756-0047_1743-142912-0009 MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
8088-284756-0049_322-124146-0005 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0050_2893-139310-0006 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0056_730-359-0048 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
8088-284756-0057_32-4137-0021 AND IN THE CENTER A SWITCH WITH FOUR CONTACT POINTS A HEAVY SNAKY CABLE LED FROM THIS PANEL TO THE MAZE OF APPARATUS FURTHER ON THIS IS THE CONTROL PANEL EXPLAINED MERCER THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU UNDERSTAND IS IN LABORATORY FORM
8088-284756-0059_8629-261139-0046 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061_6848-252322-0031 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062_3374-298026-0016 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0065_4481-17499-0007 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0066_298-126790-0026 IF WE CAN GET HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE REPLIED MERCER CONFIDENTLY I HAVE ONLY THREE OF THEM I HAD PLANNED SOME THREE CORNERED EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU CARSON AND MYSELF WE'LL LEAVE CARSON OUT OF TO NIGHT'S EXPERIMENT HOWEVER FOR WE'LL NEED HIM TO OPERATE THIS SWITCH
8088-284756-0067_3947-13260-0043 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0069_2159-179154-0036 SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
8088-284756-0072_5678-43302-0037 AS SHE LOOKED UP HER EYES UNMISTAKABLY SOUGHT MINE AND HER SMILE SEEMED WARM AND INVITING SHE MADE AGAIN THAT STRANGE LITTLE GESTURE OF INVITATION WITH AN EFFORT I GLANCED AT MERCER
8088-284756-0073_2159-179154-0031 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0076_1355-39947-0000 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077_32-4137-0041 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0079_7511-102420-0015 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0081_7800-283478-0027 AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
8088-284756-0083_118-47824-0040 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0086_125-121342-0031 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0087_4160-11550-0036 TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
8088-284756-0089_328-129766-0062 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0090_3374-298026-0007 I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
8088-284756-0092_8324-286683-0027 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0094_1502-122619-0058 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095_254-145458-0012 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0098_1578-6379-0009 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0099_5390-30102-0016 AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100_4397-15666-0002 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0103_39-121915-0027 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0105_4160-11550-0023 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0106_7226-86965-0026 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0108_3214-167602-0024 AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
8088-284756-0111_60-121082-0034 ADJUSTED TO HER OWN IDEAS OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE I FLUNG THE INSTRUMENT FROM MY HEAD AND DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I GRIPPED BOTH HER SHOULDERS GENTLY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND FRIENDSHIP MY HEART WAS POUNDING
8088-284756-0115_5688-41232-0053 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116_125-121124-0010 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0117_7402-59171-0024 IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
8088-284756-0118_6437-66173-0055 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8095-274345-0000_8108-280354-0008 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001_332-128985-0074 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0004_3723-171115-0042 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0006_254-12312-0003 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0008_7190-90542-0082 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0010_4441-76263-0030 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0012_6818-68772-0046 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0014_2092-145706-0016 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0016_1263-141777-0010 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0021_5390-30096-0014 AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
8095-274345-0031_4859-26870-0000 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0035_19-227-0071 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274346-0000_4859-22176-0003 CHARLES GAVE THEM A GRACIOUS AND A COMPLIANT ANSWER TO ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
8095-274346-0002_6081-42010-0006 AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0005_2007-132570-0058 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0008_6000-86686-0022 WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0011_4195-17507-0015 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0012_2092-145706-0022 RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0014_8063-274115-0031 HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0017_196-122152-0007 THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0019_3436-172171-0030 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0023_6437-66173-0028 BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0025_1743-142912-0023 THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0027_1088-134315-0056 THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
8095-274346-0029_2391-145015-0070 OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0030_3112-9555-0027 AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
8095-274346-0034_2289-152254-0013 A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035_8630-305213-0023 THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0039_3235-28433-0002 YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
8095-274346-0040_7367-86737-0055 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0044_332-128985-0025 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0046_1502-122619-0096 DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047_39-121915-0008 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0051_4362-15663-0062 THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
8095-274346-0053_1088-129236-0007 THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0054_4340-15220-0062 WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS TO DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
8095-274346-0056_332-128985-0022 WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274348-0000_3374-298025-0005 AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0003_4088-158077-0098 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004_150-126107-0032 HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0006_6019-3185-0044 A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007_26-496-0010 AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0009_32-4137-0010 AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0011_7367-86737-0039 THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
8095-274348-0014_200-124140-0015 IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0016_322-124147-0055 SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8095-274348-0017_7302-86814-0007 HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
8098-275181-0000_5789-57158-0013 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001_1263-139804-0013 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0003_1723-141149-0027 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0006_4680-16042-0009 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0017_3982-178459-0016 AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
8098-275181-0021_5750-100289-0029 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP

8098-275181-0030_6476-57446-0018 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031_1867-154075-0004 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL
8098-278252-0002_7190-90543-0020 THE NEWSPAPER ARTISTS HAD TAXED THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE POD AND MAC

8098-278278-0000_5867-48852-0110 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0001_7278-104730-0034 MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
8098-278278-0002_831-130746-0035 AT THAT TIME IN CRIPPLE CREEK SEVERAL BOYS RANGING FROM A DAY TO SIX WEEKS OLD WHOSE DESTINIES WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROMISING WERE AFFLICTED WITH MY MASTER'S PONDEROUS NAME
8098-278278-0004_211-122425-0016 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0005_3807-4923-0003 AS THE AGED GRANDMOTHER WISHED TO WITNESS IT POD SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED ABOUT ATTENDING SINCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL HIS LATIN
8098-278278-0007_8630-305213-0000 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0008_8108-274318-0022 THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND SURPRISE BECAUSE THE FLATIRONS DIDN'T FLOAT AND THE UNDERTAKER OR WHAT YOU CALL EM OVERTURNED THE BARREL OF WATER AND SET EVERYBODY AFLOAT DRENCHING THE SPONSORS AND GUESTS
8098-278278-0010_1963-147036-0003 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0012_332-128985-0075 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0016_298-126790-0000 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0018_2817-142371-0066 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019_196-122150-0002 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0020_7794-295947-0002 MEASURING UPWARDS OF FORTY FIVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SEVERAL SAWS WERE IMBEDDED IN IT FOR MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO TAKE OFF SOME SLICES FOR THE DENVER EXPOSITION
8098-278278-0021_8580-287364-0049 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0023_7402-90848-0043 BEST TO GO THROUGH THE WOODS SAID THE VALET SO WE WERE HEADED FOR THE TIMBER OUR TRAMP THROUGH THE FOREST I CANNOT SOON FORGET UP AND DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHTS THROUGH THICKETS OF QUAKING ASP AND PINE
8098-278278-0024_1034-121119-0055 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0028_446-123501-0037 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0029_198-129977-0000 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE DONKS WERE PICKETED AND ALLOWED TO GRAZE THEN COONSKIN WENT FISHING HE SAID HE HAD SEEN SOME TROUT IN THE STREAM BY SUPPER TIME HE HAD CAUGHT A NICE MESS
8098-278278-0036_39-121916-0002 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037_7190-90542-0003 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0038_696-93314-0029 THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
8098-278278-0040_1841-179183-0034 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
8108-274318-0000_8088-284756-0085 IT ALL SEEMED SO RAPID AND UNCALCULATED AFTER THAT THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS LITTLE MODERN ROOM AT THE TOP OF PUTNEY HILL BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE THAT DOCTOR SILENCE WAS HARDLY ABLE TO FOLLOW AND REMEMBER IT ALL
8108-274318-0001_5104-33407-0013 IT CAME ABOUT WITH SUCH UNCANNY SWIFTNESS AND TERROR THE LIGHT WAS SO UNCERTAIN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BLACK CAT SO DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ON THE DARK CARPET AND THE DOCTOR HIMSELF SO WEARY AND TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT HE FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
8108-274318-0002_446-123502-0019 TO OBSERVE ACCURATELY OR TO RECALL AFTERWARDS PRECISELY WHAT IT WAS HE HAD SEEN OR IN WHAT ORDER THE INCIDENTS HAD TAKEN PLACE HE NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT DEFECT OF VISION ON HIS PART MADE IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE CAT HAD DUPLICATED ITSELF AT FIRST
8108-274318-0005_103-1241-0011 THE SNARLING OF THE ENRAGED AND TERRIFIED COLLIE SOUNDED SOMETIMES SO FAR AWAY THE CEILING SEEMED TO HAVE RAISED ITSELF SO MUCH HIGHER THAN BEFORE AND MUCH OF THE FURNITURE HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE AND SHIFTED MARVELLOUSLY IT WAS ALL SO CONFUSED AND CONFUSING
8108-274318-0008_1594-135914-0027 WERE THE POOREST POSSIBLE ALLIES TO CAREFUL OBSERVATION AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY AWARE THAT THE DOG WAS REPEATING HIS SHORT DANGEROUS BARK FROM TIME TO TIME SNAPPING VICIOUSLY AT THE EMPTY AIR A FOOT OR SO FROM THE GROUND ONCE INDEED
8108-274318-0009_696-92939-0028 HE SPRANG UPWARDS AND FORWARDS WORKING FURIOUSLY WITH TEETH AND PAWS AND WITH A NOISE LIKE WOLVES FIGHTING BUT ONLY TO DASH BACK THE NEXT MINUTE AGAINST THE WALL BEHIND HIM THEN AFTER LYING STILL FOR A BIT HE ROSE TO A CROUCHING POSITION
8108-274318-0010_4406-16882-0034 AS THOUGH TO SPRING AGAIN SNARLING HORRIBLY AND MAKING SHORT HALF CIRCLES WITH LOWERED HEAD AND SMOKE ALL THE WHILE MEOWED PITEOUSLY BY THE WINDOW AS THOUGH TRYING TO DRAW THE ATTACK UPON HIMSELF THEN IT WAS THAT THE RUSH OF THE WHOLE DREADFUL BUSINESS
8108-274318-0011_426-122822-0024 SEEMED TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE DOG AND DIRECT ITSELF UPON HIS OWN PERSON THE COLLIE HAD MADE ANOTHER SPRING AND FALLEN BACK WITH A CRASH INTO THE CORNER WHERE HE MADE NOISE ENOUGH IN HIS SAVAGE RAGE TO WAKEN THE DEAD BEFORE HE FELL TO WHINING
8108-274318-0019_8609-283227-0033 A MIST LAY OVER HIS MIND AND MEMORY HE FELT DAZED AND HIS FORCES SCATTERED THE DEEPS WITHIN WERE TOO TROUBLED FOR HEALING POWER TO COME OUT OF THEM IT WAS GLAMOUR OF COURSE HE REALISED AFTERWARDS
8108-274318-0020_3807-4955-0028 THE STRONG GLAMOUR THROWN UPON HIS IMAGINATION BY SOME POWERFUL PERSONALITY BEHIND THE VEIL BUT AT THE TIME HE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY AWARE OF THIS AND AS WITH ALL TRUE GLAMOUR WAS UNABLE TO GRASP
8108-274318-0021_8324-286683-0026 BEHIND HIM LIKE WIND BOOMING AND TEARING ITS WAY DOWN THE WINDOWS RATTLED THE CANDLE FLICKERED AND WENT OUT THE GLACIAL ATMOSPHERE CLOSED ROUND HIM WITH THE COLD OF DEATH AND A GREAT RUSHING SOUND SWEPT BY OVERHEAD
8108-274318-0023_6078-54007-0024 THAT SHOOK HIM AS THE TEMPEST SHAKES A LEAF AND CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES CLEAN LEVEL WITH HIS FACE HE FOUND HIMSELF STARING INTO THE WRECK OF A VAST DARK COUNTENANCE A COUNTENANCE THAT WAS TERRIBLE EVEN IN ITS RUIN
8108-274318-0024_233-134440-0059 AND THE MARK OF SPIRITUAL EVIL WAS BRANDED EVERYWHERE UPON ITS BROKEN FEATURES EYES FACE AND HAIR ROSE LEVEL WITH HIS OWN
8108-274318-0025_4160-11550-0033 HE NEVER COULD PROPERLY MEASURE OR DETERMINE THESE TWO A MAN AND A WOMAN LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S VISAGES AND DOWN INTO EACH OTHER'S HEARTS AND JOHN SILENCE THE SOUL WITH THE GOOD UNSELFISH MOTIVE
8108-274318-0026_4830-25898-0028 HELD HIS OWN AGAINST THE DARK DISCARNATE WOMAN WHOSE MOTIVE WAS PURE EVIL AND WHOSE SOUL WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE DARK POWERS IT WAS THE CLIMAX THAT TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF POWER WITHIN HIM AND BEGAN TO RESTORE HIM SLOWLY TO HIS OWN
8108-274318-0029_5163-18515-0049 AND POWER AND CONFIDENCE CAME WITH THEM HE BEGAN TO BREATHE DEEPLY AND REGULARLY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ABSORB INTO HIMSELF THE FORCES OPPOSED TO HIM AND TO TURN THEM TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT
8108-274318-0030_1594-135914-0049 BY CEASING TO RESIST AND ALLOWING THE DEADLY STREAM TO POUR INTO HIM UNOPPOSED HE USED THE VERY POWER SUPPLIED BY HIS ADVERSARY AND THUS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED HIS OWN FOR THIS SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY HE HAD LEARNED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FORCE
8108-274318-0031_302-123504-0024 ULTIMATELY IS EVERYWHERE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS THE MOTIVE BEHIND THAT MAKES IT GOOD OR EVIL AND HIS MOTIVE WAS ENTIRELY UNSELFISH HE KNEW PROVIDED HE WAS NOT FIRST ROBBED OF SELF CONTROL
8108-274318-0035_233-134440-0035 THE PERSPIRATION POURED DOWN HIS FACE THEN BY SLOW DEGREES THE DARK AND DREADFUL COUNTENANCE FADED THE GLAMOUR PASSED FROM HIS SOUL THE NORMAL PROPORTIONS RETURNED TO WALLS AND CEILING THE FORMS MELTED BACK INTO THE FOG
8108-274318-0037_2843-152918-0011 HE MADE CERTAIN SIGILS GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE CONTINUED TO UTTER THESE WORDS UNTIL AT LENGTH THE GROWING VOLUME DOMINATED THE WHOLE ROOM AND MASTERED THE MANIFESTATION OF ALL THAT OPPOSED IT
8108-274318-0041_322-124146-0029 AND THE THUMPING TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF AFFECTION IN THE MAN'S HEART AND GAVE HIM SOME INKLING OF WHAT AGONIES THE DUMB CREATURE HAD SUFFERED NEXT FROM THE SHADOWS BY THE WINDOW A SOMEWHAT SHRILL PURRING ANNOUNCED THE RESTORATION OF THE CAT TO ITS NORMAL STATE
8108-274318-0043_2289-152253-0009 CLEARLY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE MISCHIEF TO WHICH HE HAD UNWITTINGLY LENT HIMSELF OWING TO HIS SUBTLE AND ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION STILL UTTERING HIS SHARP HIGH PURRINGS HE MARCHED UP TO HIS MASTER AND RUBBED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS LEGS
8108-274318-0048_5652-19215-0030 MOST OF THEM CURIOUSLY MISDIRECTED BUT DOCTOR SILENCE FELT INTUITIVELY THAT SOMETHING DISASTROUS HAD HAPPENED AND HIS HEART WAS WRUNG HE STROKED THE DEAR BODY FEELING IT OVER FOR BRUISES OR BROKEN BONES BUT FINDING NONE
8108-280354-0000_7278-246956-0029 JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
8108-280354-0001_7402-59171-0035 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0004_3526-175658-0017 WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
8108-280354-0005_8098-278278-0025 INTO MOST PASSIONATE GRIEF AT HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD LOST HER FOR EVER BUT PRAYED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT CEASING TO THE GODS ABOVE TO RESTORE HER TO HIM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN
8108-280354-0006_7113-86041-0030 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
8108-280354-0009_2196-170379-0001 HERE HE CAME IN SAFETY THROUGH THE CROWD OF GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND STOOD AT LAST BEFORE THE THRONE OF PLUTO AND PROSERPINA THEN HE TOUCHED THE CHORDS OF HIS LYRE AND CHANTED THESE WORDS

8108-280354-0024_8468-286673-0014 FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
8108-280354-0026_2007-149877-0023 AND FELL HARMLESSLY TO THE GROUND THEN THE WOMEN RAISED A WILD SHOUT AND MADE SUCH A CLAMOR WITH TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS THAT THE SOFT TONES OF THE HARP WERE DROWNED BY THE NOISE NOW AT LAST THE SHOTS TOOK EFFECT

8108-280359-0000_887-123291-0016 FOR THE FUTURE HE MUST BEND ALL HIS CUNNING AND VIGILANCE TO THE TASK OF HIDING HIMSELF FROM THE GAZE OF THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO INJURED AND ESCAPING THE JUST PUNISHMENT HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF
8108-280359-0001_7078-271888-0049 THE WORLD IS LARGE AND I AM VERY CLEVER SAID LOKI TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ASGARD AND WANDERED OUT INTO MANHEIM
8108-280359-0002_8226-274371-0052 AND NO MEASURE FOR THE DEEP WATERS NEITHER IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF COUNTING THE VARIOUS FORMS UNDER WHICH I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF ODIN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND ME
8108-280359-0003_7264-92314-0009 I HAVE NO CAUSE TO FEAR BUT THOUGH LOKI REPEATED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID HE WANDERED FAR INTO THE THICK WOODS AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH THE DEEP WATERS
8108-280359-0004_7517-100429-0013 HE CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF MISTY HILLS AND CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF HOLLOW CAVES BUT ABOVE THE WOOD AND THROUGH THE WATER AND DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS A SINGLE RAY OF CALM CLEAR LIGHT SEEMED ALWAYS TO FOLLOW HIM
8108-280359-0006_412-126975-0072 SOMETIMES HE HID HIMSELF AS ONE AMONG A TROOP OF TIMID REINDEER SOMETIMES HE LAY IN THE NEST OF A WOOD PIGEON SOMETIMES HE SWAM A BRIGHT SPOTTED FISH IN THE SEA BUT WHEREVER HE WAS AMONG LIVING CREATURES
8108-280359-0008_7794-295948-0020 AIR EARTH OR WATER THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIM ANYWHERE TIRED AT LAST OF SEEKING WHAT HE COULD NOWHERE FIND LOKI BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE NEAR A NARROW GLITTERING RIVER WHICH LOWER DOWN FLASHED FROM A HIGH ROCK INTO THE SEA BELOW
8108-280359-0009_7148-59157-0023 HE TOOK CARE THAT HIS HOUSE SHOULD HAVE FOUR DOORS IN IT THAT HE MIGHT LOOK OUT ON EVERY SIDE AND CATCH THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GODS WHEN THEY CAME AS HE KNEW THEY WOULD COME TO TAKE HIM AWAY HERE HIS WIFE SIGUNA AND HIS TWO SONS
8108-280359-0012_446-123502-0002 WOULD SPEEDILY HAVE BETRAYED THE HIDING PLACE EVEN IF ODIN'S PIERCING EYE HAD NOT ALREADY FOUND IT OUT AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HOUSE LOOKING ALTERNATELY OUT OF ALL THE FOUR DOORS AND AMUSING HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
8108-280359-0013_6454-93938-0035 BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
8108-280359-0014_298-126790-0038 HE ROSE WITHOUT DARING TO LOOK AGAIN THREW HIS NET ON A FIRE THAT BURNED ON THE FLOOR AND RUSHING TO THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE RIVER HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A SALMON SWAM DOWN TO THE DEEPEST STILLEST POOL AT THE BOTTOM
8108-280359-0016_8630-305213-0037 FAMOUS FOR HIS KEEN SIGHT SPIED OUT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHING NET IN THE FIRE THEN ODIN KNEW AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS A RIVER NEAR AND THAT IT WAS THERE WHERE LOKI HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF HE ORDERED HIS SONS TO MAKE A NEW NET AND TO CAST IT INTO THE WATER
8108-280359-0017_4362-15663-0037 AND DRAG OUT WHATEVER LIVING THING THEY COULD FIND THERE IT WAS DONE AS HE DESIRED THOR HELD ONE END OF THE NET AND ALL THE REST OF THE GODS DREW THE OTHER THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THEY PULLED IT UP THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER IT WAS EMPTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY DISAPPOINTED
8108-280359-0018_32-4137-0044 SAW THAT SOMETHING LIVING HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED THEM THEY THEN ADDED A WEIGHT TO THE NET AND THREW IT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AND DRAGGED UP THE STONES IN THE POOL LOKI NOW SAW THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE NET AND
8108-280359-0019_8468-295198-0030 BUT NOT SO QUICKLY BUT THAT THE GODS SAW HIM KNEW HIM THROUGH HIS DISGUISE AND RESOLVED THAT HE SHOULD NO LONGER ESCAPE THEY THEMSELVES DIVIDED INTO TWO BANDS THOR WADED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0020_1992-141719-0051 THE OTHER GODS STOOD IN A GROUP BELOW LOKI SWAM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THEM FIRST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DART OUT INTO THE SEA AND THEN THAT HE WOULD SPRING OVER THE NET BACK AGAIN INTO THE RIVER THIS LAST SEEMED THE EASIEST WAY OF ESCAPE
8108-280359-0021_4195-186236-0022 AND WITH THE GREATEST SPEED HE ATTEMPTED IT THOR HOWEVER WAS WATCHING FOR HIM AND AS SOON AS LOKI LEAPED OUT OF THE WATER HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND CAUGHT HIM WHILE HE WAS YET TURNING IN THE AIR
8108-280359-0023_3699-47246-0010 AT ODIN'S FIRST SEARCHING LOOK LOKI WAS OBLIGED TO DROP HIS DISGUISE AND COWERING AND FRIGHTENED TO ASSUME HIS PROPER SHAPE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED LORDS ONE BY ONE THEY TURNED THEIR FACES FROM HIM FOR IN LOOKING AT HIM
8108-280359-0024_1723-141149-0094 THEY SEEMED TO SEE OVER AGAIN THE DEATH OF BALDUR THE BELOVED YOU WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE HIGH ROCKS LOOKING OVER THE SEA NEAR LOKI'S HOUSE ONE OF THESE HIGHER THAN THE REST HAD MIDWAY FOUR PROJECTING STONES AND TO THESE THE GODS RESOLVED TO BIND LOKI
8108-280359-0025_6925-80680-0049 BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
8123-275193-0002_78-368-0009 MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
8123-275193-0003_5339-14134-0058 HE WAS A PERFECTLY BLACK PIG OF THE RACER RAZOR BACK ORDER WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE COAST SECTIONS OF THE MORE SOUTHERN OF THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES THEY WERE CALLED RACERS
8123-275193-0004_7148-59157-0004 BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LEGS SLENDER BODIES AND GREAT CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND RAZOR BACKS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE SPINAL COLUMN THE ORIGIN OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF THE PORCINE TRIBE IS UNKNOWN BUT THERE IS A TRADITION TO THE EFFECT
8123-275193-0007_1841-159771-0017 IT WAS DECIDED TO PUT HIM ON A LIGHT DIET OF MILK WHICH PROVED AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS FOR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER HIS FIRST MEAL THE PATIENT BECAME AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE AS DAYS AND WEEKS WENT ON
8123-275193-0010_150-132655-0000 IN THIS ACT OF COURTESY HE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFICER OF THE DECK AND OFTEN BY OTHERS THAT MAY HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND AFTER THE ADVENT OF JEFF WHENEVER I WENT ON BOARD THE LOUISIANA HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE GANGWAY
8123-275193-0011_839-130898-0091 AND SEEMINGLY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT IT MAY BE SAID OF HIM GENERALLY THAT HE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH SPIRITS AND TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ALL THE DAILY ROUTINE WORK OF HIS SHIP
8123-275193-0013_2092-145706-0017 WAS PLAYFUL GOOD NATURED AND EXPRESSED PLEASURE PAIN ANGER AND DESIRE WITH VARIOUS SQUEALS AND GRUNTS DELIVERED WITH A VARIETY OF INTONATIONS THAT WERE VERY EASILY INTERPRETED
8123-275193-0014_909-131041-0025 HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
8123-275193-0021_8975-270782-0085 HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
8123-275193-0022_1502-122619-0040 HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
8123-275193-0026_5322-7680-0032 UNDER THIS TREATMENT POOR JEFF LOST ALL HIS BUOYANCY OF SPIRITS AND HIS HABITUAL FRISKINESS AND BECAME SAD AND DEJECTED BUT BORE HIS TROUBLES WITH PATIENCE HE TOOK TO THE SAND BATHS AT ONCE

8226-274369-0024_3436-172171-0003 THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
8226-274369-0030_911-128684-0076 FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE THIS PROTESTATION WHICH
8226-274369-0031_7190-90542-0019 THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
8226-274369-0032_2289-152258-0023 THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
8226-274369-0034_4406-16883-0044 THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
8226-274369-0036_3259-158083-0071 THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY
8226-274369-0037_1898-145724-0007 THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
8226-274369-0038_1926-147979-0003 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
8226-274369-0039_4813-248638-0012 WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
8226-274369-0041_5322-7680-0016 IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
8226-274369-0043_6181-216552-0101 BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
8226-274369-0044_289-121665-0014 AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
8226-274369-0045_1963-142393-0003 SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274369-0046_4014-186176-0022 THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
8226-274369-0047_2952-408-0018 HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0048_211-122425-0037 WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
8226-274369-0049_7302-86815-0042 BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
8226-274369-0050_4014-186175-0040 MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0052_1970-10594-0028 THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
8226-274369-0056_250-140277-0013 I NEVER DID INTEND ANY FORCE BUT SHALL PROCEED AGAINST THEM IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR
8226-274369-0057_8770-295465-0025 HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR
8226-274369-0058_2196-170379-0025 NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
8226-274369-0059_5778-54535-0002 WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
8226-274369-0060_7302-86814-0021 NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
8226-274369-0063_5703-47212-0002 HE HEARD THE CRY PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT RESOUNDING FROM ALL QUARTERS
8226-274371-0000_1502-122615-0019 YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
8226-274371-0001_2384-152900-0055 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
8226-274371-0003_1502-122615-0017 AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
8226-274371-0005_1034-121119-0004 IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
8226-274371-0007_1578-6379-0041 ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
8226-274371-0008_2092-145706-0041 HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
8226-274371-0009_4859-22176-0006 AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010_229-130880-0013 GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0013_669-129061-0085 THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0014_8838-298546-0049 THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
8226-274371-0015_1926-143879-0011 WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0017_103-1240-0039 THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED
8226-274371-0022_4014-186176-0016 AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
8226-274371-0023_2002-139469-0109 LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
8226-274371-0025_7780-274562-0104 BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0026_4680-16042-0035 TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED
8226-274371-0027_1963-142393-0018 MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
8226-274371-0028_5463-39173-0062 UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
8226-274371-0029_6437-66173-0045 WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD HE SHUT THE GATES AND REFUSED TO RECEIVE THE KING
8226-274371-0030_1963-142393-0016 WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
8226-274371-0031_1867-154075-0003 THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
8226-274371-0032_3607-135982-0026 THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
8226-274371-0034_4340-15220-0097 AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
8226-274371-0037_254-12312-0015 NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0038_3486-166424-0072 THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
8226-274371-0039_2514-149482-0096 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0042_254-127705-0025 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8226-274371-0046_311-124404-0005 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
8238-274553-0002_8425-291444-0018 THREW A PLACE IN HIS REGARD AND HERE WITH SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULTY A PARTIAL INSIGHT INTO HIS MENTAL CONFORMATION IN LATER DAYS THIS INSIGHT GREW MORE CLEAR
8238-274553-0003_1867-154075-0017 WHICH HIS ADVENT EXCITED WITHIN THE COLLEGE PRECINCTS ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE I REMEMBER STILL MORE DISTINCTLY THAT WHILE HE WAS PRONOUNCED BY ALL PARTIES AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0009_4088-158077-0063 HE WAS BY NO MEANS A HANDSOME MAN PERHAPS THE REVERSE THE CONTOUR OF HIS FACE WAS SOMEWHAT ANGULAR AND HARSH HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOFTY AND VERY FAIR HIS NOSE A SNUB
8238-274553-0012_8770-295463-0025 THE STUDY AND THE BUSINESS OF THEIR LIVES FOR THIS SCIENCE A PECULIAR TURN OF MIND GAVE HIM INSTINCTIVELY THE CUE
8238-274553-0013_3235-28452-0033 I QUAINTLY TERMED THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG EVER RIGHTLY ENTERED INTO THE MYSTERY WHICH OVERSHADOWED HIS CHARACTER I TRULY THINK THAT NO PERSON AT THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF
8238-274553-0015_196-122152-0031 THIS TOO WHEN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND UNPARDONABLE OF ALL CONCEIVABLE TRICKS WHIMSICALITIES AND BUFFOONERIES WERE BROUGHT ABOUT IF NOT DIRECTLY BY HIM
8238-274553-0016_229-130880-0072 LAY IN THAT CONSUMMATE ABILITY RESULTING FROM AN ALMOST INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE AND A MOST WONDERFUL SELF POSSESSION
8238-274553-0017_2289-152257-0001 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LAUDABLE EFFORTS HE WAS MAKING FOR THEIR PREVENTION AND FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE GOOD ORDER AND DIGNITY OF ALMA MATER
8238-274553-0021_4853-29413-0002 MY FRIEND APPEARED TO LIVE ONLY FOR THE SEVERITIES OF SOCIETY AND NOT EVEN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD
8238-274553-0022_5778-12761-0028 WITH THE MEMORY OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG
8238-274553-0024_5463-39174-0021 DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT HAD RUN WILD UPON THE ALL ENGROSSING TOPIC OF THE TIMES THE BARON WHO HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY SILENT AND ABSTRACTED IN THE EARLIER PORTION OF THE EVENING
8238-274553-0025_669-129074-0029 AND DWELT UPON THE BENEFITS AND MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THE BEAUTIES OF THE RECEIVED CODE OF ETIQUETTE IN PASSAGES OF ARMS WITH AN ARDOR AN ELOQUENCE
8238-274553-0026_441-130108-0003 AN IMPRESSIVENESS AND AN AFFECTIONATENESS OF MANNER WHICH ELICITED THE WARMEST ENTHUSIASM FROM HIS HEARERS IN GENERAL AND ABSOLUTELY STAGGERED EVEN MYSELF WHO WELL KNEW HIM TO BE AT HEART
8238-274553-0027_5390-30102-0009 A RIDICULER OF THOSE VERY POINTS FOR WHICH HE CONTENDED AND ESPECIALLY TO HOLD THE ENTIRE FANFARONADE OF DUELLING ETIQUETTE IN THE SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT WHICH IT DESERVES
8238-274553-0030_5867-48852-0086 AND I BELIEVE FOR SOME LOGICAL TALENT AS A DUELLIST HE HAD ACQUIRED WHO HAD FALLEN AT HIS HANDS BUT THEY WERE MANY HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE UNDOUBTEDLY
8238-274553-0033_39-121915-0017 I PERCEIVED THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LATTER MOMENTLY INCREASING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE OFFERING SOME OBJECTION TO A POINT INSISTED UPON BY R AND GIVING HIS REASONS IN DETAIL
8238-274553-0034_6836-61804-0012 TO THESE THE BARON REPLIED AT LENGTH STILL MAINTAINING HIS EXAGGERATED TONE OF SENTIMENT AND CONCLUDING IN WHAT I THOUGHT VERY BAD TASTE WITH A SARCASM AND A SNEER
8238-274553-0035_2518-154825-0001 YOUR OPINIONS ALLOW ME TO SAY BARON VON JUNG ALTHOUGH IN THE MAIN CORRECT ARE IN MANY NICE POINTS DISCREDITABLE TO YOURSELF AND TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WHICH YOU ARE A MEMBER
8238-274553-0036_322-124146-0003 I WOULD SAY SIR THAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN AS HERMANN COMPLETED THIS EQUIVOCAL SENTENCE ALL EYES WERE TURNED UPON THE BARON
8238-274553-0038_3526-175658-0025 IT WAS RADIANT WITH THE QUIZZICAL EXPRESSION WHICH WAS ITS NATURAL CHARACTER BUT WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN IT ASSUME EXCEPT WHEN WE WERE ALONE TOGETHER AND WHEN HE UNBENT HIMSELF FREELY IN AN INSTANT AFTERWARD HE STOOD ERECT
8238-274553-0039_7859-102521-0008 FOR A MOMENT I EVEN FANCIED THAT I HAD MISCONCEIVED HIM AND THAT HE WAS IN SOBER EARNEST HE APPEARED TO BE STIFLING WITH PASSION AND HIS FACE WAS CADAVEROUSLY WHITE
8238-274553-0040_8425-291444-0006 FOR A SHORT TIME HE REMAINED SILENT APPARENTLY STRIVING TO MASTER HIS EMOTION HAVING AT LENGTH SEEMINGLY SUCCEEDED HE REACHED A DECANTER WHICH STOOD NEAR HIM SAYING AS HE HELD IT FIRMLY CLENCHED
8238-274553-0041_2518-154826-0052 THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO EMPLOY
8238-274553-0042_5049-25947-0048 IN ADDRESSING YOURSELF TO ME IS OBJECTIONABLE IN SO MANY PARTICULARS THAT I HAVE NEITHER TEMPER NOR TIME FOR SPECIFICATION THAT MY OPINIONS HOWEVER ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN
8238-274553-0043_322-124146-0025 IS AN OBSERVATION SO DIRECTLY OFFENSIVE AS TO ALLOW ME BUT ONE LINE OF CONDUCT
8238-274553-0045_89-219-0045 THIS BEING DONE THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER I SHALL DISCHARGE THIS DECANTER OF WINE AT YOUR IMAGE IN YONDER MIRROR AND THUS FULFIL ALL THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE EXACT LETTER OF RESENTMENT FOR YOUR INSULT
8238-274553-0046_39-121914-0013 WHILE THE NECESSITY OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO YOUR REAL PERSON WILL BE OBVIATED WITH THESE WORDS HE HURLED THE DECANTER FULL OF WINE AGAINST THE MIRROR WHICH HUNG DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HERMANN
8238-274553-0048_831-130739-0056 AS HERMANN WENT OUT THE BARON WHISPERED ME THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW HIM AND MAKE AN OFFER OF MY SERVICES TO THIS I AGREED NOT KNOWING PRECISELY WHAT TO MAKE OF SO RIDICULOUS A PIECE OF BUSINESS
8238-274553-0049_2002-139469-0081 AND TAKING MY ARM LED ME TO HIS APARTMENT I COULD HARDLY FORBEAR LAUGHING IN HIS FACE WHILE HE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY WHAT HE TERMED THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR CHARACTER
8238-274553-0050_7113-86041-0075 AFTER A TIRESOME HARANGUE IN HIS ORDINARY STYLE HE TOOK DOWN FROM HIS BOOK SHELVES A NUMBER OF MUSTY VOLUMES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DUELLO AND ENTERTAINED ME FOR A LONG TIME
8238-274553-0051_5163-18515-0045 THE THEATRE OF HONOR BY FAVYN
8238-274553-0053_481-123720-0041 WITH A FINE MARGIN AND BOUND BY DEROME
8238-274553-0055_887-123289-0022 FROM THIS HE READ ME ONE OF THE DROLLEST CHAPTERS IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0057_8095-274348-0005 ALTHOUGH NOT ONE SYLLABLE OF THE WHOLE MATTER COULD I UNDERSTAND FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVING FINISHED THE CHAPTER HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND DEMANDED WHAT I THOUGHT NECESSARY TO BE DONE I REPLIED THAT I HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS SUPERIOR DELICACY OF FEELING
8238-274553-0059_5652-39938-0001 HAVING PERUSED THE CARTEL HE WROTE THE FOLLOWING REPLY WHICH I CARRIED TO HERMANN SIR THROUGH OUR COMMON FRIEND MISTER P I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR NOTE OF THIS EVENING
8238-274553-0060_289-121665-0005 UPON DUE REFLECTION I FRANKLY ADMIT THE PROPRIETY OF THE EXPLANATION YOU SUGGEST THIS BEING ADMITTED I STILL FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY OWING TO THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR NATURE OF OUR DISAGREEMENT
8238-274553-0061_3857-180923-0006 I HAVE GREAT RELIANCE HOWEVER ON THAT EXTREME DELICACY OF DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS APPERTAINING TO THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
8238-274553-0063_2182-150130-0009 TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ME REFERRING YOU TO THIS ADMIRABLE PASSAGE OUGHT TO SATISFY YOUR REQUEST AS A MAN OF HONOR FOR EXPLANATION WITH SENTIMENTS OF PROFOUND RESPECT YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT VON JUNG
8238-274553-0068_250-142276-0052 HE HANDED ME THE VOLUME AND ASKED ME TO LOOK OVER SOME PORTION OF IT I DID SO BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE NOT BEING ABLE TO GATHER THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MEANING HE THEN TOOK THE BOOK HIMSELF AND READ ME A CHAPTER ALOUD TO MY SURPRISE
8238-274553-0074_7067-76047-0029 HERMANN WOULD HAVE DIED A THOUSAND DEATHS RATHER THAN ACKNOWLEDGE HIS INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD EVER BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE DUELLO
8238-283452-0000_2514-149482-0038 INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
8238-283452-0001_3242-67168-0001 AND INSISTED ON A PROPER SHOW OF RESPECTFUL FEAR ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY HONORED BY HAUNTING A MORTAL WAS EXPECTED TO RISE WHEN A GHOST ENTERED THE ROOM AND IN CASE HE WAS SLOW ABOUT IT
8238-283452-0005_4297-13009-0059 AND HAVE CHIVALROUSLY SPARED THE GENTLER SHADES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW FUNNY CHILD GHOSTS YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY NONE IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF GROWN UPS
8238-283452-0006_4859-26870-0024 THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8238-283452-0008_8095-274346-0006 SINCE ANY LIVING PERSON HOWEVER SENILE WOULD BE THOUGHT JUVENILE COMPARED WITH A TIMELESS SPOOK BUT IN THESE DAYS OF INDIVIDUALISM AND RADICAL LIBERALISM SPOOKS AS WELL AS MORTALS ARE EXPANDING THEIR PERSONALITIES
8238-283452-0009_4406-16883-0028 AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
8238-283452-0013_6147-34607-0037 AT BEST A REVENANT COULD ONLY RATTLE A RUSTY SKELETON OR SHAKE A MOLDY SHROUD OR CLANK A CHAIN BUT AS MORTALS COWERED BEFORE HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HE DIDN'T WORRY
8238-283452-0014_7278-104730-0001 THE UP TO DATE GHOST KEEPS HIS SKELETON IN A GARAGE OR SOME PLACE WHERE IT IS CLEANED AND OILED AND KEPT IN GOOD WORKING ORDER THE MODERN WRAITH HAS SOLD HIS SHEET TO THE OLD CLO'ES MAN AND DRESSES AS IN LIFE
8238-283452-0017_8747-293952-0095 MANY AMERICANS THERE ARE TO DAY WHO WOULD COURT BEING HAUNTED BY THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF RICHARD MIDDLETON'S GHOST SHIP THAT LANDED IN A TURNIP FIELD AND DISPENSED DRINK TILL THEY DEMORALIZED THE DENIZENS OF VILLAGE AND GRAVEYARD ALIKE
8238-283452-0019_1098-133695-0068 HIS JEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TO IT AND HE CAN HAUNT SO INSIDIOUSLY CAN MAKE HIMSELF SO AT HOME IN HIS HOST'S STUDY OR BEDROOM THAT A MAN ACTUALLY WELCOMES A CHAT WITH HIM

83-3054-0000_1970-10594-0027 A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
83-3054-0001_6925-80680-0017 I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
83-3054-0003_441-128982-0008 CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
83-3054-0004_5192-19397-0003 ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
83-3054-0005_3168-173565-0014 FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
83-3054-0006_6880-216547-0096 THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
83-3054-0007_1841-159771-0009 AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
83-3054-0009_6367-65536-0061 I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
83-3054-0010_4853-27670-0032 BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
83-3054-0013_201-122255-0024 AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
83-3054-0017_4014-186176-0013 AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
83-3054-0018_5678-43302-0036 AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
83-9960-0001_7402-90848-0053 THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
83-9960-0002_3259-158083-0051 ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
83-9960-0004_1455-138263-0051 THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
83-9960-0009_7800-283493-0035 THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
83-9960-0010_4014-186179-0000 I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
83-9960-0011_8312-279791-0019 AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
83-9960-0014_2910-131096-0089 IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
83-9960-0015_403-216-0026 MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
83-9960-0016_1723-141149-0042 IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
83-9960-0020_6081-41998-0029 YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
83-9960-0021_3947-13260-0005 AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
83-9960-0023_5463-39174-0006 AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
83-9960-0025_7067-76048-0013 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
83-9960-0029_2843-152918-0037 AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
83-9960-0030_1970-26100-0021 STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
83-9960-0032_5192-19397-0054 ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
83-9960-0038_2092-145706-0005 AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
83-9960-0042_2416-152137-0004 THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
83-9960-0045_2002-139469-0007 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
83-9960-0049_6019-3185-0111 THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
83-9960-0053_322-124146-0017 ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT

831-130739-0007_2952-408-0008 NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT

831-130739-0029_2196-170379-0029 CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
831-130739-0030_441-128988-0033 OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST

8324-286681-0020_4788-94904-0023 ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
8324-286681-0022_3240-131231-0030 AND THEY SAT ON THAT TO REST THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH HAD BEATEN
8324-286681-0024_4853-27671-0039 THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
8324-286682-0008_2518-154825-0004 THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
8324-286682-0010_6415-100596-0005 STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
8324-286682-0011_7447-91187-0019 WHEN THE MINKS VISITED TOGETHER SOMEBODY WAS SURE TO SPEAK OF THE BACHELOR'S LUCK THEY SAID THAT WHATEVER HE DID HE WAS ALWAYS LUCKY IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL THEY SAID
8324-286682-0015_446-123502-0032 HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
8324-286682-0016_8797-294123-0031 HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
8324-286682-0017_3982-178459-0020 BIG BROTHER STOOD IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SNARLED AT THEM AND SHOWED HIS TEETH WITHOUT SMILING AND SAID HE WOULD FIGHT ANYBODY WHO SPOKE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT MINKS ARE VERY BRAVE AND VERY FIERCE
8324-286682-0020_1553-140047-0016 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0021_3242-8112-0032 THEN HE HEARD THE BACHELOR GROAN AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO HE HURRIED UP TO WHERE THE TRAP WAS CAN'T YOU GET OUT SAID HE NO SAID THE BACHELOR I CAN'T THE BEST WAY TO GET
8324-286682-0025_2384-152900-0067 WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
8324-286682-0026_5022-29411-0037 THE BACHELOR WAS TOO BRAVE TO GROAN OR MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE KNEW THERE WAS ANYBODY AROUND TO HEAR BIG BROTHER'S MOUTH BECAME VERY SORE AND HIS STOMACH BECAME VERY EMPTY BUT STILL HE KEPT AT WORK HE WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD
8324-286682-0028_1970-26100-0033 YOU ARE RUMPLING YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR CRIED THE YOUNG MINK NEVER MIND THE FUR ANSWERED THE BACHELOR I CAN SMOOTH THAT DOWN AFTERWARD YOU WILL HAVE TO GNAW A LITTLE ON THIS SIDE
8324-286682-0033_4160-11549-0006 INDEED IT IS SO AMONG ALL THE POND PEOPLE AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT BEING GOOD LOOKING IT IS VERY HARD FOR A YOUNG MINK TO HAVE THE ONE HE LOVES CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER FELLOW
8324-286682-0034_5514-19192-0004 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0037_89-219-0033 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER

8324-286682-0040_302-123504-0018 YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
8324-286682-0041_233-155990-0026 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0042_78-369-0055 AND YOU CAN HAVE LUCK LIKE IT IF YOU REALLY CARE ENOUGH HE LOOKED ALL AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY WAS NEAR AND HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE TWO LITTLE ROUND EARS THAT WERE ALMOST HIDDEN IN HIS HEAD FUR THEN HE WHISPERED TO BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0045_7859-102518-0022 THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN THEIRS IS POOR YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY YOU CAN BEAT IN EVERY FIGHT YOU CAN HAVE SLEEK SHINING FUR
8324-286682-0046_8419-286667-0003 SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
8324-286682-0048_4018-107312-0016 AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286683-0000_2196-170151-0029 ONE WARM DAY IN WINTER WHEN SOME OF THE PUSSY WILLOWS MADE A MISTAKE AND BEGAN TO GROW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME A PARTY OF MUSKRATS WERE VISITING IN THE MARSH BESIDE THE POND ALL AROUND THEM WERE THEIR WINTER HOUSES BUILT OF MUD AND COARSE GRASSES
8324-286683-0002_4014-186175-0021 AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
8324-286683-0003_6454-120342-0013 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
8324-286683-0005_4267-287369-0015 MUD HENS CANNOT BEAR MINKS THEY SAY THAT WHEN A MUD CHICKEN IS MISSING FROM THE NEST
8324-286683-0007_1963-142393-0057 YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
8324-286683-0008_7278-246956-0004 HE KNEW THAT THE FROGS WERE BETTER OFF ASLEEP IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND THAN THEY WOULD BE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE WITH A FEW HUNGRY GULLS ABOVE THEM THE TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ALL WINTER TOO
8324-286683-0012_211-122442-0034 WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
8324-286683-0013_587-54108-0049 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0015_198-129977-0013 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
8324-286683-0019_201-122255-0018 BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
8324-286683-0024_8747-293952-0091 FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
8324-286683-0025_1723-141149-0034 SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
8324-286683-0030_200-126784-0021 OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
8324-286683-0031_7517-100437-0022 BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
8324-286683-0032_19-227-0024 SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
8324-286683-0034_4340-15220-0090 THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
8324-286683-0036_3112-9555-0018 THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
8324-286683-0037_5322-7678-0005 THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
8324-286683-0038_5789-57195-0010 SO THEY WENT AWAY QUIETLY TO PLAY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THEY MUST BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO PLAY THOSE GAMES WHEN ALL THE OTHERS WERE HAVING A FINE TIME IN THE SUNSHINE
839-130898-0002_2416-152137-0025 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE SAINT LAWRENCE IN DESPAIR
839-130898-0003_8609-262281-0006 POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
839-130898-0004_8238-283452-0007 SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
839-130898-0006_7447-91186-0021 WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER
839-130898-0007_5688-41232-0022 SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
839-130898-0008_481-123720-0001 OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS
839-130898-0010_6081-41998-0012 AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
839-130898-0011_887-123290-0016 THE HUNGARIAN THE CANADIAN THE ANGLO SAXON THE HUMBOLDT
839-130898-0012_6019-3185-0035 ALL RUN AGROUND BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW
839-130898-0013_3723-171115-0023 OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
839-130898-0020_4340-15220-0003 AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES
839-130898-0022_1363-139304-0014 MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD
839-130898-0025_4137-11701-0044 THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
839-130898-0027_5703-47198-0026 THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
839-130898-0028_696-92939-0037 CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK
839-130898-0029_7226-86964-0022 YOU COULD CALL THESE COD MOUNTAIN FISH WHILE THE NAUTILUS WAS CLEARING A PATH THROUGH THEIR TIGHT RANKS
839-130898-0031_6209-34599-0017 AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
839-130898-0032_8609-283227-0011 BAH MY FRIEND THERE'D BE MANY MORE WITHOUT THEIR ENEMIES SCORPIONFISH AND HUMAN BEINGS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE FEMALE I'LL GO ALL OUT CONSEIL REPLIED
839-130898-0039_8630-305213-0052 I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
839-130898-0045_200-126784-0006 THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
839-130898-0047_3982-178459-0008 FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRIC TONS AND WAS SHIPPED ABOARD THE GREAT EASTERN THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FAILED NOW THEN
839-130898-0049_5022-29411-0010 THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
839-130898-0052_1034-121119-0041 WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
839-130898-0053_1355-39947-0036 YET THERE WAS ONE HITCH AS THEY GRADUALLY UNROLLED THIS THIRD CABLE THE ELECTRICIANS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN NAILS INTO IT TRYING TO DAMAGE ITS CORE
839-130898-0057_1081-125237-0060 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0059_4362-15663-0044 I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH
839-130898-0061_587-54108-0004 THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE
839-130898-0063_1898-145720-0002 BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0067_7264-92314-0020 TWO THOUSAND METERS HIGH WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0074_1363-139304-0011 THAT HAD ME DEEPLY PUZZLED IT SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A LOCALITY THAT IT HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING AT NOON
839-130898-0079_7517-100437-0021 WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE AND AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH
839-130898-0084_625-132118-0025 THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
839-130898-0085_6385-220959-0032 I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
839-130898-0087_7190-90543-0033 OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR OFF TIME TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS
839-130898-0088_1743-142914-0010 THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
839-130898-0089_7059-77897-0014 I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT NEXT TO ME I HEARD CAPTAIN NEMO'S VOICE SLOWLY SAY ORIGINALLY THIS SHIP WAS CHRISTENED
839-130898-0090_5750-100289-0069 IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX
839-130898-0093_412-126975-0016 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
839-130898-0094_3607-29116-0026 WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR
8419-286667-0001_196-122150-0006 OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
8419-286667-0002_2910-131096-0038 THEY WERE A FINE COMPANY TO LOOK UPON ORDERLY STRONG AND DIGNIFIED THEIR LONG NECKS WERE STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT AHEAD THEIR LONG LEGS STRAIGHT BEHIND AND THEY BEAT THE AIR WITH SLOW REGULAR STROKES OF THE STRONG WINGS
8419-286667-0006_1723-141149-0040 THEY WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT OF STAYING THERE FOR THE SUMMER WHEN THE FLOCK AROSE TO FLY ON AGAIN EIGHT CRANES STAYED BEHIND THEY WATCHED THEIR FRIENDS FLY AWAY AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR NECKS AND BILLS UPLIFTED AND MOUTHS OPEN
8419-286667-0008_8063-274112-0024 AND ONE CRANE KEPT AWAKE TO WATCH FOR DANGER WHILE THE OTHERS TUCKED THEIR HEADS UNDER THEIR WINGS THEY WERE FINE LOOKING EVEN WHEN THEY SLEPT AND SOME PEOPLE NEVER LOOK WELL UNLESS THEY ARE AWAKE THEY WERE BROWNISH GRAY WITH NO BRIGHT MARKINGS AT ALL
8419-286667-0013_4297-13006-0026 WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
8419-286667-0014_7067-76047-0038 SHE STOOD WITH HER HEAD ON HER BREAST AND LOOKED AT THE WATER AFTER A WHILE HE TRUMPETED SOFTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE JUST TRYING HIS VOICE THEN SHE GAVE A PRETTY LITTLE START AND SAID OH ARE YOU HERE HOW YOU DID FRIGHTEN ME
8419-286667-0015_8465-246947-0017 I AM SORRY HE SAID I DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN YOU AND HE LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY IT WAS JUST FOR A MINUTE SHE ANSWERED
8419-286667-0017_8747-293952-0076 THEN HE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE LIKED THE PLACE SO WELL SHE MIGHT COME THERE AGAIN THE NEXT DAY HE WONDERED WHY HE COULD NOT COME TOO ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT A CRANE CATCHES MORE IF HE FISHES ALONE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE CRANES DANCED
8419-286667-0018_1116-137572-0031 HE BOWED TO HER OFTENER THAN TO ANY OF THE REST AND HE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED IT THEY DANCED UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED TO MOVE
8419-286667-0021_118-47824-0027 STILL ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUCH A YOUNG CRANE AND HAD NEVER DANCED UNTIL THIS YEAR HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SHE LIKED HIM AND ENJOYED HAVING HIM NEAR SO HE FLEW OFF TO THE FISHING PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN HER THE DAY BEFORE AND HE STALKED ALONG TO WHERE SHE WAS
8419-286667-0022_6818-76332-0014 HE PITIED SHORT NECKED PEOPLE THEN HE SAID POOH I CAN TAKE BIGGER MOUTHFULS THAN THAT YOU OUGHT TO SEE WHAT BIG MOUTHFULS I CAN TAKE SHE CHANGED AND STOOD ON HER OTHER LEG I SAW YOU DANCING THIS MORNING SHE SAID
8419-286667-0024_6147-34606-0005 WHEN A CRANE IS AS MUCH EXCITED AS THAT IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS TO MY SISTER SHE ASKED CARELESSLY AS SHE DREW ONE OF HER LONG TAIL FEATHERS THROUGH HER BEAK NO SAID HE I BOWED TO HER SISTER
8419-286676-0002_3486-166446-0010 AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
8419-286676-0003_2391-145015-0004 AFTER THAT I SHALL FLY AWAY ON MY WEDDING TRIP MISSUS BELOSTOMA MAY GO WITH ME IF SHE FEELS LIKE DOING SO AFTER LAYING HER EGGS HERE I SHALL GO ANYWAY AND I SHALL FLUTTER AND SPRAWL AROUND THE LIGHT AND STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHER ME AND HAVE A HAPPY TIME
8419-286676-0004_6880-216547-0098 THAT WAS BELOSTOMA'S WAY HE WOULD STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHERED HIM BUT THEN HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY NEED NOT HAVE BOTHERED HIM AND PERHAPS THAT WAS SO WITH THE WATER ADDERS IT WAS DIFFERENT THEY WERE GOOD NATURED ENOUGH
8419-286676-0005_1898-145724-0006 YET THE MUD TURTLES AND SNAPPING TURTLE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO EVER CALLED UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM AT HOME THE SMALL PEOPLE WITHOUT SHELLS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND THE CLAMS AND POND SNAILS NEVER CALLED UPON ANY ONE THE MINNOWS SAID THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOKS OF THE ADDERS
8419-286676-0007_1334-135589-0011 THE ADDERS WERE ALWAYS AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT THE ADDERS WERE AFRAID OF THEM THE YELLOW BROWN FROG WISHED THAT THE ADDERS COULD BE SCARED BADLY SCARED SOME TIME SO SCARED THAT A CHILLY FEELING WOULD RUN DOWN THEIR BACKS FROM THEIR HEADS CLEAR TO THE TIPS OF THEIR TAILS
8419-286676-0009_311-124404-0031 BUT PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE ADDERS HAD FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG SO THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE FELT SO THE WATER ADDERS WERE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE POND
8419-286676-0012_8975-270782-0026 WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH

8419-293469-0014_5750-100289-0004 THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SMALLER CREATURES SEEMED TO MAKE THE LARGER ONES DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED THEM TO THEY EVEN MADE SOME OF THEM HELP DO THEIR WORK YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME BUT WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE
8419-293469-0016_8324-286683-0017 THERE WERE SOME BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS NEAR THE HOUSE AND I CRAWLED IN AMONG THEM THERE I RESTED UNTIL SUNSET AND THEN BEGAN MY EVENING SONG WHILE I WAS SINGING ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND FOUND ME

8419-293473-0002_4898-20016-0038 THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
8419-293473-0003_1455-134435-0046 AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT

8419-293473-0010_3526-176653-0024 THAT WAS BECAUSE HE CRAWLED INTO A CLUMP OF FERNS AND KEPT VERY STILL HIS SISTER CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY A SPIDER IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE SIX LEGS AGAIN
8419-293473-0011_254-127705-0010 OF COURSE YOU KNOW SPIDERS NEVER DO HAVE A HUNDRED AND A WALKING STICK WOULDN'T BE WALKING WITHOUT ANY BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF SPEAKING AND IT SHOWED WHAT KIND OF INSECT HE WAS HIS RELATIVES ALL WAVED THEIR FEELERS ONE AT A TIME AND SAID
8419-293473-0012_5652-19215-0048 AH HE HAS THE TRUE WALKING STICK SPIRIT THEN THEY PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE AND HIS SISTER AND THEIR GREEN LITTLE FRIEND LEFT THE FOREST FOR THE MEADOW ON THE DAY WHEN THE GRASS WAS CUT THEY HAD SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR TREES AND LOOKED GENTEEL
8419-293473-0015_587-41619-0017 WHEN THE HORSE WAS WELL INTO THE MEADOW THE FARMER MOVED A BAR AND THE QUEER LOOKING MACHINE BEGAN TO KICK THE GRASS THIS WAY AND THAT WITH ITS MANY STIFF AND SHINING LEGS A FRISKY YOUNG GRASSHOPPER KICKED IN THE SAME WAY AND HAPPENED JUST HAPPENED OF COURSE

8419-293473-0020_4397-15666-0013 THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
8425-246962-0001_4267-78186-0027 TO THE FINAL EXECUTION OF THE LAW SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD FOLLOW IT ALL IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS COUNTENANCE AT A CERTAIN POINT THE COLD DEW ALWAYS APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD
8425-246962-0003_7148-59157-0034 WAS AMAZING IN ITS BEAUTY FOR HELEN HERSELF SHE WAS PREY TO A HOST OF CHANGEFUL EMOTIONS AT ONE TIME SHE ACCUSED HERSELF BITTERLY OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE RETURN OF HIS ILLNESS
8425-246962-0004_7511-102419-0049 THE NEXT A GUSH OF GLADNESS WOULD SWELL HER HEART AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE HAD HIM AT LEAST SAFER FOR A WHILE AND THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND SO ESCAPE THE WHOLE CROWD OF HORRIBLE POSSIBILITIES
8425-246962-0006_2007-132570-0024 BUT AMONGST THE REST A FEELING WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO INDICATE ITS FAR OFF PRESENCE NOW THREATENED TO BRING WITH IT A DEEPER AND MORE PERMANENT SORROW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO HER
8425-246962-0007_1578-140045-0017 THAT SHE HAD TAKEN THE EVIL PART AGAINST THE ONE SHE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS A SATAN TO HIM HAD DRIVEN HIM BACK STOOD ALMOST BODILY IN THE WAY TO TURN HIM FROM THE PATH OF PEACE
8425-246962-0011_2391-145015-0104 AND WHILE SHE FEARED AND SHRANK FROM THE SEVERITY OF WINGFOLD SHE COULD NOT HELP A CERTAIN INDISCRIBABLE SENSE OF SAFETY IN HIS PRESENCE AT LEAST SO LONG AS LEOPOLD WAS TOO ILL TO TALK FOR THE CURATE
8425-246962-0013_1963-147036-0011 BUT TO SO MANY OF THE SECRET CHAMBERS OF THE SOULS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR WHAT A MAN DARES NOT COULD NOT IF HE DARED AND DARED NOT IF HE COULD SAY TO ANOTHER EVEN AT THE TIME AND IN THE PLACE FITTEST OF ALL
8425-246962-0014_730-359-0023 HE CAN SAY THENCE OPEN FACED BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AND THE PERSON IN NEED THEREOF MAY HEAR IT WITHOUT UMBRAGE OR THE CHOKING HUSK OF INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION IRRITATING TO THE REJECTION OF WHAT TRUTH MAY LIE IN IT FOR HIM
8425-246962-0015_426-122821-0028 THEN WOULD MEN SOON UNDERSTAND THAT NOT THE FORM OF EVEN SOUNDEST WORDS AVAILETH ANYTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE WHEN WINGFOLD WAS IN THE PULPIT THEN HE COULD SPEAK AS FROM THE SECRET TO THE SECRET BUT ELSEWHERE HE FELT
8425-246962-0018_625-132118-0011 AND ALL THEIR GRACE WHEN UTTERED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNRECEPTIVE NATURE AND THEY HEAR AS IT WERE THEIR OWN VOICE REFLECTED IN A POOR DULL INHARMONIOUS ECHO AND ARE DISGUSTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
8425-246962-0020_1088-134318-0019 WAS A KIND OF REVELATION TO HELEN FOR WHILE HIS INTELLECT WAS HANGING ABOUT THE DOOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND UNEASILY SHIFTING HITHER AND THITHER IN ITS UNLOVED PERPLEXITIES
8425-246962-0024_4680-16042-0038 NO HARM WOULD FOLLOW WAS A MAN NEVER TO TALK FROM THE HIGHEST IN HIM TO THE FORGETTING OF THE LOWER WAS A MAN NEVER TO BE CARRIED BEYOND HIMSELF AND THE REGIONS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IF SO THEN FAREWELL POETRY AND PROPHECY
8425-246962-0027_1116-137572-0036 BUT HE FELT RIGHT HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WERE HE BASE ENOUGH TO DENY HIM ANY COCK MIGHT CROW HIM BACK TO REPENTANCE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF HE GAVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED
8425-246962-0029_1069-133709-0021 AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
8425-246962-0030_4051-10927-0021 HE HAD MUCH TIME FOR REFLECTION AS HE SAT SILENT BY THE BEDSIDE OF LEOPOLD SOMETIMES HELEN WOULD BE SITTING NEAR THOUGH GENERALLY WHEN HE ARRIVED SHE WENT OUT FOR HER WALK BUT NEVER ANYTHING CAME TO HIM HE COULD UTTER TO HER
8425-287387-0000_2764-36616-0024 CHAPTER EIGHT DUCO VAN DER STAAL HAD TAKEN A LARGE VAULT LIKE STUDIO WITH A CHILLY NORTH LIGHT UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN THE VIA DEL BABUINO HERE HE PAINTED MODELLED AND STUDIED
8425-287387-0001_125-121124-0045 IN THE LITTLE SHOPS ALONG THE TIBER OR IN THE MERCATO DEI FIORI THAT WAS HIS PASSION TO HUNT THROUGH ROME FOR A PANEL OF AN OLD TRIPTYCH OR A FRAGMENT OF ANCIENT SCULPTURE
8425-287387-0002_6147-34605-0006 IN THIS WAY HIS STUDIO HAD NOT REMAINED THE LARGE CHILLY VAULT LIKE WORKROOM BEARING WITNESS TO ZEALOUS AND SERIOUS STUDY BUT HAD BECOME A REFUGE FOR DIM COLOURED REMNANTS OF ANTIQUITY
8425-287387-0003_7800-283493-0003 AND ANCIENT ART A MUSEUM FOR HIS DREAMING SPIRIT ALREADY AS A CHILD AS A BOY HE HAD FELT THAT PASSION FOR ANTIQUITY DEVELOPING HE LEARNT HOW TO RUMMAGE THROUGH THE STOCKS OF OLD JEWISH DEALERS
8425-287387-0004_4297-13009-0012 HE SPENT ALL HIS POCKET MONEY ON IT AND LATER WITHOUT RESERVE THE LITTLE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO EARN FOR SOMETIMES VERY SELDOM HE WOULD FINISH SOMETHING AND SELL IT
8425-287387-0005_4813-248641-0047 WHEN HE HAD THE MONEY TO KEEP HIMSELF GOING AND HIS PERSONAL NEEDS WERE VERY SMALL HE FELT RICH AND WAS CONTENT IN HIS STUDIO OR WOULD WANDER PERFECTLY CONTENT THROUGH THE STREETS OF ROME
8425-287387-0007_6848-252323-0000 HE WOULD WANDER FOR HOURS THROUGH THE RUINS AND SEE IN A DAZZLING VISION OF PHANTOM COLUMNS ETHEREAL TEMPLES AND TRANSLUCENT MARBLE PALACES LOOMING UP IN A SHIMMERING SUNLIT TWILIGHT AND THE TOURISTS GOING BY WITH THEIR BAEDEKERS
8425-287387-0010_6880-216547-0029 THE TEMPLES ROSE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE BASILICAS SHOT UP AS BY MAGIC THE GRAVEN IMAGES STOOD WHITE AGAINST THE ELUSIVE DEPTHS OF THE SKY AND THE VIA SACRA BECAME ALIVE

8425-287387-0014_163-122947-0048 AND THE BROWNS AND GREYS WERE SO RICHLY AND NOBLY GILDED BY SPLASHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RUINS WERE SO EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL IN DECAY SO MELANCHOLY IN THEIR UNWITTING FORTUITOUSNESS OF BROKEN LINES
8425-287387-0016_3259-158083-0123 AND HE WENT AWAY THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS BY THE COLOSSEUM THROUGH THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE
8425-287387-0019_3168-173564-0000 AND EVEN AS HE LOVED ROAMING ALONE AMONG THE RUINS AND ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS SO HE CHERISHED THE PRIVACY OF HIS LONELY STUDIO WITH THE MANY SILENT FIGURES ON AN OLD PANEL OF SOME TRIPTYCH
8425-287387-0020_3699-175950-0020 ON A TAPESTRY OR ON THE MANY CLOSELY HUNG SKETCHES ALL AROUND HIM ALL WITH THE CHARM OF THEIR LINES
8425-287387-0022_730-358-0037 AND THE OLD LEATHER BINDINGS OF HIS BOOKS STOOD IN COMFORTABLE BROWN ROWS READY TO GIVE FORTH WHEN HIS HANDS OPENED THEM IMAGES WHICH MISTILY DRIFTED UPWARDS LIVING THEIR LOVES AND THEIR SORROWS IN THE TEMPERED BROWNS AND REDS AND GOLDS
8425-287387-0023_1624-168623-0000 OF THE SOUNDLESS ATMOSPHERE OF THE STUDIO SUCH WAS HIS SIMPLE LIFE WITHOUT MUCH INWARD DOUBTING BECAUSE HE MADE NO GREAT DEMANDS UPON HIMSELF AND WITHOUT THE MODERN ARTIST'S MELANCHOLY

8465-246940-0022_4441-76250-0019 AND THE CREATURE HE HAS MADE AND IF GOD HEARD THE MAN'S PRAYER AND FORGAVE HIM THEN THE MAN WOULD CERTAINLY KNOW IT IN HIS HEART AND BE CONSOLED PERHAPS BY THE GIFT OF HUMILITY
8465-246940-0023_3699-19402-0021 THEN YOU THINK CONFESSION TO GOD IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IF THERE BE NO ONE ELSE WRONGED TO WHOM CONFESSION CAN BE MADE IF THE CASE WERE MINE
8465-246940-0024_289-121652-0008 AND SOMETIMES I MUCH FEAR THAT IN TAKING HOLY ORDERS I HAVE GRIEVOUSLY SINNED I SHOULD THEN DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE WITH REGARD TO THAT CRY TO THE LIVING POWER WHICH I THINK ORIGINATED ME TO SET THE MATTER RIGHT FOR ME
8465-246940-0029_298-126790-0041 I KNOW THAT SO LONG AS WE HANG BACK FROM DOING WHAT CONSCIENCE URGES THERE IS NO PEACE FOR US I WILL NOT SAY OUR PRAYERS ARE NOT HEARD FOR MISTER POLWARTH HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THE MOST PRECIOUS ANSWER PRAYER CAN HAVE
8465-246940-0030_302-123504-0036 LIES IN THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE TOWARDS THE DREADED DUTY AND IN THE EVER SHARPER STINGS OF THE CONSCIENCE I THINK I ASKED ALREADY WHETHER THERE WERE NO RELATIVES TO WHOM REPARATION COULD BE MADE YES YES GASPED HELEN
8465-246942-0000_4397-15678-0010 SHE HAD SOUGHT THE DOOR OF PARADISE AND THE DOOR OF HELL HAD BEEN OPENED TO HER IF THE FRIGHTFUL IDEA WHICH SHE DID NOT DOUBT HAD ALREADY SUGGESTED ITSELF TO LEOPOLD SHOULD NOW BE ENCOURAGED THERE WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK MADNESS BEFORE HER
8465-246942-0002_201-127786-0072 BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
8465-246942-0004_150-132655-0027 AGONIES OF INJURY A MAN MAY ENDURE AND SO FAR FROM BEING OVERWHELMED RISE ABOVE THEM TENFOLD A MAN WHO WERE HE TO AWAKE TO THE SELF KNOWLEDGE OF A CRIME WOULD SINK INTO A HEAP OF RUIN
8465-246942-0006_8123-275193-0006 HELEN DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT GULFS OF PERSONAL SHAME NAY TO WHAT SUMMITS OF PUBLIC EXECRATION A MAN MAY BE GLAD TO FLEE FOR REFUGE FROM THE FANGS OF HOME BORN GUILT IF SO BE THERE IS ANY REFUGE TO BE FOUND IN EITHER
8465-246942-0007_426-122821-0034 AND SOME KIND OF REFUGE THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STRANGE IT IS AND TRUE THAT IN PUBLICITY ITSELF LIES SOME RELIEF FROM THE GNAWING OF THE WORM AS IF EVEN A CURSING HUMANITY WERE A BARRIER OF PROTECTION BETWEEN THE TORN SOUL AND ITS CRIME
8465-246942-0008_103-1241-0024 IT FLEES TO ITS KIND FOR SHELTER FROM ITSELF HENCE I IMAGINE IN PART MAY THE COOLNESS OF SOME CRIMINALS BE ACCOUNTED FOR THEIR QUIETNESS IS THE RELIEF BROUGHT BY CONFESSION EVEN CONFESSION BUT TO THEIR FELLOWS
8465-246942-0009_8123-275216-0013 IS IT THAT THE CRIME SEEMS THEN LIFTED A LITTLE FROM THEIR SHOULDERS AND ITS WEIGHT SHARED BY THE ACE HELEN HAD HOPED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN IN PUBLIC SO TENDERLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SO POWERFULLY OF THE SAVING HEART OF THE UNIVERSE
8465-246942-0013_1081-125237-0050 HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN DREARILY OF DUTY HINTING AT A HORROR THAT WOULD PLUNGE THE WHOLE ANCIENT FAMILY INTO A HELL OF DISHONOUR AND CONTEMPT
8465-246942-0014_2952-410-0005 SKELETONS THEY WERE AND NO HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL HER FATHER
8465-246942-0019_2952-408-0029 BUT ALAS WHAT SECURITY HAD SHE THAT A MAN CAPABLE OF SUCH PRIESTLY SEVEIRITY AND HEARTLESSNESS
8465-246942-0020_2182-181173-0024 NO SHE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER SOONER WOULD SHE GO TO GEORGE BASCOMBE FROM WHOM SHE NOT ONLY COULD LOOK FOR NO SPIRITUAL COMFORT BUT WHOSE THEORIES WERE SO CRUEL AGAINST CULPRITS OF ALL SORTS
8465-246942-0022_4406-16883-0026 AND THEN SERVE HER AS THE CURATE HAD DONE IT WAS INDEED SHAMELESS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TREATED A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN LIKE THAT AND AS SHE SAID THUS TO HERSELF AGAIN THE WORDS SOUNDED IN THE EAR OF HER HEART
8465-246942-0023_2764-36617-0014 COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST WHENCE CAME THE VOICE FROM HER MEMORY OR FROM THAT INNER CHAMBER OF THE SPIRIT WHICH THE ONE SPIRIT BEARING SPIRIT
8465-246942-0024_1970-28415-0025 KEEPS FOR HIS OWN IN EVERY HOUSE THAT HE BUILDS ALAS SO LONG IN MOST HUMAN HOUSES SHUT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE ROOMS AND FORGOTTEN OR RECOLLECTED WITH UNEASINESS AS A LUMBER CLOSET IN WHICH LIE TOO MANY THINGS THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE LOOKED INTO
8465-246942-0026_8098-275181-0013 HELEN WAS ON HER KNEES WITH HER HEAD ON THE CHAIR YET ONCE MORE CRYING TO THE HEARER OF CRIES POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE BEING SHE KNEW NOT IN THE LEAST BUT WORDS REPORTED OF HIM HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE CRY TO HELP HER IN HER DIRE NEED
8465-246943-0000_6081-41997-0023 HELEN ROSE AND HASTENED TO HER BROTHER WITH A HEART OF LEAD IN HER BODY SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM SOME CHANGE HAD PASSED ON HIM SINCE THE MORNING
8465-246943-0002_4853-27670-0006 BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE APPEARED MORE WASTED AND PINCHED AND DEATH LIKE THAN SHE HAD YET SEEN HIM OR WAS IT ONLY IN HER EYES WAS SHE BUT READING IN HIS FACE THE AGONY SHE HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH THAT DAY HELEN HELEN HE CRIED AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
8465-246943-0003_4051-11217-0041 WHAT WAS THAT POLDIE ASKED HELEN WITH A PANG OF FEAR WHY THOSE WORDS OF COURSE WHAT ELSE YOU SANG THEM TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HELEN
8465-246943-0004_7402-90848-0052 DON'T YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
8465-246943-0006_19-227-0026 IS THERE NO HELP OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE SURELY MISTER WINGFOLD COULD TELL ME SOMETHING COMFORT ME SOMEHOW IF I WERE TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT I COULD TRUST THE MAN THAT SAID SUCH THINGS AS THOSE YOU TOLD ME THAT I COULD
8465-246943-0009_5322-7679-0006 NOT IF I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LEOPOLD HISSED FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP DOWN A SHRIEK NO NOT IF YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING SHE ANSWERED AND FELT LIKE A JUDGE CONDEMNING HIM TO DEATH
8465-246943-0012_426-122821-0016 FOR WHAT ATTEMPT EVEN HAD HE MADE TO COMFORT HER WHAT HAD HE DONE BUT UTTER COMMON PLACES AND TRUISMS ABOUT DUTY AND WHO COULD TELL BUT
8465-246943-0019_4051-10927-0013 THAT I FEEL ENCOURAGED TO DOUBT WHETHER EVER THERE WAS A MAN ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT HOPE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ALAS ARE MANY WHO ARE AWARE OF NO GROUND OF HOPE NAY EVEN WHO FEEL NO GLIMMER IN THEM OF ANYTHING THEY CAN CALL HOPE I KNOW
8465-246943-0020_3699-19401-0017 BUT I THINK IN THEM ALL IS AN UNDERLYING UNCONSCIOUS HOPE I THINK THAT NOT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD HAS MORE THAN A SHADOWY NOTION OF WHAT HOPELESSNESS MEANS PERHAPS UTTER HOPELESSNESS IS THE OUTER DARKNESS
8465-246943-0023_307-127535-0021 I KNOW WHAT FANCY IS AS WELL AS ANY MAN OR WOMAN BORN THAT WAS NO FANCY SHE STOOD THERE BY THE WARDROBE IN THE SAME DRESS HER FACE AS WHITE AS HER DRESS AND LISTEN I WILL TELL YOU
8465-246943-0025_6836-61804-0029 HERE THE FIXED LOOK OF HORROR THREATENED TO RETURN UPON HIS FACE BUT HE WENT ON LISTEN
8465-246943-0029_32-4137-0013 BUT LEOPOLD SEEMED NOT TO HEAR A WORD SHE SAID AND LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL
8465-246947-0000_730-360-0028 AS WINGFOLD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM WHICH WAS NEAR THE STAIR HELEN ROSE FROM THE TOP OF IT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN WITH HER BROTHER HE CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM AND STEPPED SOFTLY ALONG THE LANDING
8465-246947-0001_7511-102419-0024 A HUMAN SOUL IN GUILT AND AGONY IS AN AWFUL PRESENCE BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN THAT IN THE HUSH OF THE CURATE HE FELT AS IF HE HAD LEFT THE PHYSICIAN OF SOULS BEHIND HIM AT THE BEDSIDE
8465-246947-0005_8324-286683-0033 I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
8465-246947-0006_5778-12761-0029 BUT WHEN A MAN IS ONCE OVERWHELMED IN HIS OWN DEEDS WHEN THEY HAVE TURNED INTO SPECTRES TO MOCK AT HIM WHEN HE LOATHES HIMSELF AND TURNS WITH SICKNESS FROM PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE I KNOW BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT
8465-246947-0009_4051-11217-0015 THE DWARF EXCLAIMED HELEN SHUDDERING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT THE COTTAGE YES THAT MAN'S SOUL IS AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND PATIENT AS HIS BODY IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DISTORTED AND TROUBLED
8465-246947-0011_1578-6379-0003 HER LOVE AND HER CONSCIENCE WERE NOT YET AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER THEY PARTED AT THE DOOR FROM THE GARDEN AND SHE RETURNED TO THE SICK ROOM SHE PAUSED HESITATING TO ENTER ALL WAS STILL AS THE GRAVE SHE TURNED THE HANDLE SOFTLY AND PEEPED IN
8465-246947-0012_2136-5140-0010 COULD IT BE THAT WINGFOLD'S BEARING HAD COMMUNICATED TO HER MIND A SHADOW OF THE AWE WITH WHICH HE HAD LEFT THE PLACE WHERE PERHAPS A SOUL WAS BEING BORN AGAIN LEOPOLD DID NOT MOVE TERROR LAID HOLD OF HER HEART
8465-246947-0014_7078-271888-0084 WAS IT RUDIMENTARY THANKFULNESS TO THE FATHER OF HER SPIRIT AS SHE STOOD GAZING WITH THE LOOK OF A MOTHER OVER HER SICK CHILD HE LIFTED HIS EYELIDS AND SMILED A SAD SMILE WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE ROOM HE SAID A MINUTE AGO SHE ANSWERED
8465-246947-0015_2518-154825-0039 I DID NOT HEAR YOU HE RETURNED NO YOU WERE ASLEEP NOT I MISTER WINGFOLD IS ONLY JUST GONE I HAVE LET HIM OUT ON THE MEADOW SINCE LEOPOLD STARED LOOKED HALF ALARMED AND THEN SAID
8465-246947-0016_6272-70191-0029 DID GOD MAKE ME SLEEP HELEN SHE DID NOT ANSWER THE LIGHT OF A NEW HOPE IN HIS EYE AS IF THE DAWN HAD BEGUN AT LAST TO BREAK OVER THE DARK MOUNTAINS WAS ALREADY REFLECTED FROM HER HEART OH HELEN HE SAID
8465-246947-0018_587-54108-0055 HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
8465-246947-0021_125-121342-0036 GOOD AND KIND AND STRONG AS HE IS EVEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET YOU HELEN BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN DO WITHOUT MISTER WINGFOLD ANY MORE I FANCY I WISH YOU LIKED HIM BETTER
8465-246947-0023_1926-147979-0030 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM THOUGH YOU NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED LEOPOLD BUT THEN HE CAME TO ME WITH HIS DOOR OPEN AND LET ME WALK IN
8465-246947-0024_78-369-0024 HE HASN'T GOT A SECRET LIKE US HELEN HE ADDED SADLY WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU MUCH WHAT HE SAID TO YOU FROM THE PULPIT THE OTHER DAY I SHOULD THINK THEN SHE WAS RIGHT FOR ALL HIS HARDNESS AND WANT OF SYMPATHY THE CURATE HAD YET HAD REGARD TO HER ENTREATIES
8465-246947-0025_328-129766-0079 AND WAS NOT GOING TO PUT ANY HORRID NOTIONS ABOUT DUTY AND SELF SACRIFICE INTO THE POOR BOY'S HEAD HE'S COMING AGAIN TO MORROW ADDED LEOPOLD ALMOST GLEEFULLY AND THEN PERHAPS HE WILL TELL ME MORE AND HELP ME ON A BIT DID HE TELL YOU HE WANTS TO BRING A FRIEND WITH HIM
8465-246947-0027_3807-4955-0019 AND ANOTHER COMES DIVING AFTER HIM IT ISN'T FOR ME TO SAY HOW HE IS TO TAKE HOLD OF ME NO HELEN WHEN I TRUST I TRUST OUT AND OUT HELEN SIGHED THINKING HOW ILL THAT HAD WORKED WITH EMMELINE
8468-286673-0000_1447-130550-0007 THE SLOW LITTLE MUD TURTLE WHEN THE TWENTY LITTLE MUD TURTLES BROKE THEIR EGG SHELLS ONE HOT SUMMER DAY AND POKED THEIR WAY UP THROUGH THE WARM SAND IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THEY LOOKED ALMOST AS MUCH ALIKE AS SO MANY RAINDROPS
8468-286673-0001_669-129074-0013 THE MOTHER TURTLE WHO WAS SUNNING HERSELF ON THE BANK NEAR BY SAID TO HER FRIENDS WHY THERE ARE MY CHILDREN DID YOU EVER SEE A FINER FAMILY I BELIEVE I WILL GO OVER AND SPEAK TO THEM
8468-286673-0002_5778-12761-0040 AND THEN SAT DOWN UNTIL IT SHOULD STOP ACHING WAIT FOR ME HE CALLED OUT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I'M COMING IN A MINUTE THE OTHER LITTLE TURTLES WAITED BUT WHEN HIS TOE WAS COMFORTABLE AGAIN AND HE STARTED TOWARD THEM HE MET A VERY INTERESTING SNAIL
8468-286673-0003_1963-142393-0034 AND TALKED A WHILE WITH HIM COME ON SAID THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE DON'T LET'S WAIT ANY LONGER HE CAN CATCH UP SO THEY SPRAWLED ALONG UNTIL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SIT IN A ROW ON AN OLD LOG AND THEY CLIMBED ONTO IT AND SAT JUST CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER
8468-286673-0004_2911-7601-0010 AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
8468-286673-0005_6880-216547-0059 YOU CERTAINLY ARE FOR I SAW YOU SCRAMBLING OUT OF THE SAND A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND YOU CAME FROM THE VERY PLACE WHERE I LAID MY EGGS AND COVERED THEM DURING THE FIRST REALLY WARM NIGHTS THIS YEAR I WAS TELLING YOUR FATHER ONLY YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR YOU TO HATCH
8468-286673-0007_7302-86815-0077 WHY ARE YOU NOT UP HERE WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE ASKED SUDDENLY OF THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WHO WAS TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR HIMSELF ON THE LOG THEY DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME HE SAID I WAS COMING RIGHT ALONG BUT THEY WOULDN'T WAIT I THINK THEY ARE JUST AS MEA
8468-286673-0009_3436-172171-0033 I THOUGHT YOU WERE WHEN I HEARD YOU TRYING TO MAKE THE OTHERS WAIT IT IS TOO BAD
8468-286673-0010_8226-274371-0002 YET DOWN IN HIS LITTLE TURTLE HEART HE THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH IT HE WAS SURE HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SCOLD THE OTHER TURTLE CHILDREN FOR LEAVING HIM HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO SO HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE AT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THAT SIDE
8468-286673-0015_7859-102518-0004 AND YOU SHE ADDED TURNING TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS MUST BE PATIENT WITH HIM WE SHALL NOT HAVE HIM WITH US LONG
8468-286673-0019_6836-61803-0009 AND THESE COUSINS OF THE TURTLES LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THEM THAT SOME PEOPLE CANNOT TELL THEM APART THAT IS BECAUSE THEY FORGET THAT THE TORTOISES LIVE ON LAND HAVE HIGHER BACK SHELLS AND MOVE VERY VERY SLOWLY TURTLES LIVE MORE IN THE WATER
8468-286673-0021_1594-135914-0067 THEIR MOTHER WAS WITH SOME OF HER FRIENDS ON ANOTHER LOG NEAR BY SHE LOOKED OFTEN AT HER CHILDREN AND THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME THEIR ROUNDED UP BACK SHELLS WERE IN THE SUNSHINE WITH THE LITTLE RED AND YELLOW MARKINGS SHOWING ON THE BLACK
8468-286673-0025_118-124588-0020 AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0027_5322-7679-0007 NEXT THE OTHER GREAT ANIMAL TOOK HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AND RAPPED ON HIS SHELLS AND STARED AT HIM
8468-286673-0029_6529-62556-0005 HE LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY THEN THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED HIM UP AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING SHARP AND SHINY AND CUT MARKS INTO HIS UPPER SHELL
8468-286673-0031_1502-122619-0051 THEN HE WAS VERY VERY TIRED BUT HE WANTED SO MUCH TO GET BACK TO HIS HOME IN THE POND THAT HE STARTED AT ONCE BY MOONLIGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER SEEN THE MOON FOR EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE LAYING EGGS TURTLES USUALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT
8468-286673-0035_445-123857-0020 BUT CUDDLED INSIDE HIS TWO SHELLS AND WENT TO SLEEP ALSO HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS EYES HIS RELATIVES WERE SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT HIM AND HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE SLEPT
8468-286673-0037_4214-7146-0044 IF YOU WILL ONLY LEARN TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE SAID I SHALL NOT BE SORRY THAT THE BOYS CARRIED YOU OFF YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE SAID THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE AND HE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AFTER THAT
8468-286673-0038_6064-56165-0015 HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SLIP FROM THE LOG TO THE WATER IF ANYTHING SCARED THEM AND WHEN ONE DAY A STRANGE TURTLE FROM ANOTHER POND CAME TO VISIT HE SAID TO THE TURTLES WHO HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
8468-286673-0040_298-126791-0008 AND BY MISTAKE CALLED HIM THE QUICK SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-294887-0000_6531-61334-0112 AND WITH A FEW OTHERS DEVOTED THE MOST OF THE SABBATH TO THEIR TEACHING WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER ARTHUR ASSEMBLED THE SEVENTY ANTI SLAVERY AGENTS WHO WERE THEREAFTER LIKE FIREBRANDS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE LAND THEY HELD THEIR MEETINGS IN THIS ROOM

8609-262281-0032_7302-86815-0061 REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE

8609-262281-0037_6081-42010-0012 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
8609-262281-0038_1263-138246-0015 ARTHUR DID NOT FEEL HOPEFUL INDEED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING HAMISH AND HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE THE DARK SHADOW THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL THIS TO MISTER YORKE WERE MISTER CHANNING TO GO ABROAD AND THE ARREST OF HAMISH TO FOLLOW UPON IT
8609-262281-0039_7148-7763-0030 DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
8609-262281-0043_6181-216552-0067 I INTEND TO BE A CHIEF CONTRIBUTOR TO IT MYSELF BUT HIS JOKING WORDS AND CARELESS MANNER JARRED AT THAT MOMENT UPON THE SPIRIT BOTH OF ARTHUR AND CONSTANCE CHANNING WHY
8609-283227-0002_5750-100289-0030 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0003_4397-15666-0000 CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
8609-283227-0006_6147-34607-0028 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0007_4297-13009-0035 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0010_730-358-0045 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0012_3723-171631-0038 AND ANY READER WHO SAYS SO WILL SAY RIGHT ALL I HAVE TO SUGGEST FOR MYSELF IS SIMPLY A CERTAIN SHYNESS FOR WHICH I CANNOT ENTIRELY ACCOUNT BUT WHICH WAS PARTLY MADE UP OF FEAR TO INTRUDE OR OF BEING SUPPOSED TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE RIGHT OF MAKING ADVANCES
8609-283227-0013_8747-293952-0021 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014_2136-5140-0033 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0019_201-127786-0008 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0023_2518-154826-0045 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0026_8468-286673-0017 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0027_7517-100429-0005 AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
8609-283227-0029_5456-62043-0006 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0030_5322-7678-0017 GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
8609-283227-0031_6454-107462-0012 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0034_26-495-0085 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035_8324-286683-0004 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0037_839-130898-0071 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0040_4014-186179-0011 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0042_1183-133255-0000 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0044_5104-33406-0049 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0045_7178-34644-0068 OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
8609-283227-0046_1578-140049-0001 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0051_7078-271888-0006 I WILL YIELD THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SAME GROUND FOR BELIEVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL CHURCH APPOINTED SUCH BY GOD THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AND YOU KNOW ALREADY FOR RECEIVING THE JEWISH CHURCH AS THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD
8609-283227-0052_8797-294123-0018 THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
8609-283227-0053_3807-4923-0014 HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
8609-283227-0054_2159-179156-0012 AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
8609-283227-0055_1578-6379-0030 A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
8609-283227-0056_5514-19193-0031 AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
8609-283227-0063_7278-104730-0042 I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
8609-283227-0066_1841-179183-0023 AND MANY A TIME ERE HIS DEATH WE CONSULTED TOGETHER ABOUT THINGS THAT BEFELL ONCE HE CAME TO ME ABOUT A LEGAL DIFFICULTY IN CONNEXION WITH THE DEED OF TRUST OF HIS CHAPEL AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP HIM MYSELF I DIRECTED HIM TO SUCH HELP AS WAS THOROUGH
8609-283227-0067_1992-141719-0036 AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
8609-283227-0068_1447-130550-0015 THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
8609-283227-0069_7367-86737-0103 I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
8609-283227-0070_322-124147-0007 IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
8629-261139-0001_7800-283478-0019 IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
8629-261139-0002_5808-48608-0052 HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
8629-261139-0003_8014-112602-0002 BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
8629-261139-0006_1081-125237-0056 SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
8629-261139-0010_4195-17507-0024 AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
8629-261139-0011_6019-3185-0066 HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
8629-261139-0012_5561-41615-0010 WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
8629-261139-0013_4051-11218-0014 HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
8629-261139-0014_3374-298025-0010 BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
8629-261139-0015_4018-107312-0013 WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
8629-261139-0016_5104-33406-0046 AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
8629-261139-0018_118-47824-0080 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
8629-261139-0024_6181-216552-0020 WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
8629-261139-0026_2136-5143-0039 IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
8629-261139-0027_1183-133256-0010 NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
8629-261139-0028_445-123857-0031 DID FREDERICK MOVE FORWARD THE MOMENT WAS INTENSE THE CORONER SEEMED TO SHARE THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
8629-261139-0029_1447-130551-0012 THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
8629-261139-0030_254-127705-0038 INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
8629-261139-0032_1235-135887-0028 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
8629-261139-0039_26-496-0012 GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
8629-261139-0043_2691-156750-0030 I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
8629-261139-0044_19-198-0023 WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
8629-261139-0048_5049-25947-0073 I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
8629-261139-0050_4160-14187-0028 WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
8629-261139-0051_6531-61334-0073 AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
8629-261139-0056_39-121916-0020 I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
8629-261139-0059_201-127786-0040 OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
8629-261139-0061_887-123290-0028 NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
8629-261139-0064_7794-295947-0038 IF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFE
8629-261139-0065_7067-76047-0037 DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
8629-261139-0066_3982-178459-0059 GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
8629-261139-0068_5652-39938-0057 MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
8629-261139-0069_8051-119902-0012 AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
8629-261139-0070_3830-12531-0031 SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
8629-261139-0071_4406-16882-0035 WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
8629-261140-0002_831-130739-0053 YOU HAVE HEARD HIM CALL ME SON WITH WHAT WORDS SHALL I OVERTHROW HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH AND RECTITUDE OF HIS LONG BURIED WIFE AND MAKE HIM KNOW IN HIS OLD AGE THAT HE HAS WASTED YEARS OF PATIENCE UPON ONE WHO WAS NOT OF HIS BLOOD
8629-261140-0008_248-130652-0011 AND WHEN I SAW BY HER CLEARING BROW AND PEACEFUL LOOK THAT I HAD FULLY PERSUADED HER OF THIS I LET HER SPEAK WHAT WORDS SHE WOULD AND TELL AS SHE WAS ABLE
8629-261140-0012_2436-2481-0003 SHE DID NOT REGRET HER FATAL ACT VIOLENT AND UNCALLED FOR AS IT WAS FOR IT HAD SHOWED HER MY HEART AND ALLOWED ME TO READ HERS
8629-261140-0013_4788-294466-0020 AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
8629-261140-0019_8425-287387-0027 FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
8629-261140-0021_2159-179156-0035 AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
8629-261140-0023_374-180299-0006 WHEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN QUARTER A SINGLE CUTTING VOICE AROSE IN THIS ONE SHORT MOCKING COMMENT OH THE FAIRY TALE WAS IT AMABEL WHO SPOKE SOME THOUGHT SO AND LOOKED HER WAY
8629-261140-0024_458-126290-0012 AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
8629-261140-0026_3723-171115-0034 BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
8629-261140-0028_1235-135884-0021 AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
8629-261140-0032_8425-292520-0029 AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
8629-261140-0033_254-127705-0029 IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF PLACED BUT THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND PAST INGRATITUDES TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHOCK WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECEIVE ON LEARNING AT THIS LATE DAY
8629-261140-0036_1455-134435-0063 STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
8629-261140-0037_1088-129236-0026 AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
8629-261140-0038_5456-58161-0014 FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
8629-261140-0043_5561-41615-0048 SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
8629-261140-0044_2436-2477-0030 WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
8629-261140-0046_5678-43301-0003 NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
8630-305212-0004_4160-11550-0020 BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
8630-305212-0005_289-121652-0004 BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD THEY DID NOT CARE TO EAT THEM AND THREW THEM TO THE PIGS IT WAS NOT SCHOOLBOY GREED THAT PROMPTED THE THEFT BUT THE PURE DELIGHT OF DOING EVIL
8630-305212-0007_4340-15220-0021 KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0008_2989-138035-0050 THE OLD PAGAN WAYS SEEMED ONLY NATURAL HE WAS SCARCELY LIKELY TO BE ASTONISHED AT THE FACT THAT HIS SON'S BOYHOOD WAS RATHER LIKE WHAT HIS OWN HAD BEEN HE WAS STANDING IT IS TRUE ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHURCH
8630-305212-0010_6476-57446-0006 THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
8630-305212-0011_200-124140-0035 AND MARVELLED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GRACE OF BAPTISM WAS THAT INDEED HIS MOTHER HE ASKED HIMSELF THAT GENTLE PATIENT OLD WOMAN SO THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS SO READY TO GIVE UP HER OWN WILL
8630-305212-0013_7148-82991-0003 SEEMED TO BE CATCHING SHE WAS LIKE THE SUNSHINE PENETRATING EVERYWHERE WITH ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH HE ALAS WAS FAR BEHIND HIS MOTHER CATECHUMEN THOUGH HE WAS THE OLD TEMPER WOULD OFTEN FLASH OUT STILL
8630-305212-0015_8095-274346-0024 THAT WITH GOD'S HELP THE HARDEST THINGS WERE POSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD KNEEL AND PRAY TOGETHER AND PATRICIUS WOULD TAKE HEART AGAIN FOR THE FIGHT SHE HAD A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE PATRICIUS HAD NOTICED THAT BEFORE
8630-305212-0016_1447-130551-0028 HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0017_2384-152900-0033 GOD DID NOT MIND THEM AND THAT WAS A VERY COMFORTING REFLECTION FOR POOR WEAK PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF TO GO ON TRYING WAS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR HIM ALTHOUGH HE KNEW HE COULD NOT ALWAYS PROMISE HIMSELF SUCCESS
8630-305212-0021_839-130898-0005 SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
8630-305212-0022_2911-7601-0048 TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
8630-305212-0024_426-122822-0016 IF IT WAS SECOND ONLY TO ROME FOR ITS CULTURE AND ITS SCHOOLS IT ALMOST RIVALLED ROME IN ITS CORRUPTION THERE ALL THAT WAS WORST IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST MET AND MINGLED

8630-305213-0015_5192-19396-0009 WHO HAD KNOWN LITTLE SYMPATHY OR TENDERNESS IN THEIR HARD LIVES IT WAS A REVELATION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH TAUGHT THEM MORE THAN HOURS OF PREACHING COULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WAS OTHER WORK BESIDES THAT AT THE HOSPITAL
8630-305213-0018_226-131532-0015 IF I TEACH THEM TO KNOW AND LOVE HIM AS A FATHER HE WILL WATCH OVER MY SON IT WAS A CUSTOM OF THE TIME ON THE FEASTS OF SAINTS AND MARTYRS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THEIR TOMBS
8630-305213-0019_6415-116629-0028 WITH A LITTLE BASKET OF FOOD AND WINE THIS WAS LAID ON THE GRAVE AFTER WHICH THE FAITHFUL WOULD PARTAKE OF WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WHILE THEY THOUGHT AND SPOKE OF THE NOBLE LIVES OF GOD'S SERVANTS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE

8770-295463-0000_2289-152258-0031 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE GLORY OF GETTYSBURG THE BATTLE
8770-295463-0001_2182-181173-0004 IF LEE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS THERE HE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK BY SUCH A BRILLIANT STROKE HE COULD HAVE SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE GRAND RESULT OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0002_2518-154826-0039 IN POINT OF NUMBERS BRAVERY AND GENIUS THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WAS THE GREATEST THAT HAD EVER BEEN FOUGHT UP TO THAT TIME GLORIOUS AS THIS WAS
8770-295463-0004_322-124146-0026 ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
8770-295463-0005_458-126294-0000 BUT HE SOON WON THE GREAT BATTLES OF FREDERICKSBURG AND CHANCELLORSVILLE AND HAD MADE HIS WAY NORTH INTO PENNSYLVANIA THE NIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE
8770-295463-0012_1447-130550-0030 THAT IF HE WOULD STAND BY OUR BOYS AT GETTYSBURG I WOULD STAND BY HIM AND HE DID AND I WILL THE PRESIDENT'S CALL ON GENERAL SICKLES WAS ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THE THREE DAYS BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG

8770-295463-0014_4898-28461-0018 HAD BEEN SO GENERALLY CUT ON ALL SIDES OF VICKSBURG THAT THE NEWS WAS SENT TO CAIRO AND TELEGRAPHED TO WASHINGTON IN PROOF THAT HIS FAITH EVEN INCLUDED THE MISSISSIPPI BLOCKADE HE WENT ON BESIDES
8770-295463-0015_226-122538-0011 I HAVE BEEN PRAYING OVER VICKSBURG ALSO AND BELIEVE OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS GOING TO GIVE US VICTORY THERE TOO BECAUSE WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO BISECT THE CONFEDERACY
8770-295463-0017_6367-65536-0005 BUT MISTER EVERETT WAS TO BE THE CHIEF SPEAKER OF THE OCCASION THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE DATE OF THE DEDICATION THE PRESIDENT WENT WITH HIS FRIEND NOAH BROOKS
8770-295463-0021_8465-246942-0027 DON'T HURRY BOYS THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING GOING ON TILL I GET THERE WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED ON THE WAY TO GETTYSBURG A LITTLE GIRL ON THE PLATFORM HELD UP A BOUQUET TO MISTER LINCOLN LISPING FLOWERTH FOR THE PRETHIDENT
8770-295463-0024_19-198-0028 THERE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING
8770-295463-0026_6000-55211-0038 THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING WAS SUFFICIENT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE APPLAUDED ABRAHAM LINCOLN IF HE HAD MERELY RECITED THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
8770-295463-0027_403-128339-0005 WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ATTEND TAKING SECRETARY SEWARD WITH HIM HE CALLED ON AN OLD COBBLER NAMED JOHN BURNS OF WHOSE COURAGE IN THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG MISTER LINCOLN HAD JUST HEARD
8770-295465-0000_8063-274116-0005 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN PATRIOT THERE WAS NO MORE STURDY LITTLE PATRIOT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAN LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN THE CHILD OF THE NATION
8770-295465-0001_2007-149877-0033 NOR HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A MORE DEVOTED ADMIRER AND FOLLOWER THAN HIS OWN SMALL SON A WORD FROM HIS FATHER WOULD MELT THE LAD TO TEARS AND SUBMISSION OR BRING HIM OUT OF A NERVOUS TANTRUM WITH HIS
8770-295465-0004_4481-17498-0003 MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
8770-295465-0006_6147-34607-0017 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0007_2952-410-0003 BUT THAT HIS HEART WENT OUT ALSO TO THE BOYS IN GRAY THE SOLDIERS WERE ALL BOYS TO HIM THEY KNEW HE LOVED THEM THEY SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE CARES FOR US HE TAKES OUR PART
8770-295465-0008_3699-47246-0026 WE WILL FIGHT FOR HIM YES WE WILL DIE FOR HIM AND A LARGE PART OF THE COMMON SOLDIER'S PATRIOTISM WAS THIS HEART RESPONSE OF THE BOYS TO THE GREAT BOY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295465-0009_27-124992-0060 FOR THE YOUNGER SOLDIERS THE REAL BOYS OF THE ARMY GOING ALWAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIS PAPA DAY SAY OF SEVERAL YOUTHS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT FOR SLEEPING AT THEIR POST OR SOME LIKE OFFENSE
8770-295465-0010_458-126305-0028 THAT BOY IS WORTH MORE ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER OR A LIVE BOY CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER THAN A DEAD ONE GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S MOTTO
8770-295465-0011_163-122947-0042 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0013_4441-76250-0036 IN THE BACKWOODS AS WELL AS IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND THE BOYS IN GRAY WERE HIS BOYS TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO THEY HAD WANDERED AWAY THEY WERE A LITTLE WAYWARD BUT HE WOULD WIN THEM BACK
8770-295465-0014_78-369-0062 THE GREAT CHIVALROUS SOUTH HAS LEARNED SINCE THOSE BITTER RUINOUS DAYS THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE SOUTH THEN HAD IN THE NORTH TAD HAD SEEN HIS FATHER SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS TO ALL THE BOYS
8770-295465-0016_4813-248641-0053 AND THE COUNTRY ANY GOOD BUT IT HURT HIM DEEP IN HIS HEART TO KNOW THAT SOME OF HIS BELOVED CHILDREN MISUNDERSTOOD HIM SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL HIM IT WAS NO ONE'S BULLET WHICH MADE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MARTYR
8770-295465-0018_2436-2481-0021 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0020_2836-5354-0003 TO HOLD THE CANDLE BY WHICH MISTER LINCOLN WAS TO READ HIS SPEECH LITTLE TAD WAS WITH HIS FATHER AS USUAL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAD FINISHED READING A PAGE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT HE LET IT FLUTTER DOWN LIKE A LEAF OR A BIG WHITE BUTTERFLY
8770-295465-0021_7059-88364-0001 FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY

8770-295465-0026_2817-142380-0024 WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
8770-295465-0027_1183-128659-0003 AS MISTER LINCOLN CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR AFTER SPEAKING TO THE CROWD MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD BEEN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS LOOKING ON FROM WITHIN EXCLAIMED TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE SO CARELESS
8770-295465-0029_5463-39173-0054 BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
8770-295465-0030_163-122947-0017 AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM

8770-295465-0039_3526-175658-0004 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8797-294123-0001_4397-15668-0002 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0002_7517-100437-0012 WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS

8797-294123-0029_7780-274562-0092 LIBERTY TO HIM EPITOMIZES ITSELF IN ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF TOIL TO TILL THE SOIL AND LABOUR INTERMINABLY WITH RUDE IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS IS ALL HE ASKS OF LIFE AND OF THE POWERS THAT BE
8797-294123-0030_1970-26100-0008 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0033_32-4137-0051 HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
8797-294123-0034_3807-4923-0017 STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
8797-294123-0035_5390-30102-0000 HE DOES NOT HIDE AWAY HIS CHICKENS AND HIS EGGS NOR ANY OTHER COMMODITY HE POSSESSES HE PROCEEDS AT ONCE TO OFFER THEM FOR SALE NOR IS HE TO BE BULLIED INTO LOWERING HIS PRICE
8797-294123-0036_669-129074-0003 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0038_8419-286667-0020 NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
8797-294123-0040_4406-16883-0008 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0041_1553-140047-0034 ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
8797-294123-0043_196-122159-0010 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0045_7264-92316-0017 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0047_6000-55211-0021 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0048_103-1241-0017 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049_403-216-0015 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0051_412-126975-0073 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0053_8051-295385-0020 DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
8797-294123-0057_6880-216547-0084 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0060_6925-80680-0081 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061_831-130746-0006 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0062_233-155990-0031 THE CHINESE IS NOT DEAD TO NEW IDEAS HE IS AN EFFICIENT WORKER MAKES A GOOD SOLDIER AND IS WEALTHY IN THE ESSENTIAL MATERIALS OF A MACHINE AGE UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT HE WILL GO FAR
8797-294123-0063_163-122947-0051 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064_3235-28433-0008 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0065_5339-14134-0027 HE THINKS WITH THE SAME THOUGHT SYMBOLS AS DOES THE CHINESE AND HE THINKS IN THE SAME PECULIAR GROOVES HE GOES ON WHERE WE ARE BALKED BY THE OBSTACLES OF INCOMPREHENSION HE TAKES THE TURNING WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
8797-294123-0067_1088-134315-0007 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0069_3240-131232-0018 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070_5808-48608-0003 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0071_6181-216552-0018 THE POSSIBILITY OF RACE ADVENTURE HAS NOT PASSED AWAY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN THE SLAV IS JUST GIRDING HIMSELF UP TO BEGIN WHY MAY NOT THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN START OUT ON AN ADVENTURE AS TREMENDOUS AS OUR OWN AND MORE STRIKINGLY UNIQUE
8797-294123-0072_1502-122619-0006 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0075_3807-4923-0030 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0078_4297-13006-0004 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0083_6078-54007-0022 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0085_481-123719-0036 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0087_7505-83618-0014 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0089_426-122821-0032 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN
8797-294123-0090_19-198-0010 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091_5393-19218-0005 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0092_3168-173565-0030 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8797-294123-0094_3607-29116-0028 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0095_8123-275209-0028 A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
8797-294123-0096_2159-179156-0026 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0098_7278-246956-0032 BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
8797-294123-0099_1334-135589-0091 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0101_8088-284756-0112 BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
8797-294123-0103_1502-122615-0023 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
8838-298545-0003_6848-252322-0022 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST

8838-298545-0016_403-128339-0015 LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER

8838-298545-0020_1898-145715-0022 LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST

8838-298545-0024_7190-90542-0077 YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
8838-298545-0025_3947-13260-0045 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0028_103-1240-0008 NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT

8838-298545-0044_3235-11599-0005 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0045_3436-172162-0025 ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
8838-298545-0046_6181-216552-0068 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH

8838-298546-0000_6818-76332-0055 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001_1098-133695-0017 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002_5463-39174-0031 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0006_7402-90848-0060 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007_441-128988-0008 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008_4088-158077-0091 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0010_27-123349-0022 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS

8838-298546-0021_6848-76049-0017 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0023_5322-7679-0014 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024_3807-4923-0058 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025_7794-295947-0009 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO

8838-298546-0030_8609-283227-0047 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0033_2136-5140-0032 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM

887-123289-0012_8014-280382-0012 I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
887-123289-0015_5703-47198-0005 ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
887-123289-0016_196-122152-0010 AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
887-123289-0019_4859-22176-0008 SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
887-123289-0020_3112-9554-0021 THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
887-123289-0021_8051-295385-0028 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0023_1116-137572-0015 I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
887-123289-0026_3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
887-123289-0028_8108-274318-0034 YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION
887-123289-0030_2092-145706-0060 LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
887-123289-0032_4788-294466-0003 THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
887-123289-0033_8095-274346-0045 PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
887-123289-0034_2911-7601-0038 WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
887-123289-0037_5808-54425-0042 AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
887-123289-0038_625-132112-0037 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123290-0001_19-227-0020 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002_78-369-0017 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0003_211-122425-0009 JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
887-123290-0004_89-219-0027 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0006_730-358-0058 TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
887-123290-0007_8088-284756-0101 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008_150-126107-0009 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0010_3879-174923-0026 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011_289-121665-0034 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0012_302-123504-0009 I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
887-123290-0015_1502-122619-0034 I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
887-123290-0017_730-358-0006 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0018_7302-86814-0017 THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
887-123290-0022_6836-61804-0002 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0024_2159-179154-0011 HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
887-123290-0025_87-121553-0012 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0027_5678-43302-0014 HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
887-123291-0002_8465-246943-0022 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0004_8630-305213-0048 SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
887-123291-0005_3830-12531-0029 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006_8468-294887-0023 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0008_4297-13009-0025 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0010_3259-158083-0125 BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
887-123291-0011_3723-171115-0030 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012_1088-129236-0001 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0013_4788-294466-0015 TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
887-123291-0014_7517-100437-0000 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015_8838-298545-0035 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0017_8095-274345-0023 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018_8468-295198-0002 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0019_4640-19187-0009 EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
887-123291-0023_1069-133709-0012 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024_696-92939-0006 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0027_7148-7763-0022 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0029_6000-55211-0041 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0035_3982-182255-0008 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036_3723-171631-0030 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0038_8609-283227-0015 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039_5703-47198-0021 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0040_2136-5147-0001 THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
887-123291-0041_1963-147036-0016 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
89-218-0000_446-123501-0035 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
89-218-0005_911-128684-0059 PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
89-218-0006_2952-408-0009 IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
89-218-0011_3436-172171-0002 AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
89-218-0012_8051-118101-0028 SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
89-218-0013_4267-287369-0028 AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
89-218-0015_7635-105409-0029 SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
89-218-0016_1578-140045-0002 CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
89-218-0018_405-130895-0035 AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
89-218-0019_1624-142933-0011 WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
89-218-0020_226-131532-0023 TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
89-218-0021_4340-15220-0005 AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
89-218-0022_4267-72637-0034 ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
89-218-0024_1081-128618-0005 THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
89-218-0028_8123-275193-0009 YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
89-218-0030_412-126975-0087 HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
89-218-0032_5750-100289-0042 AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
89-218-0033_1183-133256-0017 I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
89-218-0035_7517-100437-0004 AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
89-218-0036_8312-279790-0006 SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
89-218-0039_6272-70191-0006 BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
89-218-0041_6848-252322-0016 THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0043_2952-410-0057 AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
89-218-0044_426-122822-0030 AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
89-218-0046_307-127535-0002 HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
89-218-0048_4680-16041-0025 HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
89-218-0050_6437-66172-0027 AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
89-218-0055_2514-149482-0078 SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-218-0057_2159-179157-0016 AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
89-219-0000_8975-270782-0013 INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0002_2691-156745-0039 AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0004_7059-77900-0023 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0005_1578-6379-0046 TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
89-219-0009_3242-67153-0006 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0014_7302-86814-0038 THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0015_696-93314-0033 WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0020_887-123291-0025 I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
89-219-0021_1355-39947-0024 THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022_6437-66173-0000 DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0026_1447-130550-0018 AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
89-219-0028_2518-154826-0027 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0029_1898-145715-0013 HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
89-219-0031_8088-284756-0055 NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0034_254-12312-0017 AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0036_2952-410-0027 AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0042_8123-275216-0011 BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0047_302-123523-0017 IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
89-219-0048_4441-76250-0000 HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0051_3374-298032-0034 CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0054_2289-152258-0029 I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0057_2196-170379-0026 WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0059_39-121916-0027 SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
89-219-0060_7517-100437-0032 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0062_4088-158079-0015 SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
89-219-0063_3830-12531-0016 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
8975-270782-0004_887-123289-0025 THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
8975-270782-0005_7190-90542-0047 IN THIS CONNECTION IT APPEARS TO ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER LEARNED
8975-270782-0007_233-134440-0045 THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
8975-270782-0008_1088-134315-0027 AND MAKES REMARKS WHICH YEARS LATER ARE RETOLD TO IT BUT WHICH IT HAS ITSELF ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN BESIDES THE MEMORY IN THE EARLY YEARS IS MORE FACILE BECAUSE IT IS LESS BURDENED THAN IN LATER YEARS
8975-270782-0011_32-4137-0058 OUR MEMORY DEALS SELECTIVELY WITH ITS LATER MATERIALS WITH IMPRESSIONS WHICH COME TO US IN LATER LIFE IT RETAINS THE IMPORTANT AND DISCARDS THE UNIMPORTANT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE RETAINED CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
8975-270782-0014_2007-132570-0032 BY MEANS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS ONE IS ABLE TO DEVELOP OUT OF THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS FORGOTTEN
8975-270782-0015_89-219-0023 AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
8975-270782-0016_5789-57158-0002 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0019_8095-274346-0037 AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
8975-270782-0020_1040-133433-0071 IS THEN A FURTHER ARCHAIC TENDENCY OF THE DREAM THE SAME INFORMATION MAY BE MADE USE OF IN ANOTHER OF THE PUZZLES THAT HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO US YOU WILL RECALL HOW ASTONISHED PEOPLE WERE
8975-270782-0021_311-124404-0061 WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STIMULI WHICH GAVE RISE TO DREAMS WERE EXTREMELY BAD AND LICENTIOUS SEXUAL DESIRES WHICH HAVE MADE DREAM CENSORSHIP AND DREAM DISTORTION NECESSARY AFTER WE HAVE INTERPRETED SUCH A DREAM FOR THE DREAMER AND HE
8975-270782-0022_229-130880-0088 IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
8975-270782-0023_7447-91187-0015 WE NEED NOT HESITATE TO POINT OUT THIS ORIGIN THESE EVIL WISH IMPULSES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PAST OFTEN IN A PAST WHICH IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
8975-270782-0027_669-129061-0069 INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
8975-270782-0028_446-123502-0013 THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
8975-270782-0032_6880-216547-0020 AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
8975-270782-0033_5049-25947-0115 IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS OF DREAM STUDY BUT I MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF OUR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE RESTRAINT PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE TEMPORARY ABSTENTION LET US BE SATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF
8975-270782-0035_8630-305212-0043 WHICH MOST FREQUENTLY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE UNBOUNDED EGOISM OF THE DREAMER
8975-270782-0037_2518-154825-0042 WE HAVE WONDERED SUFFICIENTLY OVER THIS EVIL TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE AND CERTAINLY WERE NOT PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS RESULT OF DREAM INTERPRETATION WITHOUT QUESTION AFTER IT HAS ONCE BEEN SUGGESTED TO US TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WISHES IN THE PAST
8975-270782-0039_412-126975-0074 EVEN THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE CHILD SEEMS TO LOVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT LOVES AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE IT HAS NEED OF THEM CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM IN OTHERS WORDS OUT OF EGOISTICAL MOTIVES
8975-270782-0041_2196-170151-0016 FOR HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THAT WHICH HE HAS FOR HIS PARENTS
8975-270782-0043_8226-274371-0041 TO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN A NEW LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER ARRIVES THE LATTER IS USUALLY RECEIVED IN A FAR FROM FRIENDLY MANNER EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS I DON'T WANT HIM LET THE STORK TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN ARE VERY USUAL
8975-270782-0047_8797-294123-0032 WE NEED SELDOM FIND IT PUZZLING AND MAY TRACE ITS ORIGIN EASILY TO EARLY CHILDHOOD OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO TO THE PROPINQUITY OF LATER YEARS PROBABLY NO NURSERIES ARE FREE FROM MIGHTY CONFLICTS AMONG THE INHABITANTS
8975-270782-0049_8051-119902-0016 IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HATES A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY MORE THAN DOES HER MOTHER IT IS HER ELDER SISTER THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAYING HOWEVER THAT AROUSES OUR ANTIPATHY WE CAN AT A PINCH UNDERSTAND HATRED OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0051_1455-138263-0040 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0052_1334-135589-0051 WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
8975-270782-0053_1235-135884-0037 THE FEELINGS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR GROWN CHILDREN FAIL TO COME UP TO THE IDEAL ESTABLISHED BY SOCIETY HOW MUCH ENMITY EXISTS AND WOULD FIND EXPRESSION DID NOT ACCUMULATIONS OF PIETY AND OF TENDER IMPULSE HOLD THEM BACK THE MOTIVES FOR THIS ARE EVERYWHERE KNOWN
8975-270782-0055_2518-154825-0035 THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
8975-270782-0056_7226-86965-0036 TO THE SON THE FATHER IS THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERY SOCIAL RESTRICTION BORNE WITH SUCH GREAT OPPOSITION THE FATHER BARS THE WAY TO FREEDOM OF WILL TO EARLY SEXUAL SATISFACTION
8975-270782-0057_696-92939-0018 TO THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF IMPATIENT WAITING FOR THE DEATH OF THE FATHER GROWS TO HEIGHTS APPROXIMATING TRAGEDY IN THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE LESS STRAINED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER MOTHER AND SON
8975-270782-0058_1334-135589-0075 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0060_1098-133695-0013 RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
8975-270782-0061_2136-5143-0011 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0062_7226-86965-0005 AS IN THE CASE OF THE DREAMER'S SYMPATHY FOR HIS FATHER'S UNNECESSARY SUFFERINGS IN EXAMPLE THREE IT IS SELDOM THAT THE ENMITY ALONE CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH MORE OFTEN IT RECEDES BEHIND MORE TENDER IMPULSES
8975-270782-0066_1363-135842-0008 WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
8975-270782-0067_6818-76332-0004 IDEAS WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX BECAUSE THIS MYTH REALIZES WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY WEAKENED EFFECT THE TWO EXTREME WISHES WHICH GROW OUT OF THE SITUATION OF THE SON TO KILL HIS FATHER AND TAKE HIS MOTHER TO WIFE
8975-270782-0071_5456-58161-0028 AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
8975-270782-0073_8770-295462-0035 CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
8975-270782-0074_730-359-0020 WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MOTIVES IN UNENDING VARIATIONS DERIVATIONS AND DISGUISES ALSO IN DISTORTED FORMS SUCH AS WE RECOGNIZE TO BE THE WORK OF A CENSOR WE MAY ALSO ASCRIBE THIS OEDIPUS COMPLEX TO THOSE DREAMERS
8975-270782-0076_403-126855-0026 BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
8975-270782-0077_911-128684-0031 THUS WE ARE MOVED TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX LIFE IN THE CHILD ALSO AND WE DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS A MISTAKE TO DENY THAT THE CHILD HAS A SEXUAL LIFE AND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
8975-270782-0078_5104-33406-0007 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0079_2384-152900-0031 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0081_7511-102419-0013 HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
8975-270782-0086_7067-76047-0006 AND THEN AT THE WRITING TABLE DEFEND THE SEXUAL PURITY OF THE SAME CHILDREN WHERE CHILDREN ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES OR ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTION
8975-270782-0088_412-126975-0018 BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
8975-270782-0089_2893-139322-0002 WHEN WE REDISCOVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR DISTORTED DREAMS ALL THESE PERVERSE WISH IMPULSES IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE DREAM HAS IN THIS FIELD
8975-270782-0090_1963-142393-0013 THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
8975-270782-0091_2514-149482-0017 THE MOST MONSTROUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THIS FEAR OF INCEST SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT IS DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY FORESIGHT ON THE PART OF NATURE WHICH IS PSYCHICALLY REPRESENTED BY THIS PROHIBITION BECAUSE INBREEDING WOULD DETERIORATE THE RACE CHARACTER
8975-270782-0092_19-227-0063 OTHERS MAINTAINED THAT BECAUSE OF HAVING LIVED TOGETHER SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD THE SEXUAL DESIRE IS DIVERTED FROM THE PERSONS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN BOTH CASES FURTHERMORE THE INCEST AVOIDANCE WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ASSURED
8975-270782-0096_200-124140-0024 INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0099_5104-33406-0027 BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0101_6415-111615-0016 AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
8975-270782-0102_6880-216547-0081 AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
8975-270782-0103_103-1241-0026 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
8975-270782-0104_7517-100442-0021 BUT IT REAWAKENS THE PECULIARITIES OF OUR PRIMITIVE PSYCHIC LIFE THE ANCIENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE EGO THE EARLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SEXUAL LIFE EVEN OUR OLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
8975-270782-0107_8051-119902-0024 HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
8975-270782-0110_1502-122619-0056 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN WITHOUT HAVING SEARCHED THROUGH FURTHER PSYCHIC REALMS THE TIME WILL SOON COME HOWEVER WHEN WE SHALL CLOTHE THE UNCONSCIOUS CHARACTER OF THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHT WITH ANOTHER NAME
8975-270782-0111_26-495-0010 WHICH SHALL DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE INFANTILE WE MAY TO BE SURE PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT FORCES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP TO SUCH REGRESSION
8975-270782-0114_103-1240-0018 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
909-131041-0000_6437-66173-0038 THE MODE OF APPOINTMENT OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALMOST THE ONLY PART OF THE SYSTEM OF ANY CONSEQUENCE WHICH HAS ESCAPED WITHOUT SEVERE CENSURE OR WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF APPROBATION FROM ITS OPPONENTS
909-131041-0002_32-21631-0007 AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
909-131041-0003_226-131532-0029 BUT TO MEN CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE AND AT THE PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE IT WAS EQUALLY DESIRABLE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION SHOULD BE MADE BY MEN MOST CAPABLE OF ANALYZING THE QUALITIES ADAPTED TO THE STATION
909-131041-0004_5456-58161-0020 AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
909-131041-0006_322-124146-0037 BUT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO HAPPILY CONCERTED IN THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION PROMISE AN EFFECTUAL SECURITY AGAINST THIS MISCHIEF THE CHOICE OF SEVERAL TO FORM AN INTERMEDIATE BODY OF ELECTORS
909-131041-0011_3440-171009-0002 HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
909-131041-0013_2836-5354-0046 TO BE EXERTED IN THE CHOICE OF PERSONS FOR THE TEMPORARY AND SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY TO THIS TRUST ALL THOSE WHO FROM SITUATION MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF TOO GREAT DEVOTION TO THE PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
909-131041-0015_78-369-0037 WILL AT LEAST ENTER UPON THE TASK FREE FROM ANY SINISTER BIAS THEIR TRANSIENT EXISTENCE AND THEIR DETACHED SITUATION ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE OF AFFORD A SATISFACTORY PROSPECT OF THEIR CONTINUING SO TO THE CONCLUSION OF IT
909-131041-0016_8629-261140-0020 THE BUSINESS OF CORRUPTION WHEN IT IS TO EMBRACE SO CONSIDERABLE A NUMBER OF MEN REQUIRES TIME AS WELL AS MEANS NOR WOULD IT BE FOUND EASY SUDDENLY TO EMBARK THEM DISPERSED AS THEY WOULD BE OVER THIRTEEN STATES
909-131041-0017_1867-148436-0020 IN ANY COMBINATIONS FOUNDED UPON MOTIVES WHICH THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY BE DENOMINATED CORRUPT MIGHT YET BE OF A NATURE TO MISLEAD THEM FROM THEIR DUTY
909-131041-0019_1081-125237-0074 THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
909-131041-0020_8108-280354-0030 WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF EACH STATE SHALL CHOOSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AS ELECTORS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH STATE IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHO SHALL ASSEMBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND VOTE FOR SOME FIT PERSON AS PRESIDENT
909-131041-0021_3168-173565-0005 AND THE PERSON WHO MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE THE PRESIDENT BUT AS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES MIGHT NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO CENTRE IN ONE MAN AND AS IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE TO PERMIT LESS THAN A MAJORITY TO BE CONCLUSIVE
909-131041-0023_302-123516-0016 THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
909-131041-0024_5049-25947-0084 AND THE LITTLE ARTS OF POPULARITY MAY ALONE SUFFICE TO ELEVATE A MAN TO THE FIRST HONORS IN A SINGLE STATE BUT IT WILL REQUIRE OTHER TALENTS AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF MERIT TO ESTABLISH HIM IN THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE UNION
909-131041-0026_5463-39173-0028 PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
909-131041-0027_1235-135887-0003 THOUGH WE CANNOT ACQUIESCE IN THE POLITICAL HERESY OF THE POET WHO SAYS FOR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT LET FOOLS CONTEST THAT WHICH IS BEST ADMINISTERED IS BEST YET WE MAY SAFELY PRONOUNCE
909-131041-0030_1081-125237-0090 THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT AS THE VICE PRESIDENT MAY OCCASIONALLY BECOME A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN THE SUPREME EXECUTIVE MAGISTRACY ALL THE REASONS WHICH RECOMMEND THE MODE OF ELECTION PRESCRIBED FOR THE ONE
909-131044-0000_5789-70653-0021 THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET
909-131044-0001_3857-182315-0002 AND TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT THE LONGER THE DURATION IN OFFICE THE GREATER WILL BE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING SO IMPORTANT AN ADVANTAGE
909-131044-0002_3947-13260-0035 IT IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WILL BE INTERESTED IN WHATEVER HE POSSESSES IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS OR PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS IT
909-131044-0004_4014-186175-0000 THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
909-131044-0005_7113-86041-0069 FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
909-131044-0006_2007-132570-0001 IF THE CASE SHOULD ONLY BE THAT HE MIGHT LAY IT DOWN UNLESS CONTINUED BY A NEW CHOICE AND IF HE SHOULD BE DESIROUS OF BEING CONTINUED HIS WISHES CONSPIRING WITH HIS FEARS WOULD TEND STILL MORE POWERFULLY TO CORRUPT HIS INTEGRITY
909-131044-0007_6272-70171-0014 EITHER IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN THE LEGISLATURE AS ITS BEST RECOMMENDATION BUT SUCH MEN ENTERTAIN VERY CRUDE NOTIONS AS WELL OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS INSTITUTED AS OF THE TRUE MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC HAPPINESS MAY BE PROMOTED
909-131044-0012_1246-124548-0030 OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
909-131044-0014_78-369-0046 BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0021_4481-17499-0044 THEY ALWAYS ACT WITH SUCH MOMENTUM AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED HOW THE SHORTNESS OF THE DURATION IN OFFICE
909-131044-0022_1034-121119-0076 CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
909-131044-0025_460-172359-0092 WOULD NOT FOR THAT REASON BE PREFERABLE TO A LONGER PERIOD WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME TOO SHORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPIRING THE DESIRED FIRMNESS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS OR ANY OTHER LIMITED DURATION
909-131044-0028_298-126791-0056 OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN THE ESTEEM AND GOOD WILL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS HE MIGHT THEN HAZARD WITH SAFETY IN PROPORTION TO THE PROOFS HE HAD GIVEN OF HIS WISDOM AND INTEGRITY AND TO THE TITLE HE HAD ACQUIRED TO THE RESPECT AND ATTACHMENT OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
909-131044-0029_8063-274112-0004 AS ON THE ONE HAND A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO RENDER IT A VERY VALUABLE INGREDIENT IN THE COMPOSITION SO ON THE OTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ALARM FOR THE PUBLIC LIBERTY
909-131044-0033_3699-47246-0003 WHAT BUT THAT HE MIGHT BE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS HIM I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF HIS DURATION BE SUCH AS TO LEAVE A DOUBT OF HIS FIRMNESS THAT DOUBT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A JEALOUSY OF HIS ENCROACHMENTS
909-131045-0000_8095-274345-0032 THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS LARGEST SENSE COMPREHENDS ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC WHETHER LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIARY BUT IN ITS MOST USUAL AND PERHAPS ITS MOST PRECISE SIGNIFICATION
909-131045-0001_7226-86965-0038 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0002_6367-65536-0000 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0003_3807-4923-0042 THESE AND OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE NATURE CONSTITUTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOST PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT THE PERSONS THEREFORE TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT THESE DIFFERENT MATTERS ARE COMMITTED
909-131045-0004_7264-92310-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0006_200-126784-0017 THE PERSON SUBSTITUTED IS WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT THE DISMISSION OF HIS PREDECESSOR HAS PROCEEDED FROM A DISLIKE TO HIS MEASURES AND THAT THE LESS HE RESEMBLES HIM THE MORE HE WILL RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE FAVOR OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
909-131045-0007_1737-142397-0008 THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
909-131045-0008_3440-171009-0049 AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
909-131045-0013_2092-145706-0008 WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
909-131045-0018_4051-11218-0030 TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE ENJOYED WHILE IT LASTED AND MIGHT NOT SCRUPLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOST CORRUPT EXPEDIENTS TO MAKE THE HARVEST AS ABUNDANT AS IT WAS TRANSITORY THOUGH THE SAME MAN PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT PROSPECT BEFORE HIM
909-131045-0019_4014-186183-0021 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020_1235-135884-0009 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0023_6476-96661-0002 AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
909-131045-0029_7226-86964-0011 IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
909-131045-0030_2514-149482-0013 IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
909-131045-0031_5867-48852-0033 EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
909-131045-0033_4267-287369-0014 IT WOULD NECESSITATE A MUTABILITY OF MEASURES IT IS NOT GENERALLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT MEN WILL VARY AND MEASURES REMAIN UNIFORM THE CONTRARY IS THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS
909-131045-0036_1898-145715-0012 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
909-131045-0037_8609-283227-0065 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
909-131045-0038_6836-61804-0033 UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
909-131045-0039_198-126831-0022 ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
909-131045-0042_8465-246943-0005 THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
911-128684-0001_3440-171009-0055 OR CONCENTRATING ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF PASSION OR EMOTION CAN BE DIRECTLY FELT AS THE SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY WHICH IT IS AND KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH THE SPACE FILLING OBJECTIVE CONTENT WHICH IT ENVELOPES AND ACCOMPANIES
911-128684-0004_5390-30102-0027 CAN STAND ALTERNATELY FOR A FACT OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR FOR A PHYSICAL REALITY ACCORDING AS IT IS TAKEN IN ONE CONTEXT OR IN ANOTHER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
911-128684-0006_6147-34607-0025 A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
911-128684-0007_298-126791-0014 BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
911-128684-0008_3374-298032-0003 THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
911-128684-0009_1970-10594-0042 ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
911-128684-0011_2196-170151-0014 IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
911-128684-0014_5867-48852-0043 IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
911-128684-0017_229-130880-0092 IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
911-128684-0018_298-126791-0032 IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
911-128684-0020_103-1241-0025 BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
911-128684-0022_1263-141777-0026 THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
911-128684-0023_6019-3185-0045 CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
911-128684-0026_6209-34601-0025 THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
911-128684-0027_7190-90542-0064 WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
911-128684-0029_446-123501-0024 AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
911-128684-0030_6078-54013-0050 OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
911-128684-0034_4088-158077-0093 WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY
911-128684-0036_8609-283227-0041 WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
911-128684-0037_5867-48852-0070 ALL IN THEMSELVES AND QUITE APART FROM OUR OPINION WE EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO TALK OF A WEARY ROAD A GIDDY HEIGHT A JOCUND MORNING OR A SULLEN SKY
911-128684-0038_6880-216547-0054 AND THE TERM INDEFINITE WHILE USUALLY APPLIED ONLY TO OUR APPREHENSIONS FUNCTIONS AS A FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL QUALIFICATION OF THINGS IN SPENCER'S LAW OF EVOLUTION
911-128684-0043_5463-39174-0015 NOTICED AN ATTENDANT WALK ACROSS THE ROOM HE IDENTIFIED THE MOVEMENT WITH THAT OF HIS OWN HE DID NOT YET DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIS OWN MOVEMENTS AND THOSE OUTSIDE HIMSELF
911-128684-0044_6367-74004-0013 IN WHICH DISCRIMINATIONS AFTERWARDS NEEDFUL HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE A PIECE OF EXPERIENCE OF A DETERMINATE SORT IS THERE BUT THERE AT FIRST AS A PURE FACT
911-128684-0046_3830-12530-0032 AT THE MOMENT OF ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE LET THE READER ARREST HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF READING THIS ARTICLE NOW
911-128684-0047_7511-102419-0001 IS THERE AND WHETHER THERE FOR SOME ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS OR THERE FOR PHYSICAL NATURE IS A QUESTION NOT YET PUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS THERE FOR NEITHER LATER
911-128684-0049_426-122819-0010 OR AS RIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL FACTS SO THEY REMAIN EQUIVOCAL AND AS THE WORLD GOES THEIR EQUIVOCALITY IS ONE OF THEIR GREAT CONVENIENCES
911-128684-0050_328-129766-0082 ARE NOT COEFFICIENTS WITH WHICH EXPERIENCES COME TO US ABORIGINALLY STAMPED BUT ARE RATHER RESULTS OF A LATER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED BY US FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS
911-128684-0052_8088-284756-0033 THINGS ACT ON EACH OTHER AS WELL AS ON US BY MEANS OF THEIR SECONDARY QUALITIES SOUND AS SUCH GOES THROUGH THE AIR AND CAN BE INTERCEPTED
911-128684-0056_6147-34605-0013 HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
911-128684-0057_2817-142371-0028 ARE NOW TREATED AS ILLUSORY PROJECTIONS OUTWARDS OF PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES OR EFFECTS IN NATURE FOR THE MOST INTELLECTUAL CONTEMPORARY SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SPECULATION
911-128684-0058_6925-80680-0080 NATURE EXHIBITS ONLY CHANGES WHICH HABITUALLY COINCIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0062_481-123720-0055 TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0067_302-123523-0035 THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF OUR APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES HAS TO BE TREATED AS FALLING OUTSIDE OF IT IF WE MEAN BY PHYSICAL NATURE WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THE SURFACE OF OUR BODIES
911-128684-0069_4362-15663-0080 THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
911-128684-0072_7517-100437-0033 THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THUS NOT WHOLLY INERT PHYSICALLY THOUGH THEY BE ACTIVE ONLY IN THESE SMALL CORNERS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR BODIES OCCUPY
911-128684-0073_5688-41232-0002 THAT HOWEVER IS ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING CLASSED AS ABSOLUTELY NON OBJECTIVE THE ATTEMPT IF ANY ONE SHOULD MAKE IT TO SORT EXPERIENCES INTO TWO ABSOLUTELY DISCRETE GROUPS
911-128684-0074_7067-76047-0005 WITH NOTHING BUT INERTNESS IN ONE OF THEM AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER WOULD THUS RECEIVE ONE CHECK IT WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER AS SOON AS WE EXAMINED THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0077_2843-152918-0043 AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
911-128684-0079_6848-252322-0001 IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HOWEVER BE AN UNNATURAL STATUS IF THE POPULAR OPINION WHICH I CITED AT THE OUTSET WERE CORRECT IF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MEANT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTRINSIC NATURE
911-128684-0080_5867-48852-0019 IMMEDIATELY INTUITIVELY AND INFALLIBLY DISCERNIBLE AND EACH FIXED FOREVER IN WHATEVER BIT OF EXPERIENCE IT QUALIFIED ONE DOES NOT SEE HOW THERE COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY
911-128684-0081_2384-152900-0070 BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THESE WORDS ARE WORDS OF SORTING AMBIGUITY IS NATURAL FOR THEN AS SOON AS THE RELATIONS OF A THING ARE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS IT CAN BE SORTED VARIOUSLY
911-128684-0083_163-121908-0006 THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
911-128684-0085_4406-16882-0042 AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE
